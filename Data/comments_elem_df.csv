ElementaryTeachers,Representation is important in the classroom. Every child should find at least one book they can relate to at school.
ElementaryTeachers,"anything to keep math from being too dry (and intimidating)- elementary students are absorbing so much, I think it's great to be able to engage different learners with different learning modalities- songs are always fun!"
ElementaryTeachers,"-Sometimes redirection is just the name of the game, honestly. That is to say, reeling them back in to the task at hand.

-kittiesandlaughs is right too, a good general rule is: if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it should be happening, it probably shouldn‚Äôt be. And copy things you see other teachers doing that work!

-In terms of the conversations about stuff like Fortnite and whatnot, redirect. ‚ÄúDo a self check and make sure that if you‚Äôre talking to the friends at your table, it‚Äôs a conversation about the activity!‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúThat sounds like a really fun game that you can play when you get home. But right now, we need to be focusing on this!‚Äù 

-Also it might be good to keep in mind that it‚Äôs just the beginning of the school year and it‚Äôs an after school program. So especially if you‚Äôve got kids on the younger side of elementary school (kindergarten, first grade..) they‚Äôre still getting accustomed to the school environment. 

-It being an after school program, the kids are likely pretty much spent by the time they get to you so they‚Äôre almost always going to be a little off task at least.

-Being cheerfully engaged usually works pretty well for me. 

-Be specific and direct with both critiques of a child‚Äôs unwanted behavior and praise of their positive behavior. They benefit from being clear on exactly what the behaviors are that you don‚Äôt want to see again, and why they shouldn‚Äôt do them. And also the exact behaviors you DO want to see more of and why they‚Äôre good.

   -Negative example: ‚ÄúYou need to take your tennis shoes off of the table top because that‚Äôs where you and your classmates eat. Your shoes have germs on the bottoms that will make you sick if they get in your food.‚Äù 
   
   -Positive example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so impressed by how focused you are on this activity! You‚Äôre going to learn a lot with all those smart questions you‚Äôre asking!‚Äù

-This would also be a good thing to keep in mind when the young girl does something like grabbing your arm again. Try saying something like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate it when you touch me without my permission. If you‚Äôd like to hold my hand again next time, you need to ask and then wait until I‚Äôve said yes or no.‚Äù

-Yelling never solves anything and that‚Äôs definitely not the sort of problem solving behavior you want to rub off on them. So when you‚Äôre talking to a child about a negative behavior you‚Äôve seen from them, calm but firm tones are key. 

-It‚Äôs also usually good to try not to generalize your comments about a behavior to a point where the child then just starts to feel like they‚Äôre the problem as a person. So avoid, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so off task, I‚Äôve asked you six times to come back to the table and work on the activity.‚Äù And try, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm noticing that your behavior is off task right now. I need you to come back to the table and continue working.‚Äù 

-If the off task behavior continues and it‚Äôs really something that‚Äôs bothering you, think about trying to find another way of doing the activity that may be more engaging to the students struggling to focus. 

-Also just in general it‚Äôs okay to be a little goofy with them on occasion. Kids love to laugh and they‚Äôre more likely to respect someone who they like and feel a connection with!

TLDR: sometimes you just gotta redirect a lot, honestly. If it seems weird to you, it probably shouldn‚Äôt be happening. Be a copy cat for successful techniques from other teachers! Keep in mind they‚Äôre likely still getting used to being back at school. It‚Äôs after school too so their brains may be a little bit mushy already. Cheerful engagement from you can really help. Be specific and direct when talking about behaviors. No yelling, speak calmly and firmly. Never make a child feel like a negative behavior is part of who they are as a person. After a certain point, it might be good to try reconfiguring the activity a different way for the kids still struggling to focus. It‚Äôs okay to be a little goofy sometimes with them! üòä"
ElementaryTeachers,"If it feels like it shouldn't be happening, it probably shouldn't be happening. Does the school have some sort of behavior plan in place? For example, I was in a school that had a system of a TEAM line in the hallway. Toes forward, Eyes forward, Arms forward, and Mouths muted. I could call out kids in the hallway when they weren't following a TEAM line. So check and see if the school has some sort of common language for expected behavior.  

Positive behavior reinforcment ALWAYS does wonders. Call out the good behaviors! Oh Jimmy thank you for being so respectful, responsible, kind, on task, helpful, etc. That can help the other kids get on track. 

Watch other teachers. See what works for them and try some things out! Colleagues can be a great resource. 

Good luck! Kids are great, but the challenges can burn you out if you aren't careful. Have fun!"
ElementaryTeachers,"We all die soon. May as well make this life worth it. Do positive you everyday. See where it goes, even when ppl say that‚Äôs cray. Just do positive u"
ElementaryTeachers,I lack a lot of self confidence I used to have :(
ElementaryTeachers,"This guy needs +1 confidence booster. Command the room my guy, it will follow "
ElementaryTeachers,"These are the typical questions that I would ask... Was something up with this little one? Was she not feeling well? Not happy with something at school? Or at home? Or with a friend? Does she have any special needs? Little ones often can not articulate these needs. Can Mom or Dad offer any insight? Then, what makes her ‚Äútick‚Äù? What does she love? If it is art, maybe she wants to draw her numbers. If it is math maybe she wants to count jumping jacks. Always remember, she will want to feel liked. If you give her positive vibes she is more likely to be positive. I hope this helps."
ElementaryTeachers,"First year teaching. Grain of salt, but would love feedback!

One focus I have in my classroom is to know how to communicate (with peers/adults/self). How I introduce myself will also be an activity for the students to know how to listen, agree/disagree, and add-on to what I say.

* Pre-assess how to agree/disagree with a point, providing examples
   * You could get silly with a kids and give non-examples of extreme agreeing (OMG I love your idea \*hug\*) or disagreeing (well...I wouldn't yell at them, but you get the idea).
* Tell students to see where they can agree or disagree in a story about you
   * This is a great way for them to *practice the communication skills* you want to see in your classroom
* Talk about yourself!
   * Name, interesting fact, favorite hobby, pets, or any other ice-breaker facts
      * Don't forget any shameless plugs to colleges, favorite books, local/pro sports teams
   * Now is a great time to positively reinforce good communication skills of agreeing, disagreeing, or visual signs of active listing (looking at speaker, sitting up straight, etc)
* ""Quiz time"" (fun worksheet)
   * Fill out a sheet to answer questions about your story, allowing space to draw instead of or to add on to answering with words
      * Table below being an example

|Name|One word to describe me|
|:-|:-|
|Favorite subject|Interesting fact|

* Allow students to make their own ""Get To Know Me"" worksheet to fill out the table with their own answers about themselves. 

With parent's permission to put pictures of them on the worksheets, they can be displayed on a wall. Students already seeing their work published, faces to names to study after school, and you can see some ways you can personally reach out to students to show you love them."
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely dress professionally, like a teacher. And act like...yourself. if you're bubbly and happy and bubbly and happy, if not, be grounded. Teachers and administrators come into contact with tons of people every day, it's pretty easy to pick out the fakers! Good luck on your interview."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm currently getting my BA in elementary education at Western Governors University! It‚Äôs fully accredited across all 50 states so you‚Äôll be able to take your exams immediately after graduation.

I worked full time before the coronavirus, and live with my boyfriend too and the nice part about WGU is that it‚Äôs a flat fee per semester and you can take as many classes as you can fit in each term. There‚Äôs also no set class times so you can do your classes on your time. 

And as someone who has career hopped and gone to at least 3 different colleges I can say that this has been the best experience I‚Äôve had in school. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone. PM me if you have any questions!"
ElementaryTeachers,"a couple of my coworkers completed their bachelors online and were able to work mostly full time at their regular (adjustments were made for classroom observation hours) and they were able to complete it in the same 4-year time frame.

online isn‚Äôt for everyone (i personal preferred seeing my instructor face to face) but it‚Äôs one to keep in mind, especially if you are still wanting to work similar hours to what you have now :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve never done online learning beyond getting a CDA certificate, so I‚Äôm not too sure about what would be most successful but if I do it traditionally I‚Äôd need afternoon/night classes"
ElementaryTeachers,are you thinking of getting your degree traditional or online?
ElementaryTeachers,"It does seem weird at first but they actually are happy they didn‚Äôt have to do any work to find possible employees. If you want, go to the school and ask if the principal is around to speak to. You can drop your resume off directly to them and they also see your face and have the opportunity to speak to you!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!! I was always nervous that principals would be annoyed if I sent them emails about my interest in positions. It seems like it worked for you though!!
ElementaryTeachers,"I just got my first job as a second grade teacher! I practiced common interview answers in my photobooth app and recorded them. I E-mailed principals the following: 


‚Äú Dear Principal ****,

I am writing to apply for the position of an Elementary Teacher. **** Elementary has a great reputation for both academic excellence and a caring school community within the **** area. I believe my personal experience and background would make me a valuable addition to your school faculty.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (1-5) and a Masters of Arts in Teaching from ******. My yearlong student teaching was in a third-grade math and science classroom in *****.  I have developed strong communication skills with parents from experience at a **** for several years. I also value the importance of team collaboration to create a professional work environment. I believe my positive reinforcement skills and classroom management will help me to create a positive classroom for my students.

I would enjoy discussing the position with you. Please contact me with a convenient time to discuss career options. 

Sincerely, ‚Äú 

I also attached my resume and references. Some principals will reply and some will not. Some may even forward your information to other principals they know. Once they reach out to you, do not be nervous that you don‚Äôt have experience. They reached out to you because you‚Äôre qualified for the job!!! They also want a fresh pair of eyes to look at curriculum. Be confident!!! In the interview, they want to get to know you and find out if you‚Äôd be a good fit for their school environment. Answer them honestly but don‚Äôt negatively speak about anything.. students, teachers, experience, or anything! Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I just accepted my 1st teaching position last week, so I know what your going through. One thing I did that got my hired, was really looking into the school/district/community you will serve. Being able to speak about intelligently about why you want to work with those kids, and specifics that school goes a long way! 

Good luck! Don‚Äôt lose hope, you will find your perfect school!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!! This is so helpful!
ElementaryTeachers,"Both of my jobs were accepted the first week in July. Some contracts are signed on again until relatively late which means the candidate pool is smaller, and worked out for me! 

That being said, I didn‚Äôt just walk in to my classroom. I didn‚Äôt get a summer job after college because getting a job was my job. My state and surrounding states were full- I knew that going in. So I applied to every school district and county in 4 states. It was literally a 9-5 job. I had to go far to get my first position. My second was much MUCH closer to home. 

I had binders for my interviews (I would do a digital one now though) that showed my work. I broke it down into categories with samples of my proudest work. I also had a little section in the back of a thank you note from a parent and all the notes kids wrote. It was just a cute personal touch one interviewer enjoyed a lot. You might have done one for student teaching, if not, spend the day/weekend working on it. It was a joy to make. 

My coworkers who hate interviews say they don‚Äôt like to brag about themselves. I like interviews because you paint a picture of who you are and what your classroom is like to someone who hasn‚Äôt been there. You get to share your passion with someone (or a group of people depending on the interview) who love teaching as much as you. You‚Äôre fresh out of college so your energy and enthusiasm to start your dream will be unmatched. But just to be prepared, look up common interview questions. And develop a list of questions to ask them. Remember- you‚Äôre interviewing them too!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Figure out if your child is an auditory, kinesthetic, visual, or read/write learner and go from there! :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"You must be talking about online learning? I am just planning for next year, where I expect my area will be back to school, but I like your ideas!"
ElementaryTeachers,"You can mix it up though. Here‚Äôs what I do that works for me. I teach second. I assign work for the whole day. Students work at own pace to complete it. So there is the flexibility there. I also have a google meet once a day for 20-30 mins. One to go over work, four others are flexible. I‚Äôve been doing games and other activities. Perhaps you could do a Friday fun day meet? Math games on Kahoot or other platform?"
ElementaryTeachers,Oh no. Chaos in a classroom is never boring. Consistency is key. Students crave a set schedule. They have enough chaos going on at home they don‚Äôt need any more.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, I may be late, but I just released my multiplication table game on iOS. Maybe you could try it.

ElementaryTeachers,"Depending on his reading level, The Who Was series could be perfect."
ElementaryTeachers,"Have you checked out the ‚ÄúWho Was ...‚Äù series? It might be for a grade or two above, but maybe he can have someone at home help read them? There‚Äôs tons of them and all the kids I know love them."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you üôèüèº
ElementaryTeachers,Prodigy! It‚Äôs such a fun game and you can assign things based off state standards. They take a progress quiz initially (they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a quiz) and it will give them leveled questions!
ElementaryTeachers,You might want to be more specific with your details like where this is happening. That will help others figure out if they can help you or not.
ElementaryTeachers,"I would check the regulations for teachers from other countries for each state you‚Äôre interested in! For example, google ‚ÄúFlorida teaching certification‚Äù and on their department of education website, you‚Äôll find out everything you‚Äôd need to do as someone from outside the country/if your certificate would be accepted there. Hope this helps!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"It would largely depend on the state. The unfortunate thing about the American education system is that the regulations, both for curriculum and certification, are vastly different in every state. For example, here in PA, there are certain benchmarks that teachers need to hit prior to certification (certain amount of hours in the classroom, with mentor, etc). Each one of those benchmarks vary across state lines. There are also tests that need to be taken on content and pedagogy."

ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for your suggestions!
ElementaryTeachers,"Good luck, you‚Äôll do great! I‚Äôm changing districts now, and this is my second time interviewing ‚Äúfrom a distance‚Äù with a new distance, here‚Äôs some tips form my experience:

-be SPECIFIC in your answers, try not to speak in the abstract, own your beliefs and your choices. (Also, for me, the mantra of ‚Äúbe specific‚Äù helps limit my nervous rambling lol)

-research the school before you talk to them, makes you feel a little more at ease &amp; then you can start developing your own questions

-think about what‚Äôs important for YOU in a school. For example, it‚Äôs important to me that I work somewhere that values teacher input, so I ask each school I interview with ‚Äúwhat value does teacher input have in your school?‚Äù Reactions to questions are just as telling as answers to questions

-off of the above point, watch the TEACHERS reactions. For example, to the above question I once had two administrators talk on and on about their systems and how it‚Äôs important that they have teacher buy in &amp; they send surveys... meanwhile the teacher in the interview had suddenly become very quiet. Same question at another school and the teachers were talking over each other to rave about their admin and how valued they feel

-if you know anyone even a little connected to the district you‚Äôre moving to, REACH OUT. Check your school‚Äôs alumni network, ask your advisors and professors your close with. A foot in the door is huge

I know this is an intimidating process, I did a similar thing when I graduated 6 yrs ago and I‚Äôm doing it again now. It‚Äôs always worked out, schools need teachers.

Edit: attempted to fix garbage mobile formatting"

ElementaryTeachers,[abcya.com](https://abcya.com) offers fun learning games (both in math and ELA) that target different grade levels. Plus it's free :)
ElementaryTeachers,I would ask her teacher. This is a space for teachers to share their experiences and insight with other teachers.
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for the help :) Appreciate it!
ElementaryTeachers,Prodigy!

ElementaryTeachers,"prodigy math, fun math.com"
ElementaryTeachers,"Mobymax, and it's free right now."
ElementaryTeachers,I put my kids on XtraMath. It‚Äôs free and online flashcards but it individualizes it for each kid. It also sends reports on progress. The default is 3 second response time but you can change it for kids that are struggling.
ElementaryTeachers,I came here to say Khan academy too.
ElementaryTeachers,"Substitute teaching is absolutely the best advice you can give her. If she only does internships where she is assisting teachers in the classroom, or helping kids afterschool, she will NOT get a full taste of what teaching is like. Subbing isn't exactly like teaching, either, but at least she can see the ""good, the bad and the ugly"" and decide if teaching is worth it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I love Khan academy for math, since you can go in by grade level and skill and has scaffolds built in."
ElementaryTeachers,"As far as I know, there is no blanket certification in the US and every state has different requirements. California,  for example, is one of the most difficult states to get a credential in. You must take several different subject matter tests before you can even get accepted into a school /receive your credential."
ElementaryTeachers,Hang out with kids. Seriously find out if you want to spend time with them. Too many new teachers find out after going to school for a while that they just don‚Äôt like kids.
ElementaryTeachers,You need to be more specific. You didn‚Äôt even put a grade level that you need to do this for. Integrated math and science lessons are vastly different between five year olds and eighteen year olds.
ElementaryTeachers,"It is different in every state but I got mine from University of Chaminade in Honolulu. To the best of my knowledge, most states require just a bachelor's degree in any field and the ability to pass a background check to become an emergency hire. You may have to pass a test or have a few child development classes. You can get all of the information on your states education department website."
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs the school I‚Äôve been looking into but I‚Äôm struggling to get through my one prerequisite of Algebra 2 though. Any tips?
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe look into WGU?
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,Where did you get your masters if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Also what is required to be an emergency hire teacher?
ElementaryTeachers,I did an 18 month master's all online execpt student teaching. You could consider becoming an emergency hire teacher and then going for the master's.
ElementaryTeachers,Cool! I will definitely look into it and use it. Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,If you‚Äôd like to give them activities to complete on their or or even during zoom calls you can use nearpod! It allows you to use activities online! They have a cool feature (I haven‚Äôt used it yet but my professor showed us) where you can take a virtual field trip to some place and they show you around. It was a nice interactive alternative to powerpoints hopefully it can help! (I‚Äôm just a college student on my third year so I don‚Äôt have many resources but that‚Äôs one I really liked and used for a mini lesson)
ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, what she is doing is fine. Get schedule is already full! As college goes on, so many opportunities will open up for her that could range from volunteering as a tutor in a school to doing an extra curricular event(s)."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm going to be leaving the state I‚Äôm currently a resident in in a couple years is the thing so I‚Äôd have to get certified in another state afterwards anyways! Are there any programs you would you recommend?
ElementaryTeachers,This is super helpful. Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"It couldn‚Äôt hurt to mention it to his pediatrician next time you visit, and discuss it with his teacher. Better to catch potential problems early! I would practice with him as much as possible in different media‚Äîpaint, sand, dry jello, shaving cream, as well as pencil and paper. Outline them for him and let him go over it with paint, for example."
ElementaryTeachers,"I also got my bachelors degree in another field and then did a 15 month masters program to get my certification. My biggest tip for you would be to look up the options for your specific state that you‚Äôre looking to teach in. As someone who has looked into transferring states after certification, it can really be a pain so try looking up your state!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I taught 2nd grade for 11 years, and now I‚Äôm in my 4th year teaching 3rd grade. I had a good handful of 2nd graders who reversed letters, and every now and then, even a third grader will. By itself, it‚Äôs really not cause for concern- especially if kids are meeting all their literacy milestones. Usually they just grow out of it!"
ElementaryTeachers,"What you've described wouldn't concern me for his age. At his age with reading it is common to see children omit the middle and end sounds and sometimes the beginning of the word, they will reverse words, they will insert words that aren't even there, or use part of a word to guess if they don't know the word, just to name a few things kids do when learning to read. This is all perfectly normal. 

Your school has probably given you some sight words for him to work on. Just focus on those. Have him practice writing and reading each word by itself, and have him look for those words while he is reading. If he misreads one of those words then remind him it's a sight word and to go back and check that he read it correctly. Any other words he misreads, I wouldn't correct him, this way he won't get discouraged. As he master's sight word (he can read them quickly and correctly without having to think about it) then celebrate his success, remove those words from his practice words, and add new sight words to learn. He will love getting to check off words that he's mastered. 

You can do the same thing with any numbers that he writes backwards. Have him choose one or two numbers that he reverses and set a goal to write those numbers correctly. For example, he decides to focus on writing 4 correctly. After you finish math, remind him to check his number writing goal. If any 4s are backwards have him correct only that number. Once he consistently writes it correctly then celebrate and have him choose another number to focus on writing correctly."
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs a great idea. Although I‚Äôm less concerned about him figuring it out eventually and more worried that he may have a learning disability.
ElementaryTeachers,"7 in August.

Edit: he is in a Montessori school currently and working on kindergarten level tasks as far as I can tell. His learning at school is almost exclusively in Spanish.  Not sure if that has anything to do with it. (We are North Americans living in Puerto Rico)"
ElementaryTeachers,For certification to teach in the US?
ElementaryTeachers,Yes I know I‚Äôd get paid more with a masters just trying to see if anyone knows of any certification programs that are online and can be completed in a year?
ElementaryTeachers,"The quickest would probably be a certification program. Although you would get paid more $ with a masters. Not that $ is the end goal, but def something to think about. Masters would probably take around 2 years I don‚Äôt know much about certification programs."
ElementaryTeachers,Did he recently turn 6 or is he going to be 7 soon?
ElementaryTeachers,"That is a little more rare than number and letter reversal, although I've seen it happen with kindergarteners. You may want to push to have him assessed for any learning disabilities. If you catch them early it's more helpful than if you wait!"
ElementaryTeachers,You could put a number line or numbers 0-10 in front of him so he can double check his numbers are facing the write way.
ElementaryTeachers,UNB gets you certified in 10 months.
ElementaryTeachers,"One other thing I noticed today... he is just learning to read and occasionally he sounds 
words out backwards. Nuf instead of Fun for example. Is that just more of the same or would both the reading and writing point to a larger issue?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yeah it‚Äôs usually not all of them... this was the first time I‚Äôve seen that. Typically he gets about half right. I asked him about it today and he said that because he was writing on a blank page and not a notebook, he got confused. I guess he uses the turned page that you don‚Äôt typically write on to know which direction to face his numbers or something. I dunno. It was a head scratcher for me..."
ElementaryTeachers,"At 6 years old, number and letter reversals are normal. By the end of first grade, you could expect most to all numbers and letters to be formed correctly. However, each child is unique and developes at their own pace.

Credentials: Master's of Teaching in Elementary Education"
ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs not always a concern this young- sometimes it‚Äôs just developmental, and all kids develop at a little bit of a different rate. My concern is that ALL of the numbers are backwards- not just some of them. I would definitely touch base with your kiddo‚Äôs teacher about this- just to be safe!"
ElementaryTeachers,"More teaching videos on my YouTube Channel, Feel free to use them! üôÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,"This is so exciting!  Congrats, I teach 3rd grade as well and I started my theme as my favorite color.  I then decided I wanted the theme to be based around my students so I made everything I hung up (not essentials) stuff they made and created.  It definitely helps engage them in activities and assignments when they know their work can be put on display!  I give them the choice."
ElementaryTeachers,"Great insight! Thank you!

Her team hasn't been the most collaborative across this. And sadly, there's little collaboration across schools."
ElementaryTeachers,"This is a poorly drawn example of the concept of multiplication as area. Color would have been better than all those stupid lines.

See attached for two example on serve multiplication as area. First 2x3 and then 2/3 x 1/2. In each example, start at the bottom left corner of a grid of squares, and counted over one of the numbers of the multiplication problem. Then shade (in green in my drawing) all the grid squares that fall into that range from where you started that distance over. In my drawing I went over three. Then count up the other number of squares, or in this case 2, and then shade all the squares that are in this range (ie all the squares that are 2 or lower. You can see i shaded these yellow. How many squares are shaded both green and yellow? You can see that those 6 squares make up a rectangle that is 2 units by 3 units. So multiplication can be seen as area.

When it comes to fractions, the same thing works, but you have to add new grid lines to subdivide accordingly. You can see for the 2/3 I subdivided the first column of squares into three equal columns which gives us 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 (which I simply labeled as 1), and I shaded the first two columns because that‚Äôs 2/3rds. I then went up 1/2 and shaded across. You can see that 2 of these new smaller rectangles end up shaded both green and yellow out of a total of 6 little rectangles that together make up the first regular square (or the number 1). So, since numerator is the number of equal size pieces, and denominator is the total number of those equal size pieces that make up a whole, we get 2/6 as an answer.

Hope that makes sense! If kids can learn this concept for how multiplication works, and how fractions can be represented (as both points along the number line that fall between the whole numbers AND as parts of the whole square) they will have a much deeper understanding of quantity going forward that will pay huge dividends in their understanding of all mathematics that is yet to come. This concept is fundamental to all math. https://i.imgur.com/1APDuay.jpg"
ElementaryTeachers,"First, for google classroom, since she has it from the district, I hope the district has people who can support with configuration and use. If she needs more help than they can give, or just wants another voice, check out https://sites.google.com/view/steampoweredlearning They are doing daily sessions to answer questions and help with google tools. I know the educator who runs this, and he‚Äôs very good.

For reading time, do you mean her reading a book to the kids? If so, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with slides and voice over. The students are accustomed to seeing her holding the book, and reading it to them. Find a well-lit (natural light is best) place in your home where she can sit and read the book outloud. Simply point your phone at her and record or use the webcam on the chromebook. I‚Äôm guessing your phone will make a better video. If you have a Bluetooth hands free setup so you can mic her, sound quality would be better. If you are going to invest money, do it on audio. Decide what your primary recording device will be...chromebook, phone, MacBook, whatever, and get a good mic that is compatible. I bought a Blue ‚ÄúSnowball‚Äù mic and it works very well on my MacBook for $70. 

Note: research exists about student performance and sound quality. In a classroom, even having a mic and speakers to amplify your voice can improve student performance and learning. Over computers, you want to really make sure your audio quality is solid ‚Äî especially with young kids. 

She can post the videos of her reading to google classroom so that it can only be seen by the kids and not the public. That‚Äôll remove issues around copyright. 

She can use google to host video chats with kids individually, small groups or even full group. I recently interviewed a first grade teacher who has been teaching online to first graders since 2016 for her tips and advice. It‚Äôs on my podcast https://edmoxie.com/TL4Ed Look for the episodes with Tiffany Roberts. I‚Äôll be interviewing a 25 year veteran kindergarten teacher next weekend (4/18) to talk about science instruction with K-5 kids who are home. She can sign up and attend the live recording session if she wants to and ask questions to my guest expert. You‚Äôll see details on that on the same podcast I shared above. Tuesday (4/14) next week, I‚Äôll interview a school librarian about helping kids with reading and books,etc. with school and many public libraries closed. That‚Äôs on the schedule too. 

There must be other 1st grade teachers in her building/district? Teaming up would be helpful. Could be as simple as, when she wants to do 30 minutes of video meeting with her class, her peer teacher is there as a co-moderator to help push the buttons, etc as needed or even field questions from parents who are struggling with the tech. Likewise, she can do the same for her peer. It‚Äôs tough to try and teach and troubleshoot at the same time...if someone has a baby brother that is crying in the background, knowing you have a partner who can mute that microphone is really helpful.

She may find that for some lessons, it‚Äôs possible and beneficial to have both her classroom and her peer‚Äôs classroom together on one giant video meeting. If the goal that day was to simply read a book to the kids, then why not have one teacher read to all the kids instead of each of them repeating the process. The kids will like seeing the other kids from the other classes. That‚Äôs important for them. At school, they see each other at recess. Now, they may be limited to only seeing each other during these video calls, and then only with their main classroom group. So some of their friends won‚Äôt be there since they may be in a different homeroom. They can also build it up as a treat that tomorrow‚Äôs story time will be special because they have a guest reader. 

Good luck! Keep the questions coming! Plenty of people here with ideas to help!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you so much for your insight, and best of luck to you also! I applied on Edjoin, and I didn‚Äôt see a place where I could include it! My application has all of the necessary things, so I guess I don‚Äôt technically ‚Äúneed‚Äù it, but all of this extra free time makes me overthink! I put a lot of work into it, so I will debate sending the email!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I created a portfolio with student references and samples of my work. I attached it to my application as a work sample. If you have the option to include in in your application somewhere, I think that‚Äôs best. Otherwise, I think sending an email isn‚Äôt the worst thing, but I‚Äôd leave it as a last resort since it requires the principal and hiring manager to take extra steps. I think it‚Äôs important to do whatever you can to set yourself apart, so I wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs annoying. 

Source: My step mom has been a CEO for companies, in another field, and has tons of experience hiring people. She‚Äôs been my soundboard for the application process and recommends a portfolio. She says as long as you‚Äôre not pestering them, showing initiative is valuable."
ElementaryTeachers,"My dojo has everyone in the building connected from admin, nurses, and coaches. But that‚Äôs my building.

Check to see if your coworkers are in the same position!"
ElementaryTeachers,My instructional coach just asked to be added to my Class Dojo as a student. No explanation as to why she wanted to be. She‚Äôs never been a part of my lesson planning or instructional planning all year. It feels weird and very snoopy to me. I don‚Äôt want to add her.
ElementaryTeachers,"You can go to Northern Essex Community College's website and sign up for an MTEL prep course.  I used and recommend their Foundations of Reading course.  It was $100 when I took it and I aced the multiple choice.  You can go here: [https://www.necc.mass.edu/noncredit/occupational-training-development/teaching-online-mtel-prep/](https://www.necc.mass.edu/noncredit/occupational-training-development/teaching-online-mtel-prep/) and scroll down to any of the three subjects you listed.  Note that the math subtest is lumped in with the other mathematics levels, and is not with the multi-subject subtest.  Hope this helps!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I personally would not want my admin to be in my Dojo. Go do your job and I'll do mine. If I need help/support, I'll ask."
ElementaryTeachers,They may be bored and just monitoring what everyone is doing.  If you haven‚Äôt had any complaints I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about it
ElementaryTeachers,"Agreed on sticking with what is approved by the district, and team collaboration.

Sadly, there's not much that is ""approved"" that is accessible to K-4 grades, and the district has definitely dropped the ball on using tech for kids in those grades. 

She has been in daily meetings with her team of only 5. 1 teacher is on the verge of retirement, and doesn't understand remote learning, at all. Another wants to do nothing at all until the administration tells them exactly what to do, step by step, every inch of the way for their exact classroom. Another is sort of agreeable to what the majority wants, and then my wife and her friend are trying to keep things moving forward.

Unfortunately, the district hasn't been prepared for this with lower grades, nor have they prepared the teachers much in those grades. My wife is a bit scattered right now, and I've been doing my best as an IT worker, to help her produce more robust content for her kids. 

We'll look into your recommendations today! Thanks for the input!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Flipgrid, Padkwt, and DeckToys are awesome but she should stick with what her kids are familiar with, and already approved in her district. We have gotten the directive that e-learning should be the same within grade levels- same lessons, same resources/programs/ expectations. So, of course she should colloborate with her team to maintain consistency.  We are getting started next week. Best wishes!"
ElementaryTeachers,Good luck! It‚Äôs new territory for everyone including them. I‚Äôd have your resume and maybe some references on a google doc that you‚Äôve made shareable so that if someone is at the meeting they weren‚Äôt anticipating or if they can‚Äôt find your resume you can quickly link it in the chat box of zoom. Also definitely dress as you would for an in-person interview (that probably goes without saying). Let us know how it goes!
ElementaryTeachers,Unfortunately the whiteboard is a paid thing. Hopefully your school notices that and either pays it for you or allows you to use zoom. I looked it up and found [this link](https://www.webwhiteboard.com/hangout) as a number one recommended so hope that helps. There‚Äôs also something called nearpod that‚Äôs let‚Äôs you create interactive lessons for students but no video calls for that as far as I know. It‚Äôs just a PowerPoint type thing where you can add activities and only you can change the slide.
ElementaryTeachers,"You'll be fine, I think their be many Teachers retiring due to this China Virus19,  take a deep breath and know that you are qualified, good luck."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hello, I just got my very first teaching job the week before the schools all closed. It was actually my first interview too so I do not have that much experience; however, it did just happen. To me it felt like they wanted to know why I wanted to work for THAT school, that I would follow the curriculum, and that I would work well as a grade level team member. There were many questions like, "" if I were to walk into your classroom in the middle of the day, what would I see?"" And, how would you handle a disagreement between you and another teacher in your team?"" Things of that nature. 

Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,There is a debriefing statement at the end of the survey that will further explain the study. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to message me privately and I'll be happy to help in any way! I ask you do not comment here in fear of biasing other participants.

ElementaryTeachers,I'm a big fan of Love That Dog &amp; Inside Out and Back Again for poetry in upper elementary. Otherwise I have analyzed song lyrics with my third graders. They liked The Show by Lenka and Roar by Katy Perry. Both have great positive messages for kids.

ElementaryTeachers,"Associates won't help much. I work as a paraprofessional at an elementary school;  it's like a teachers aid, but I don't work under a teacher. It's pretty much as close as you can get to being a teacher without having a bachelor's. Someone without an associates could get the job too. Only difference is they need to take a paraprofessional test which covers general education topics."

ElementaryTeachers,"When I first started teaching I'd be at work at 8 and would stay until 8. Now that I have a child I have to leave at 4. It is a LOT of work.  I often work on grading, report cards, data, and planning at home."
ElementaryTeachers,"I know it isn't always possible given constraints with curriculum, but when we didn't have prescribed units, I could always get reluctant writers to write fantasy or really over the top silly fiction!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, the thing that has worked the best for me is being excited about my writing myself and celebrating successes of those reluctant writers. I also find that choice is key. Maybe you‚Äôre already doing all those things already though..."
ElementaryTeachers,I have an Associates in Arts that I had to get before starting my Bachelors. I didn‚Äôt know that that was a thing that you could get? I thought it was just AA and AS

ElementaryTeachers,"Energy. When I teach with energy and enthusiasm I find my students are more engaged. If I‚Äôm having an off day, or if I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep I find it‚Äôs harder to keep their attention. "
ElementaryTeachers,"When I first started I spent a lot of time working on things at home. Most of my colleagues stayed and worked in their rooms, but I preferred being at home, so I would go home and work on lesson plans and projects there. 18 years later I rarely do anything at home. I‚Äôve been lucky to be in the same room, teaching the same content for all of this time. I‚Äôm not saying I do the same thing over and over. When I change things I use my planning and lunch to do them at school so I can enjoy my time at home without thinking of school. "
ElementaryTeachers,"I have to make a lot of new things because our curriculum changed, so it‚Äôs hard to say. Sometimes I do it more on less on the spot and quick make one up. Other times (like for choice boards) it takes longer but you don‚Äôt have to  do it like that if you don‚Äôt want to."
ElementaryTeachers,"Ooh, that‚Äôs new to me! Are you having to create a lot of new materials?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Unfortunately the things I remember by teachers doing are not widely accepted and/or can't be used anymore. Teachers are not expected/allowed to do much direct instruction anymore, at least where I teach. They are just expected to do small group instruction and facilitate. Students are like busy worker bees, cramming in curriculum. "
ElementaryTeachers,"I think I heard there was a study that showed students are active for as long as their age. Don't know for sure, but if somebody does know where to find the study..."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think knowing your students is so important. You can plan an amazing lesson but if your students aren‚Äôt interested in the content or can‚Äôt relate to it, it won‚Äôt be effective. Try incorporating their interests into lesson plans. 

Kinesthetic activities are always great too, especially for younger students who are full of energy. I just wrote a phonics lesson that incorporated hopscotch, I had the kids jump on letters and sound them out at the same time, and then had them form words by hopping on letters and blending them. 

Brain breaks are also great to keep students engaged! It allows students to relax for a moment and regroup themselves. 
"

ElementaryTeachers,"I am on Mobil and relatively new at posting on reddit so I can‚Äôt include the link- but I highly recommend looking at it through BetterLesson.com. 

I did a series of PD with its sources! I use it with homework, centers, whole group lessons, morning work, and choice boards. 

My biggest tip is to include an exit ticket reflection afterwards at the beginning of implementation. At this point in the year (majority of)  my kids reflect without prompting!"
ElementaryTeachers,Ive read some about this. Maybe we can start a thread with more information on it.
ElementaryTeachers,"I just started differentiating with the Mild, Medium, and Spicy strategy! So easy to implement and use throughout the whole day. "
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for posting! Don‚Äôt feel any hesitation to post, hopefully we will all learn and get ideas from each other."
ElementaryTeachers,I've constantly hesitated from posting as this is my first year teaching and I don't want to give any bad (or not yet matured) advice. Thanks for stepping up. Can't wait to see this sub grow! 
ElementaryTeachers,"Pros: 
They should have leaned a lot from their kindergarten teacher about behaving at schools. Lines, raising hands, school procedures, etc.  

Still young and love attending schools.  

Great standards in both math and ELA. 

Con: Depending on your demographics you can have students reading at a kinder level or lower or as high as 2nd 3rd grade level, which means lots of differentiation. 

Either way you‚Äôll have a great year!!! Just make sure they know you care about them and you‚Äôll love it. I‚Äôve taught 1st for one year and a kindergarten for 3, very passionate about kinder could go on for hours but you‚Äôll love first too! 

Have fun and good luck! 
"
ElementaryTeachers,These standards were written without child development milestones in mind. They force children to do thinking they are not typically developmentally ready to do-- especially critical thinking skills such as synthesis and analysis. 
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for sharing! I will check it out!
ElementaryTeachers,"Google ""growing success document"". That's what we use in Ontario Canada and it's awesome. Conversations, observations, and product. 

I think it's such a good resource tool. "
ElementaryTeachers,"At my school we use number grades such as:
3 = Meets grade level expectations
2 = Developing the skills necessary with occasional support needed
1 = Progress is below grade level &amp; support is needed"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for sharing!!

Do most elementary schools do ABCDF grading scales or OSNU??

O = Outstanding

S = Satisfactory

N = Needs Improvement

U = Unsatisfactory

I remember I had OSNU when I was in elementary school but I wasn't sure if they still do that or not..."
ElementaryTeachers,"Do's

* include only students achievement when grading
* use an I for incomplete not a 0 that will hurt their average
* give students the opportunity to ""redo"" their mistakes
* involve students in the grading process

Don'ts

* reduce marks for being late
* factor in attendance
* include group scores
* grade every single assignment you give students"

ElementaryTeachers,"We‚Äôve walked similar paths! I graduated with my license and my first job in education was as a para, and being a para is what drew me closer to the younger grades as well. I‚Äôm glad I could help, good luck! "
ElementaryTeachers,"I love and agree with so much of what you said.  I‚Äôm a ParaEducator working on my teaching license.  I originally thought I would like 3rd grade, but have recently been leaning towards lower grades.  Never Kindergarten, but possibly 2nd.  I love the 1st graders I come into contact with now, but still curious if it‚Äôs the right fit for me.  Thank you for your thoughtful response!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hello! First grade teacher here! Context for you; I went into student teaching and job searching thinking I‚Äôd NEVER go below third grade. I swore intermediate was the life for me. Then I got a job offer in first grade....

Pros: HUGS. all the time. Many times a day. Even after you have to reprimand them. They hold no resentment. They‚Äôre enthusiastic. They‚Äôre funny (they got into an impassioned discussion the first day it snowed about whether or not the snowfall meant it was Christmas. It hadn‚Äôt even been Thanksgiving yet). Lots and lots and lots of ‚Äúlightbulb moments‚Äù. They learn so much at this age. Most of the time, they want to make you happy. They‚Äôre grateful (we did a cranberry science day before thanksgiving and they thanked me multiple times. For letting them eat cranberries. That they didn‚Äôt even like. To them, it was still fun.) They‚Äôre easy to impress. They love when I throw a mediocre at best drawing on an anchor chart. And I think the biggest pro is that they still believe in magic. Today we started Elf on a Shelf and they‚Äôre obsessed. They still believe in the holiday magic and the magic of learning and they still think that you as their teacher are one of the best people ever. 

Cons: This is a very chatty age for them. They learn a lot from interacting with one another and they have a hard time distinguishing between good times to talk and not so good times to talk. Multi step directions...good luck. It‚Äôs more like repeat the same directions multiple times. Many times they‚Äôre still working on reading, so with early finishers sometimes telling them ‚Äúread a book‚Äù isn‚Äôt the most viable option (personally, I still do it). They can be forgetful. They‚Äôve asked me for missing gloves, hats, scarves, etc. more times than I can count and it isn‚Äôt even December. Handwriting can be interesting. Short attention spans. Constantly being asked to tie shoes. Sometimes the shoe laces are in a hopeless knot because they tried to do it themselves. 

Personally, for me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I never expected to love first grade as much as I do. They make me smile every day. 

edit: formatting and spelling"
ElementaryTeachers,Both of these comments are very true!
ElementaryTeachers,Cons they can't read or do math. Pros they are cute and very excited to learn. 
ElementaryTeachers,I have them in my school. They‚Äôre not nesting in there but they come from our students‚Äô homes. We keep our personal belongings inside clear garbage bags. I once had a Kinder say there‚Äôs a bug on my bottle and I went to see and it was crawling on his sweater :@

ElementaryTeachers,Where did you get the education for software engineering?
ElementaryTeachers,"Hello, I made the move from teaching to tech a few years back and it‚Äôs been very difficult but also very rewarding in terms of working from home and flexible hours. I get paid more than when I was a teacher and the best part is that I am working with teachers who use my app in their classroom. If you‚Äôre open to programming, I‚Äôd recommend it, it took me 1.5 years to go from knowing nothing to getting my first software engineer internship which turned into a full time position."
ElementaryTeachers,Hugs
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, it‚Äôs so unique for everyone. I work with people who love it and don‚Äôt mind all the behavior issues and always being ‚Äúon‚Äù. I get really tired and have some physical pain issues. I think teaching has become more for thick skinned, type A personalities in some ways and more detrimental to empaths. I‚Äôm thinking small groups are better for me. Good luck to you. I‚Äôm glad I did it because I‚Äôm stronger now, which may sound weird. But I don‚Äôt think I failed. I think I succeeded at knowing it‚Äôs not for me."
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh my, I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for you. I‚Äôm also an empath and I struggle, as I finish up my AA, with deciding if being a teacher is really something I want to do. I have no idea anymore what to do anymore."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! üòÉ
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt think the prestige of the school matters. I recently started school at WGU (MAT elementary education) and before doing so, I asked the administrators at my school if it would be looked down on or not taken as seriously, and they said that it doesn‚Äôt really matter. I was a bit worried about doing my masters at an out of state AND online school, but was assured that it was completely fine and no one would care. I‚Äôm finding this to be true already. I only started my program in December, and am applying for teaching jobs now and have had interest from multiple schools. I‚Äôve had many interviews, am a finalist at 2 schools, and got 1 offer which I declined."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes! https://anchor.fm/ashley-serage

I hope that works!"
ElementaryTeachers,Love it!
ElementaryTeachers,Oh and how you give feedback! This is probably one of the biggest differences if I understand Montessori students learn through attempts and self correction.. Public school is more direct instruction. You need to be able to give feedback ... one of the *students* in the sample lesson is sure to make mistakes to see how you give feedback and help them reach understanding.
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm fond of the I do, we do, you do 

First I do .. you would model and explain, show 

We do... you do it together with the class

You do ... independent work

For a 15 minute lesson I'd focus on whichever part you feel comes across best. 

You can Google the standard to see how other people have taught it as well. 

Avoid focusing on the *cute* stuff like pinterest


You can look over stuff on teacherspayteachers but carefully .. theyre written by anyone and not all of them are *good* or they may focus on other standards. 

First ... what do you want kids to be able to do at the end of the lesson. Set an objective. Then figure out how to get there. How will kids show that they understand? Will they define a word? Will they fill in a sheet? When you have an idea of the objective the assessment kinda falls into place. 

If they hire you they will show you how they want lessons planned ...for now they are focused on how you teach. Your attitude, your ability to teach an objective, how you deal with behaviors and questions, your ability to teach it in 15 minutes (timing can be hard), and how well you follow the standard...aka can you teach that standard without going off the rails and such."
ElementaryTeachers,"Not trying to be rude either, but let's assume you somehow get this job, what are you going to do then? 

If a single demo lesson (that has literally been laid out for you step by step) is too much for you, how are you going to plan, prep and deliver 4-5 lessons a day?"
ElementaryTeachers,"A standard is just a goal for what the student should be able to accomplish after being taught the lesson. This one is about being able to find the meaning of unfamiliar words in a non-fiction text. So I would read through the readings they gave you and pick out vocab words and then create a lesson around context clues or using a dictionary. Make a worksheet to go with the readings that assesses the students ability to define the words after reading the text. Again, it's really straightforward."
ElementaryTeachers,I've never created a lesson around a public school standard because I'm Montessori trained and taught in a private Montessori school. So I don't know where to start.
ElementaryTeachers,Ok but what is confusing you...? They want you to create a lesson for that standard using the provided text(s). It's relatively straightforward.
ElementaryTeachers,"I haven't student taught yet, or been taught to make lesson plans either. I am Montessori trained, which is very different and doesn't necessarily follow state standards like public schools do. I am enrolled in a Masters program for elementary ed, but am only 3 months in. However, in my state, there's a tiered system for teaching licenses, and if you have a Bachelors and are enrolled in a teacher prep program, you can get a Tier 2 license if hired by a public or charter school which is what I'm trying to do. So I'm not new to teaching, but I am new to this. I hope that makes sense."
ElementaryTeachers,Ok I'm confused... You literally learn to make lesson plans in college and while student teaching... You should not be applying for a teaching job if you cannot make a lesson plan.  I'm not trying to be rude but looking at the instructions it seems painfully straightforward. How did you spend your time student teaching???

ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been in your place so my opinion may be outdated. It was very competitive in my area when I started applying for positions. The 100+ applications for 1 opening kind of situation. So my advice is apply quickly, focus the resume on your work with kids and passion for teaching, and try to be seen. That last part may be hard in our Covid world now. At the time, I‚Äôd stop by the school and try to meet/introduce myself to the principal and give them my resume. I still applied online of course, but I wanted them to put a face with the name and see my commitment to a position that I didn‚Äôt even have yet. I subbed in the school districts I was applying too as well. This allowed me to make some great contacts and show my capabilities. Most school systems, in my area anyway, are desperate for subs if they‚Äôre in person. Again, this may not be something your comfortable with in these times but something to think about."
ElementaryTeachers,"Congrats on your recent graduation!! 

The top 2 things I always looked for when I was hiring and interviewing teachers were **passion** and **growth mindset**. 

Since our school served a really specific population of students (Autism, ADHD, &amp; other learning disabilities), we needed teachers who were truly passionate about the work. It was also a startup school, which requires a lot of flexibility, so that was another key quality we needed. We provided a lot of in-house training and coaching, so we also looked for folks who are clearly committed to lifelong learning and always looking to proactively improve their practice.

Whenever I applied for a teaching job, I'd research the school ahead of time and include specific details in my cover letter about what uniquely appealed to me about their school, and what I could bring to the specific role I was applying for.

Since you're new, demonstrate your eagerness to learn and grow. Explain how your past job experiences have prepared you for the job you're applying for (i.e., at CFA they focus on leadership, and teaching is classroom leadership!).

Good luck!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I emailed one of the principals and she said she isn‚Äôt part of the hiring committee, but that she will let them know I reached out! Yeah, I think I should just keep applying. It sucks because the state is taking so long to deliver my certificates and transcripts. I ordered them in January and still have not gotten them. So, when I apply, I technically can‚Äôt put my certificates because they‚Äôre asking for a PDF and I don‚Äôt have them. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been emailing the principal saying ‚ÄúI have them, I just couldn‚Äôt put them‚Äù."
ElementaryTeachers,"First of all, I would get rid of anything on your resume that isn't work with kids. Not relevant imo. 
Getting your foot in the door depends on where you live. In my last area, I got a lot of interviews by directly e mailing principals of the schools I applied to. Where I live now, the websites specifically say not to do that so I just had to apply and wait... Still got a lot of interviews. Check postings frequently and apply quickly."
ElementaryTeachers,"My kids love to play Minecraft! Usually it‚Äôs saved for fun Friday in my class, but I use it as a reward from time to time as well. I‚Äôm fully f2f."
ElementaryTeachers,"I usually let them play educational games like prodigy, but I think it‚Äôs fine as long as it doesn‚Äôt become a problem! If they put it away after those 10 minutes and give their attention to you, then I see no problem with it!"
ElementaryTeachers,Yes!!!! I tried a million different search terms and had no luck! Wow that‚Äôs awesome thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,Just writing something using a lot of neuter and demonstrative pronouns and general adjectives!
ElementaryTeachers,I had no clue what you were after but I googled and googled and googled. I think I found it. If this isn‚Äôt it I‚Äôll eat my hat. https://studylib.net/doc/8754740/bransford-and-johnson--1972-if-the-balloons
ElementaryTeachers,"That would be a cool hook for a lesson. May be hard to find. Try doing a very specific search. Or check out content on the standard itself. There might be something there. If not, any article with imagery would work. For higher order thinking level questions, you can have them think of their own image they would add to an article for this reason. Maybe provide an article without an image. That could be your exit ticket."
ElementaryTeachers,LAFS.4.RL.3.7
ElementaryTeachers,What standard is it? I‚Äôve done pd on close reading strategies using this example.
ElementaryTeachers,"I am a teacher in Florida. Yes, our schools do it every day at the start of class. Our principal does it over the school news. Students start in Kindergarten. We cannot force a student to do it but I know teachers who get super bent out of shape when their students don't stand. I myself don't do it and think it's ridiculous but many a US citizen would accuse me of being disrespectful or not unsupportive of our military because I don't recite it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt believe there is an official rule at my school (or if there is then I clearly break it), but there are flags hanging in every classroom. I don‚Äôt have my kids say it. I find it creepy and unnecessary to force kids to recite something because words are just words. They should learn about their country and decide if they feel patriotic about it for themselves, not blindly pledge some arbitrary allegiance.

I also student taught at this school and my CT was a die hard to the pledge. He is a former marine and makes his students recite it every morning. He does say that he can‚Äôt make them actually say it, but he has consequences for students who do not stand during it."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes. I‚Äôm required to do it by state law or they will get someone else to come in my room to lead it. My kiddos are not required to participate. I‚Äôve made it clear, that is their choice if they want to do it or not."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm a 5th grade teacher, and yes, they say it first thing every morning after the bell. They also say the Texas pledge. 

I honestly don't care if they sit, stand, say it or not, but if an admin walks in and sees them, I'm in trouble for sure. I hate it.

I think kids can be exempt from saying the pledge with a parent letter to the school, but around here that basically forces you to make yourself and your kids pariahs in the little Bible-thumping community we have.

Fun (not really) fact: Texas added ""one state, under God"" to the pledge sometime after I finished grade school but before I started teaching. Ugh."
ElementaryTeachers,"In an Elementary context, definitely! Because young kids don‚Äôt know the pledge, I think you need to provide the opportunity to learn it. So in addition to cultural pressure- elementary teachers still have more legality issues to struggle with. Maybe I‚Äôm remembering this wrong.

The issues on an Elementary level is trying to teach students their rights in an uncontroversial manner. I‚Äôm sure it can be done in the right school district. I‚Äôd love to know how teachers go about this."
ElementaryTeachers,"My elementary school does it over the intercom each morning. Some of my fourth graders do it because that's what they were taught in prior grades. I don't always do it. I think loyalty and patriotism should be critical thinking skills, not done blindly. But this also is not the cross I want to die on, so I usually just let kids who want to do it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I wonder how it actually started, going to do some research later. I‚Äôll post little nuggets of info on this thread. It‚Äôs interesting to see teachers commenting that they didn‚Äôt realise other countries didn‚Äôt have this tradition."
ElementaryTeachers,"Not sure if they‚Äôd be able to opt into it in private since it‚Äôs done as a communal activity? It‚Äôs usually done over the loudspeaker or just said all together, so I guess kids could say it in their head like a prayer? That feels like it might be weirder than it already is. 
It‚Äôs just hard because kids are conditioned to participate without really understanding the purpose of it or it‚Äôs implications."
ElementaryTeachers,Yeah I would think so! I feel like sports games are probably one of the only places you might experience it on a regular basis as an adult if you don't work in government.
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks
ElementaryTeachers,You're welcome.
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks. Video did really well on tik tok...thought I should share
ElementaryTeachers,This put me in such a great mood. Your students are lucky to have you
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for that! 

Hypothetical scenario - a teacher to not acknowledge the pledge as a communial activity but rather having it as something that kids can opt in to in private - would that be seen as professional suicide? Or something that might actually be supported with good communication with parents?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Teacher here, and no. I hate making my kids say it. There were only a few years that the schools I taught at did it regularly, and I actively told kids why we say it and always gave them the option to not participate. The schools I‚Äôve taught in have also all been title 1 schools with predominantly students of color. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair to make them pledge allegiance to a country that doesn‚Äôt have their best interests at heart."
ElementaryTeachers,Very informative! Thanks for sharing. Would you say the number of occasions to say the pledge decreases as one grows older?
ElementaryTeachers,"This was fascinating to come across. I work at an elementary school in a fairly liberal area in California that I grew up in as well. It's definitely not demanded that you say the pledge, but it's just some weird thing you were conditioned to do when you were young. In high school for me I don't recall it being as expected, and I definitely never said it once in college. The elementary schools however, it is scary. Kids are taught it is an every day routine before they even know what they are saying. Like I said I live in a pretty liberal area, I hate saying it, but feel like I would definitely be questioned if I didn't say it in a public setting of a classroom or assembly, probably mostly by parents."
ElementaryTeachers,Any teachers out there totally in favour of the pledge? Interested to hear your opinions.
ElementaryTeachers,"A great insight, thanks! Sounds like there is a lot of cultural pressure to all parties?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm a student teacher, so I don‚Äôt have much experience, but I would say it‚Äôs generally accepted at the Elementary Level. I go to a fairly liberal prep school- I‚Äôve read about the language being hypocritical but not about changing it. I agree that it‚Äôs creepy but did not realize most countries don‚Äôt have pledges.

I had high school teachers who would openly inform us that we have the right to not say the pledge. So when it came time to do it we would all just sit for a little bit and do nothing including the teacher. Legally, you CANNOT get in trouble for not doing it. However, teachers are simultaneously legally responsible for creating the opportunity to."
ElementaryTeachers,"You're welcome, I'm here if you have any other questions!!! We definitely have religious schools here as well but as far as I know public schools are all secular because of separation of church and state."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for your answers! I was just curious to learn the basics - I find it fascinating. 

I went to a religious school (in Ireland most schools are actually run by the Catholic Church - a bit of a social hangover from our darker years) but we had to pray daily with a priest who broadcasted over the school intercom into each classroom. And that‚Äôs the experience of 90% of our school"
ElementaryTeachers,"Not at the dinner table but yes for govt business, sports games, and some school events."
ElementaryTeachers,It's been the subject of alot of debate. You can probably find hundreds of news stories about students refusing to stand for the pledge and it becoming a huge controversy in their school/community. Alot of people (including me) see it as a first amendment right to not be forced to stand for it. But others (mostly the conservative side) see it as an attack on the country.
ElementaryTeachers,Does it occur in any other occasion? The dinner table/social events/ official govt business?
ElementaryTeachers,You're not wrong at all we have a culture of extreme nationalism here in the U.S.
ElementaryTeachers,Is it generally approved of? Is it a proud tradition that‚Äôs widely accepted?
ElementaryTeachers,I don‚Äôt mean this to come across insulting/mocking but honestly - it‚Äôs like something out of the Hitler Youth?
ElementaryTeachers,Every morning in 1st period. I have no memory of learning the pledge but I'm assuming we all learned it super young.
ElementaryTeachers,"And how often does it occur? Daily?

And when do kids learn it?"
ElementaryTeachers,Yes and in alot of schools you will get in trouble if you don't stand for it
ElementaryTeachers,"Gregtangmath has fun interesting games my students like to play. 

Commoncoresheets.com had a really good online virtual platform now. Choose a standard and practice online. IXL but only 10 a day for free. 

Mathdiplomas.com and Timestables.com are great for math facts. Third grade makes a big jump and need a ton of practice. 

Prodigy is a great go to for engagement. It‚Äôs an old 8bit RPG type game like Final Fantasy where battles are done through math programs. Kids love it. 
A few of what I use in my third grade classroom. 

Let me know or DM if need anything else."
ElementaryTeachers,"Quizlet especially for reading theory type tests. You get decks of cards on content, strategies, theory etc. it‚Äôs portable and you can study anywhere especially when you are sitting on toilet. 

Best of luck to her and her journey."
ElementaryTeachers,My district started using EL education right in the beginning of the year. It didn‚Äôt align itself well for remote learning since a lot of the lessons involve a group work. I do have some resources I‚Äôm willing to share if you would like.
ElementaryTeachers,Those are some great ideas. Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Also check out ‚Äúhow to talk so kids will learn‚Äù by Adele Faber to help you with that awkward feeling when there is a tantrum or negative feelings.
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm a big believer in rich experiences with texts so I would say to do it all.you could change the focus each day. I mean, the characters are going to be either responding to another character or a plot point, so it makes sense. another option could be to jigsaw it- split the kids into groups, each group decides how the story affects a character and then presents that idea to the group. There's a lot of fun options! I often underestimate the power of repetition in my own teaching, but teach a skill any chance you get and there is a better chance of it sticking."
ElementaryTeachers,"Depending on where you live and the number of college credits you have, you might be able to be a substitute. Good luck! I started out thinking I wanted that age and realized that while I love small groups of 4-5 year olds, a whole class full is a lot. But I teach upper elementary and love it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think getting experience in real classrooms would be helpful! This will give you the chance to see if it's an area you feel comfortable being in. There's a lot of different aspects and parts to teaching that most people don't think about, so getting hands on experience will help you get a feel for if thats something you enjoy or want to do. Keep in mind, teaching is a lot more than just the fun work pages. 

Just because you don't think your personality is the ""teacher type"" doesn't mean you can't be an awesome teacher. Every teacher has their own style, personality, and flair that they bring to the classroom. You just have to find your own style that works for you. As long as it's something you're passionate in and you have a heart for teaching your students, you'll do great."
ElementaryTeachers,"Try to get experience in schools. You can email different principles and say you‚Äôre interested in teaching but not sure so you‚Äôd like to observe for a day. You also should ask the chair of the education department if s/he knows anyone you can observe or talk to. 

I hate public speaking (still do in front of adults or groups of other teachers) but it‚Äôs different in front of kids for me. However, what you‚Äôre feeling is completely valid. Some people are more bubbly in front of kids, some people are still shy/ awkward/ nervous regardless. It‚Äôs wise to try to figure it out now before you‚Äôre locked into a major. There also are other jobs that involve working with kids but not being a traditional teacher. Maybe you should consider that route too. 

Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,awesome have fun
ElementaryTeachers,This is cool! I think my 5th graders will enjoy it. Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,The students love it. Its fun. They need that right now.
ElementaryTeachers,What do you like about it?
ElementaryTeachers,Do experiments they can do at home!  I like tornado in a jar!  There are so many cool videos just on YouTube!

ElementaryTeachers,"As a teacher for years, often the only thing that gets the school's attention is the threat of legal action. File a police report againstthe student/parents, then threaten to sue the school for not protecting your child. The teacher's hands are likely tied in this situation - we have little power to have discipline enforced beyond our classrooms - so the target should be administrators."
ElementaryTeachers,"As someone who was also diagnosed late in my life, I hope you know that teachers like you are what's going to help break that cycle. Thank you for all that you do and for being part of the change in education!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I was diagnosed last year, as an adult. I have a very ADHD class this year and it is HARD but so rewarding. I try to be the teacher I wish I had in school as an ADHD kiddo. 

Thank you for doing this research. I really hope education will become more accepting of neurodivergent students and give us more opportunities for accommodating them."
ElementaryTeachers,Done!
ElementaryTeachers,Hello! Anyone with elementary school teaching experience is welcome to take this survey :)
ElementaryTeachers,I teach 5th grade and my son has ADHD. Would you want me to take your survey?
ElementaryTeachers,"To me, great coworkers and decent admin wouldn't be enough to sacrifice my mental health each day managing too many kiddos and dealing with angry parents, all while having zero faith in the curriculum I'm teaching.  

Oh... I think I just described *my* job.

Yeah, we should look for positions elsewhere. üòÖ

Seriously, though, when there are that many kids with just one teacher, the learning environment suffers, too. Find a position with a more reasonable class size, somewhere you can maximize your effectiveness; it will probably make you happier overall."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! And yes!! TSwift is my jam :)
ElementaryTeachers,"To me it sounds like it would be worth looking into other jobs. It‚Äôs great that you have good admin, but with the other factors you mentioned it doesn‚Äôt seem like your current position is the best fit for you. With how hard teaching is these days, it‚Äôs going to be in your interest to be choosy and find a job that‚Äôs right for you. Side note - I love your username!"
ElementaryTeachers,"You're right, get out NOW!  I've been in a similar situation, where then I almost ended up getting fired because the principal literally just bowed down to what any parent said."
ElementaryTeachers,I have- you can message me privately if you'd like!
ElementaryTeachers,"A few of our staff members started as Fellows and did multiple rounds, but try asking this on our Facebook page, you'll probably get more responses: https://www.facebook.com/TALMAadmissions."
ElementaryTeachers,Anyone know someone who‚Äôs done this before?
ElementaryTeachers,"sure, i can fill it out"
ElementaryTeachers,If you‚Äôre a teacher in a catholic school you should be more concerned about the lies and bullshit the kids are exposed to daily from catholic teaching than what they use for a diversion. How can you live with yourself being apart of organized child abuse?
ElementaryTeachers,"Dear families, digits/toys/etc must remain at home unless I have a note from the students doctor"
ElementaryTeachers,Hygienist!
ElementaryTeachers,"Students have to change themselves if they have an extra change of clothes, which I put in my back to school letter. If it‚Äôs poop, parents need to come and get them, shower them and then they can return."
ElementaryTeachers,"If the need for them isn't specified in an IEP/504, you can bar fidget items from being brought to class. But if it is considered an official accommodation, you can't do much about it."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for the advice!

Interesting, I‚Äôve never thought about children being worried about their teacher ‚Äústealing‚Äù their stuff. Will keep that in mind."
ElementaryTeachers,"I give them an opportunity to put it away at the beginning of my class. (Elementary resource). I remind them the first few weeks, after that, it's on them to remember to put it away or set it off to the side at the beginning of class. As with most/all distracting stuff like that my rule is ""I see it, I take it"" Even if they put it back in their pocket quick. I always give it back at the end of class unless they are a repeat offender. Best advice I can give you is to not say anything when you take it. Just put your hand out. They know what you want, so don't give them a chance to argue/talk back.

If you are working in a low-income school, or with a student who does not have a lot of material goods, it helps to put the item where they can see it. Like direct line of sight. Kids get worried about teachers ""stealing"" stuff (even though we obviously won't because why would I want this old fidget spinner), but when they don't have a lot, it matters. For other schools, I just put wherever on the nearest shelf and they get it at the end of class."
ElementaryTeachers,"This use to be a really big issue at my school. Parts of our carpet are really shaggy so oftentimes the carpet would have to be ripped up and replaced due to frequent accidents. Eventually this started to become costly for the school so action needed to be taken. After a lot of deliberation, a group of teachers came up with an idea that has been effective thus far. All of the students in the school were subsequently expelled so there was no one left to pee on the carpet. I teach to an empty classroom and make full salary. In recent weeks the stench of urine and carpet stains has slowly returned. I fear for my safety."
ElementaryTeachers,You can tell them as much as you feel comfortable. Maybe focus on what you love about the community. It‚Äôs the school‚Äôs job to create a smooth transition. Not yours. But I understand that you‚Äôre deeply invested and it feels cold to walk away.
ElementaryTeachers,This is a working condition issue that should be attended to by your union!
ElementaryTeachers,"I think the first step is acknowledgment, and then giving the kids space to talk about it. Ensure them they are loved. SEL SEL SEL!"
ElementaryTeachers,"You will get summers off, and weeks of vacation each school year. Yes you can leave work at work, but you have less flexibility in your schedule."
ElementaryTeachers,Read Van De Walle! It‚Äôs amazing!
ElementaryTeachers,I would recommend not paying out of pocket for grad credits esp if the district you‚Äôre working for will cover the cost!
ElementaryTeachers,All grad level credits should count! Usually school districts provide PD funds so you can take classes that will help you increase your place on the salary schedule.
ElementaryTeachers,"No homework. I gave out homework books that came with our curriculum materials for kids who want them, and provide online resource links for review/extension on my weekly update letter. I don‚Äôt provide extra work to kids."
ElementaryTeachers,"Shakespeare-Bot, thou hast been voted most annoying bot on Reddit. I am exhorting all mods to ban thee and thy useless rhetoric so that we shall not be blotted with thy presence any longer."
ElementaryTeachers,"If 't be true thou art in an area whither thee has't speakers of other languages, prithee forget not those folk

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
ElementaryTeachers,"If you are in an area where you have speakers of other languages, please don't forget them."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I experienced this same problem last week! No clean clothes, no contact with the family, like what in the world can you do?"
ElementaryTeachers,"At my public school in Virginia, preschoolers with no change of clothes sit in the nurse's office and wait while the nurse calls the family and asks them to bring in clothes. I don't think school staff are allowed to help them change clothes. All my kids keep a change of clothes in the classroom but one day last week a student wet themself 3 times so we ran out of clean clothes for them and they refused to wear clothes that didn't belong to them. (Our school keeps extra used, clean clothes in the nurse's office.)"
ElementaryTeachers,She said they pretty much do the same as you. Not a lot they can do short of wrapping the kids in a blanket
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you =o) If you're a teacher, I would be interested in seeing what your kids came up with if you give 1st graders some 4th grader words to spell"
ElementaryTeachers,The district should try organizing a clothing drive and reach out to nearby communities for help gathering clothes for young kids. We have parents and local retail businesses who help make sure our nurses have extra sets for our littles.
ElementaryTeachers,"That would be great! The ISD itself doesn't have very much money so unfortunately they're not able to keep a lot of clothing on hand. Part of what is adding difficulty is they send them to the nurse's office but if the clothes are completely soiled and there's nothing in the child's size and the parents aren't answering the phone there seems to be a bit of a loss of what to do next. The child end up waiting several hours wearing soiled clothes in the nurse's office and missing a lot of school and there's not much the nurse can do without having clean clothes for the child to change into. There were also complaints in the front office from the employees working in there as to the smell when a child does wait in there. The problem is is that even the older kindergarten children don't seem to really know how to clean up properly on their own with instruction only. Nobody is allowed to go in there and assist them and getting cleaned up and changed. It seems to happen really frequently at one of the schools to, with up to seven or eight kids in one day so it's really hard to keep clothes on hand."
ElementaryTeachers,I remember in elementary the school nurse had a dresser where if a child had an accident there were clean undies in a variety of sizes and denim jeans and t shirts. In kindergarten I was already dressing myself and could do the buttons and tie my shoes. Otherwise most kids can put on clothes and may only need help with the buttons and zippers. That was 20 years ago though. Let me wait until morning when my mom is awake and I'll ask her as she's a current kindergarten teacher.
ElementaryTeachers,"I have found my classes enjoy graphic novels. There are so many different topics covered in the books and they entice all readers with the wide variety of topics. This year my class is really into Captain underpants, Dog man, Bad Guys, the Raina Telgemeier series and Roller Girl. There are so many more though then just those over so many topics."
ElementaryTeachers,El Deafo by Cece Bell is a great graphic novel! I studied it in my children‚Äôs lit course during uni :)
ElementaryTeachers,"The Education of Little Tree
Rich Dad, Poor Dad
Hoot
Where the Sidewalk Ends"
ElementaryTeachers,"Where the Mountain Meets The Moon (fiction) and Quest for the Tree Kangaroo (nonfiction) are on my current list of books to buy. But please remember the nonfiction books! So many classroom libraries are heavy with fiction books and I get it, but getting quality nonfiction is just as important!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi. You just mentioned *The Bfg* by Roald Dahl.

I've found an audiobook of that novel on YouTube. You can listen to it here:

ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, it's great you won a grant but you'll blow through that really fast! Here are a few recommendations off the top of my head from a long time 4th and 5th grade teacher:

* Anything from Roald Dahl (The BFG, The Witches, Danny the Champion of the World, etc.)
* Wonder by R.J. Palacio - I use this book to teach reading concepts for Reading Workshop but it also is excellent for teaching social emotional lessons about empathy and kindness.
* Judy Blume books
* I Survived series
* Shiloh, Because of Winn Dixie, Wayside School"
ElementaryTeachers,"Oops, for kids. OK then, ""The Lion and the Bird""."
ElementaryTeachers,"Get the latest Jan Richardson Guided Reading text. Also to get stuff for free, join the FB group Bitmoji Craze for Educators. Good luck!!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"As a parent‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt. The benefits are slim to none and it eats info our family time. If you‚Äôre going to do it, keep it simple"
ElementaryTeachers,"Just reading with parents and suggested counting practice, but never anything of large importance."
ElementaryTeachers,"I do a spiral review for skills we learned in the past!  I also teach math, science and social studies only to 4th grade!"
ElementaryTeachers,Totally would do that (students already have access) but mom wants paper and pencil only
ElementaryTeachers,"If my district didn't require nightly homework, I'd probably only give 30 minutes of reading as homework. Like you, if a parent asks for more homework, I give them links to practice sites such as IXL, Lexia, ClassHero, etc."
ElementaryTeachers,"I do not. 
When parents pressure me for work, I dig out an old textbook and send it home and give them a list of websites we use for practice. I will not do any more than that."
ElementaryTeachers,That's true!
ElementaryTeachers,"This is actually an incredible assignment for people training to be teachers, to find common mistakes and understand the logic behind it. Love it!"
ElementaryTeachers,Ok thank you I‚Äôll have to search some programs and see what it‚Äôs right
ElementaryTeachers,Not exactly. There are a bunch of online programs you can go through where you can work on those credits but it‚Äôs an easier workload and a slower pace than a masters program. Having a masters will help you if you decide to leave your district however
ElementaryTeachers,So it‚Äôs basically saying it‚Äôs a masters program
ElementaryTeachers,"In our district is has to be graduate level course, so everything above the 400 level"
ElementaryTeachers,^^also the games are always deadly serious despite the fact that nobody is keeping score
ElementaryTeachers,3rd recess????
ElementaryTeachers,"At our school, it's kickball. Nobody knows the rules, but everyone knows the other team is cheating."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!! :)
ElementaryTeachers,Can't go wrong with that plan! Best of luck!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes absolutely, how could you not?"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! It‚Äôs been suggested to me to try subbing first. I‚Äôm also thinking about applying to be a teachers aid next school year when my youngest starts kindergarten next year so I don‚Äôt have to find daycare for her. I could try to start subbing now.
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is a looooot more than being with the students, I think people who aren't successful teachers start with the wrong idea. I started subbing as a way to earn money while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I never expected that while substitute teaching (and then assisting in a kindergarten classroom) I would fall in love with the profession, but the two years I spent subbing in schools allowed me to see a lot of what the other teachers were doing and understand that much more is involved with teaching than just being in the room so to speak. It's so much more than liking the age group, definitely takes a certain temperament to both do it well and enjoy it. If you have the flexibility to do so, I definitely recommend testing it out with substitute teaching first before making a significant time and money investment with a degree program."
ElementaryTeachers,I do! I‚Äôm a fan. üòä
ElementaryTeachers,I worked as a para in k years ago and lived it. K is a great age bc the kids are all tacky excited to be at school. They work as hard as they can. They are brutally honest about what they think as well. Is great.
ElementaryTeachers,"Just like another profession. It has positive and negative things. But, it is very fun to interact with children in school."

ElementaryTeachers,Yes but I‚Äôm hearing so much negativity and people retelling by me to not be a teacher.
ElementaryTeachers,I taught kindergarten for years and loved it. Are you thinking of becoming a teacher?
ElementaryTeachers,I have a kindergartner currently and I just love this age and all his little friends and I feel jealous of the teachers.
ElementaryTeachers,"I am an intervention specialist for kindergarten and I love it. I taught preschool for many years and I would love to have my own classroom. I think it is exhausting, but so worth it. I love those little people!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I do, maybe? Haha its better than any other grade in my opinion"
ElementaryTeachers,"I would say Disney's "" Robin Hood"" might be up your alley since it's probably the most pg version of the tale while already catering to kids."

ElementaryTeachers,r/cringetopia users when satire exists
ElementaryTeachers,"Yeah, you'll find this one on r/cringe later though"
ElementaryTeachers,Original
ElementaryTeachers,is this in relation to that one post on r/comedyheaven
ElementaryTeachers,"Idk but all my teachers now, that I am studying are way more competent and you can just tell they are on another level.

Doesn't mean elementary teachers are dumb, but they are on an different educational and intellectual level as a uni prof.

But that's alright. Elementary teachers are still valid."
ElementaryTeachers,Be a dental hygienist. Trust me. I would have gone into any other career if I knew then what I know now.
ElementaryTeachers,stolen
ElementaryTeachers,"I've heard a lot about hygienists having terrible working conditions.  The job itself is in demand so the pay is ok, but you might end up fighting to get benefits and decent scheduling.

Teaching...is great until it sucks.  There's a thousand frustrations and you can't save every kid that's going to end badly.  Any of them really.  Admin is full of shit and will kill your soul.

That said, you do have summers off which is pretty hard to argue with and you aren't spending all day elbow deep in someone's rotten mouth they haven't cleaned in years while getting infected with every nastiness possible in their saliva.  I guess that's not much different from being stuck in poorly ventilated classrooms filled with snot blowing kids who have no idea that hygiene is a concept much less a word.

Teachers at least get some social cred.  Honestly wouldn't choose either profession on purpose but teaching has a number of benefits and I'd probably go that route until getting fired for having an opinion at all."
ElementaryTeachers,Aight bet
ElementaryTeachers,"There are initial sound sorts on Seesaw where kids can practice letter sound knowledge. For example, sorting pictures into B and M piles.  Contrast a taught sound with a new sound.  Don't contrast similar sounds (for example /p/ and /b/) until later.  I also use flashcards held to the screen with visual cues (A for apple, etc). And I screen share letter games from starfall and abcya dot com.  I ask them to think about and feel what their mouth does when they make the sound.  For example /z/ tickles my tongue and /l/ curls your tongue up to the top."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes I use a visual checklist of about 5 things.  After they learn your first most important 5 things, you can add more.  Our school has a system of sending home work on Fridays using school buses, but I'm assuming that's not an option for you.  With the visual checklist, you have to teach and model each item.  Maybe do a modeling lesson and independent practice each day for a week, so that after 5 days, they have seen and practiced each of the 5 items on the writing checklist.  Then the next week bring it all together and show how to use the checklist with all 5 items.  This age tends to like to check boxes regardless of it they should, so it will take practice and feedback about if they actually SHOULD check the box.  Begin every writing time with a mini-lesson of using the checklist on your own story or a student's story.  Have kids work in pairs and use the checklists with each other's stories.  It just takes lots of repetition, time to practice, and feedback."
ElementaryTeachers,"I feel you  u/hoe4tomatoes, same boat in grade 3 here, wish I had a suggestion. Same issues/ plus the parents who pick and choose assignments or contradict directions."
ElementaryTeachers,I feel this deep in my sole
ElementaryTeachers,"Not sure about other schools, but in my district we are hurting for assistants &amp; subs! You would learn more being an assistant. Some schools have requirements for subs (like college credits) but none for assistants."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm a male elementary teacher. 21 years ago when I first started, I wore nice long sleeve button down shirts and slacks. Globs of paint, dozens of whiteboard marker stains, glue marks, and the general uncleanliness of a classroom filled with 30 screaming nine year olds destroyed my pricey shirts and slacks in no time. What do I wear now? Jeans and short sleeved polo shirts."
ElementaryTeachers,"Agreed!  I'm in the same boat and have taught preK-1st. Nobody really seems to notice. If they (adults) care, that's on them.  Many European women don't shave. I don't really want to make some strong feminist statement at work, either, but at 37 years of age, I've decided to do what I want to do.  I think if anyone says anything it will be behind your back.  Again, that's their problem, in my opinion. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I wear sleeveless shirts in the classroom often and don't shave either. I'm kind of in the same boat as you where I personally just don't care to shave. I honestly don't worry too much about the unfairness regarding male teachers. If any of them had an issue with it I would definitely listen to and think on anything they had to say, but I really wouldn't stress about it if no one complained.

I think one thing to take into consideration is the age of your students. I've worked in elementary ed and preschool and have gotten very few questions or comments on it. Whenever I was questioned I just explained to students that 'most adults have hair on their legs/armpits. Some people choose to to shave it off and some people choose not to, it just depends on the person.' Usually that's enough of an explanation for them. If you're in an older grade, though, your experience might be different."

ElementaryTeachers,"Don't forget about the importance of having a steady beat.  I can pick out the weak readers in a class in about 30 seconds because those kids have trouble keep a beat to music.  You're welcome to enjoy my fun, free video that has kids and puppets singing and moving to a steady beat.  Have your kids join along and with practice, they will get better!

ElementaryTeachers,"Please enjoy my free video that has kids and puppets learning about steady beat.  (Steady beat is a critical skill for reading fluency - there's a neurological connection).  With practice it can improve -  [https://bit.ly2qN3KMt](https://bit.ly2qN3KMt)  and I've had lots of success helping kids gain this skill.  I'm a Juilliard grad and a Kennedy Center and Los Angeles Music Center teaching artist - so I actually do know what I'm talking about!

ElementaryTeachers,"I teach elementary art, I love what I do, but there are a lot of things you have to do that aren‚Äôt related to your content area, that you will likely be responsible for. You might not see those types of activities, if you weren‚Äôt working as a teacher for a while."
ElementaryTeachers,Yea I literally have no children in my life &amp; I‚Äôm barely acquaintances with people who do haha
ElementaryTeachers,"To be fair substitute teaching is not exactly the same as having your own classroom, but yes it will give you a glimpse of what the day is like more or less."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you have a child or nephew you can add yourself to the pickup list and start talking to that child‚Äôs teacher after school. If they see ya every day, you might ask to sit in to help your nephew, they might let you. If you keep at it, you could volunteer to prep art lessons or test kids reading skills. Teachers are always desperate for parent volunteers it might be tricky if you‚Äôre not the parent."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you so much those are awesome ideas!!We do take them out as much as possible, it definitely helps!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!! This is what I thought I should do. Appreciate your input!!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm not sure it matters too much. I majored in ECE, took the Praxis in ECE and Elem Ed. so I‚Äôm dual certified. I started off in 1st grade but I‚Äôm currently teaching 4th. You‚Äôll get a job wherever there is an opening or your principal will put you in the grade they think you‚Äôre best suited for. I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm not sure how much space you have, but you could set up a few stations and ask the kids to rotate through during their downtime in the day, or switch the station daily. 

I immediately thought of an art station. You can check out pinterest and find lots of ideas, you could change up the project every few days, but you could start with fall themed projects such as painting a tree with fall colors using aluminum foil, cutting a pumpkin and shapes to make their own jack-o-lantern, etc. You‚Äôd need to make a completed version to use as a model when instructing the kids on how to go about making their project.

You could also add in a station where they practice tracing the alphabet, numbers, and their name using their finger on a sensory bag by putting shaving cream or some gel in a plastic bag and taping the closure shut. I‚Äôd also recommend taping a piece of construction paper to the back of the bag for contrast so they can see the letter formation better. You could also have them make their own bag during an art station, and they could add food coloring or glitter. 

If the center has some cd-players, you might be able to get some audiobooks from the library for the kids to listen to. As new readers, sometimes they get tired of the same early-reader format books, and they can listen to an audiobook while following along and looking at the pictures.

Otherwise, if you can take them outside and let them play and get some fresh air in the downtime before it gets too cold do it!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely become a sub. Being a teacher is hard work, and a lot of people get into it for the wrong reasons. Make sure your reasons are right before you dive into a new program."
ElementaryTeachers,"I second this. Being a sub is what made me realize that teaching was my dream job. I‚Äôm also an artist, and now I‚Äôm an elementary art teacher. It‚Äôs amazing and I wouldn‚Äôt have known how much I would like it without subbing. I also learned A LOT about classroom management, incentivizing, and just interacting with kids from subbing. Plus it really counts in your favor as experience when you‚Äôre applying and interviewing for teaching jobs because administrators know how hard it is to get and keep a good sub, and how challenging subbing is. Subbing is also a great way to get your foot in the door in a school or district that you like. You can try out a bunch of different schools, find one or more that you really like and become a regular sub there. I know several teachers who got their jobs because they were subs first and when a position opened, the school thought of them and helped them get a temporary license to teach while finishing up any education classes they might need to complete a full license."
ElementaryTeachers,"Become a substitute teacher! The process is pretty easy. Whatever school district you live in, contact the district office and they should have information. In my district you just have to pass a general education test called the CBEST and get a general background check. Perfect way to test out different age ranges and subjects. I thought I wanted to work with high schoolers before I started substitute teaching, and quickly changed my mind to middle school and younger."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you want to test the waters, volunteer at a local library or become a tutor. You could probably even come into a school and read to kids but you‚Äôll need to see what the requirements are for that (i.e. background check)"
ElementaryTeachers,"No sadly, my state does pk-3 for ece and 2-6 for elementary."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! That makes me feel so nice. I dont start my edu classes until spring semester so this is all new to me. Thank you for the kind words!
ElementaryTeachers,"In my state the Elementary Education certification program covers grade pre-k through grade 6, and early childhood cover pre-k and kindergarten, but I‚Äôm not quite sure if that information translates to the state you live in."
ElementaryTeachers,The best thing about being the teacher is that you know what you're going to teach so you can review before you teach it so you'll be better than you think. If you put your mind to it you can do it.
ElementaryTeachers,"Very true, I definitely know my preference can change since I dont have experience in this field yet. I guess I'm just very nervous about the testing portion or having to teach higher levels of math because I'm so nervous about my own test level on that alone lol that I'm afraid I'll be a bad teacher in that area."
ElementaryTeachers,"Very true, but does an elementary ed degree cover ece if I'm only certified in grades 2-6?"
ElementaryTeachers,"If you do Elem. Education, at least you have an option to work with any grade EC-6 that you might like, whereas with ECE you are somewhat stuck with very early grade levels. Just food for thought, considering you might change your preference for grade level as your career goes on :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"2-6, finding a job in the grades that do not test are going to be really hard. I am k-6 and having more options to choose from is the best opportunity. Take your base classes first so if you want to switch you won't have to redo much and try to get into classrooms before you decide 100% but, 2-6 gives you more of an opportunity and you may find you love a higher grade you never know!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I think it would be cool to try to find some ways to play board games online with each other, if thats possible!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, I am actually a student teacher right now in Texas. Also in my last semester before I graduate! I am also a very shy person and it takes a lot to get to know me, but just a simple hi or nod goes a long way!

I think if you are only going to be there for a day... just ask questions, and try to assist the teacher with whatever you can! I am sure teachers will not make you do much knowing you are just going to be there for a day. Just do what makes you comfortable. 

Break/lunchtimes can be pretty awkward and the teachers will just stare at you like ""who are you?"" I think just saying hi once again will help, or the teacher you are with will usually introduce you. (at least I would hope so) Just take everything in and have fun. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,They will until SafeTube gets/got hacked and ruins hours of your work. RIP good clean fun.
ElementaryTeachers,"Positive reinforcement 

Incentives - can be simple and free if it is something unique and with someone they love. Like going to the park to draw animals.

Visual schedules and checklists- the checklist chunk up work that seems too intimidating, and schedules help enforce rules without you being the bad guy. ""The schedules says ______""

Also consistency and routine. Unwanted behaviors should have consequences and good behaviors should be rewarded."
ElementaryTeachers,"Kids are physically coming to the daycare. My main job has been to attempt to keep kids on task on tablets with their teachers. There have been some distractions that we are slowly dealing with, such as schools providing tablets but not headsets, so many kids came to class and had to work on speaker with their zoom classes while next to other kids with the same setup. The main issue I‚Äôve been having is that kids see a tablet as a reward system where they can watch and do what they want, and not as a learning tool."
ElementaryTeachers,"Maybe you could recommend educational YouTube videos for them to watch or create your own videos and post them on youtube. And then have virtual meetings with the students less often.
You could also reach out to the parents and try to get them more involved in their kids education. Invite the parents on the zoom call."
ElementaryTeachers,"Cool, thanks!!! Looks great. Going to add it to my list of reading resources for virtual learning üëçüèº"
ElementaryTeachers,"I really like canvas- but only because I limit myself to using only the features I need... I‚Äôve learned a few things well and ignore the rest.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

ElementaryTeachers,How are you liking Canvas? And what are you using for video calls? We‚Äôre using BigBlueButton and I HATE IT.
ElementaryTeachers,Yes!!! Now send plant pics :)
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh my gosh- stop. Totally made my day, I have so many plants and couldn‚Äôt think of what to use that I wouldn‚Äôt have to buy- and since I have no need for a cart for each table group- I‚Äôm bring them home! 
Thank you!!"
ElementaryTeachers,I love you both
ElementaryTeachers,Love your carts. Got mine at Lowe‚Äôs for my plants. Great investment.
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks! Just a few cords and a few phone calls to my dad! ü§£ü•¥ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ElementaryTeachers,Jealous of your 3 screen setup!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, the first year is usually about surviving. Lower your expectations.  Just like you said, college preps you for what is best--ideal lesson plans, backward mapping, etc.  In real life, it's a lot of behavior management, diplomacy with adults (parents and coworkers), and never having enough time.  The most unexpected things happen almost everyday."
ElementaryTeachers,"The first time I was in charge of a class (1st graders) I was shaking and broke out in full body sweats.  Afterward, I went to the bathroom and cried! I was so surprised that my body reacted that way. I didn't think I would be so nervous with 24 six year-olds. After that first time I was much better! So maybe being super nervous in the beginning is somewhat common?  (I don't know-I have anxiety too! But I'm also in my 8th year teaching primary grades. Don't let original experiences and fears scare you away.)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm about to do my student teaching and am in my credential program. These are some words that one of my professors shared with me that made me feel better. He said there are levels to the classroom. He said it's okay not to be perfect your first year. It might be that you are just surviving. You're not doing the hands on lessons you'd like, it's not interactive enough,etc. But the next year you improve and the year after that you improve. It okay not to be perfect just don't stop improving. That made me feel a lot better. Also remember these classes are structured to give you what is best not what is always the reality so you have to keep that in mind."
ElementaryTeachers,"&gt; Am I actually put off or is this just my anxiety talking? 

yes it is. And its a good thing. Showing that you think so much about it shows that you care about the students. And especially elementary students need someone to care about them.

The first time i stood in front of a class i was scared s\*\*\*less and screwed up majorly. Its important now for you to take time, learn about what you want to do, and get ready for when the time actually comes."
ElementaryTeachers,"I taught for part of the time for two semesters, and at the end of my senior year I was student teaching for the entirety, until my University had finals week. My last week was the week before finals week. The first placement I had was kindergarten, the second placement was fourth grade, and my final placement was first grade. I really enjoyed kindergarten. That woman was like a mother hen to all of those kids, and me. We had a lot of fun.

I taught at a VERY rural title one school. There were 14 kids in that kindergarten class, which was perfect. I don‚Äôt even think their student body topped 400. 

Fourth grade was a nightmare due to the teachers I was with. They had a grade level team of 5, and the kids were divided so some rotated between 3 teachers and the others rotated between 2 teachers. My mentor teacher was a part of the three-way rotation. She and her colleagues were very rude. One had the audacity to ask me, ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre cut out for this?‚Äù with a giant smile on her face. It was bad. When the year started, they divided the children based on standardized test scores. There was a high, middle, and low class. This was poor planning, because all of the children with IEPs ended up in the low group and it was difficult to teach. This experience put a bad taste in my mouth for upper grades.

I requested to do my final semester of student teaching in first grade because the teacher was, well, amazing. Plus a couple of the kids I had in kinder were now in her room. My request was granted, and I got along swimmingly with that teacher. It made me feel like I was meant for first grade. She taught me so much more than any course I took. She also loved her kids. 

All the while I taught these grades, I also student taught in special education because my university wanted everyone to have dual certification. I completed the requirements and all, but I never took the sped praxis. Idk if I still can, but it‚Äôs not something I want to pursue. I enjoyed my time in sped with the kids, but there is no way I‚Äôd want to deal with their paperwork and the legalities of it. 

I started my third year teaching on Sept. 1. I taught second grade for two years but this year I‚Äôm teaching fifth grade reading. I teach at a magnet school that was a National Blue Ribbon School in 2019. 

I am thankful for my experiences, but I am more happy with my current grade level."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi in my 8th year teaching now but I'll never forget the student teaching experience I had, I'm Dadüë®"
ElementaryTeachers,"Agreed that the hardest part of student teaching is working so hard for zero dollars.  I did student teaching in a 1st grade classroom in Virginia.  I was with the class for 12 weeks and also got a long-term sub job after the student teaching ended. I learned so much. Behavior management is arguably the trickiest part of teaching.  You get lots of good practice being in control (or pretending to be in control lol). The main thing I didn't practice that is a tricky part of the job is parent communication.  My lead teacher did most of the communicating, but that might be different for you.  I'm in my 8th year teaching now but I'll never forget the student teaching experience I had."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm student teaching right now. I LOVE it. I love my host teacher. I love the faculty. I love the team. I got very lucky. I have a long term sub position lined up in the same grade this winter and I‚Äôm hoping to get a permanent position in the fall! I am teaching about 1/4 of the time and will move to full time teaching for a consecutive 2 weeks in the next bit. I haven‚Äôt had to create lesson plans quite yet but will be making some for observations. The lesson plans are already laid out from the host teacher- so I just have to follow those and make them more of my own when I teach. The district/school usually follow multiple curriculums that have lesson plans already- they don‚Äôt teach that in our college courses. Haha. My supervisor does 6 observations during the 12 week period- Im bit worried about them, they do those to help us become better teachers.  I am a mom of 4 kids ages 5 and under. I‚Äôve been a stay at home mom for 3 years so that has been a HUGE adjustment. And the cost of childcare is ridiculous. It‚Äôs difficult working a full time job and getting zero paychecks. But other than that, it‚Äôs been SO good. I‚Äôm so exhausted. Everything else in my life is falling apart a bit. But I‚Äôm proud of myself for making it this far. Good luck to you!"

It will automatically put the presentstion in present mode and all edits will be live. I created links on each of the bins to link to the lesson plan for the week. Students cannot edit the file themselves. It's just a way of sharing content. :-)"
ElementaryTeachers,Anyone use any of these resources? I know I should check them out on my own but there‚Äôs just too much on my plate already. I‚Äôd love to hear how you used them and with which grade level. Thanks :)
ElementaryTeachers,"You need to go through a credential program. In that program you'll have to student-teach.

You also have to take the RICA and CSET (different than the CBEST) The CSET is comprised of 3 different tests. 

Oh and during your credential program you have to do the CAL TPA which is also a test but you're teaching and then submitting a video of you teaching along with a lot of other stuff you have to write out. It's not difficult but a looootttt of work. Good luck."
ElementaryTeachers,"You will have to disclose it, but they really are concerned if you have any charges involving minors"
ElementaryTeachers,Our school is preparing for a part 2 pandemic... and our k-2 is using seesaw. So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs easier than google classroom at that age.
ElementaryTeachers,Love go noodle!!! Best brain break ever!
ElementaryTeachers,"It does work but if you are using zoom, I recommend having them have their cams on so you know they aren‚Äôt using something else to cheat. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Find something she likes. I had a student who we would draw something together. They would only get a piece of the drawing if they completed a small part. For example we would draw a smiley face. One problem or one sentence give you an eye, another problem the nose  etc....

You can also create a weekly chart, if she does her work 3/5 days you will play a game of her choosing on the weekend. When she gets good at 3, up it to 4. Etc....

Also, letting them brag or pointing out their accomplishments helps. Have her share with someone via phone or in person that she read passage or did her work by herself. 

Also, possibly speak with her teacher if you can about working together. 

Best of luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"A lot of times what worked with my own kids was complimenting them as they did their work, giving them praises ‚Äúwow good job‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing so much better‚Äù it‚Äôs a process, but it goes a long way in making the assignments that much more enjoyable for them. 
If your sister just refuses to do it a lot, then I might advise talking to your mother about making her work for her privileges in the house: games, tv time, whatever she enjoys to do- because clearly she wants to do something else. 
And then once she starts doing it, shower that princess with some love. Kids thrive when they are given words of encouragement."
ElementaryTeachers,"One of my favorite supplies (can be used for any grade) is a set of dry erase boards to show answers. If you can‚Äôt afford those I got a set of plastic sleeves you can put papers in for a cheaper set. Nothing like a quick check to see answers!

I also love a container for each group cluster where you can put a set of makers, crayons, scissors, whatever you fancy in them. May not work during covid times though"
ElementaryTeachers,Such a good resource!
ElementaryTeachers,"I could definitely see that! I think it depends on the group of kids and which videos. They have a lot of mindfulness videos and we tend to do those ones before assessments. Popseeko and all Koo Koo Kangaroo I use for body breaks (sometimes replacing our activity in morning meeting.) I think the other big factor is that my 3rd and 4th graders definitely feel too cool to jump around singing with me, but eventually I get them there and it‚Äôs a good time. I‚Äôll put on a Just Dance YouTube video if I want us to be completely silly. For distance learning, I‚Äôm peppering in GoNoodle to give kids a break - whether they choose to move their body with the video or go grab a snack from the kitchen. Also, on the rare occasion we get too silly with GoNoodle, I just turn it off and say ‚ÄúOur bodies were unsafe. We will finish this video with safe bodies after X.‚Äù"

Kurzgesagt also makes good educational videos as well although, I do not believe that they are as organized as Crash Course.

I just discovered PBS Learning Media as we were going into remote learning and so I havent really had the chance to use it live in class. 

I also intend on trying to use Khan Academy during parts of my in person whole class lessons this year. I want to see how that goes."
ElementaryTeachers,Can you tell me why? I use it when my kids are waiting for the buss but its really an after thought for me. I find that if I try to use it during the day my students get too hyper and unfocused afterwards.

Most teachers(speaking as a Texas teach) don't get their students again as they move on to the next grade and given you won't have a norm reference since we didn't see our new students last year. Most teachers are not tech savvy, so I would recommend scour Facebook groups for educators and look for SPED(TAG TOO)  teachers. Elementary it is sped from K-2 and 3-5. So those SPED teachers see those students again. Most will be weary of posting so ask for anonymous emails to so and so email or anything to keep anonymity. You will find friends on groups labeled ""do not reopen school"" or ""safely reopen schools"". Good luck"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I saw your google app that you also have. How do you use it? Do you just put it on google classroom as a link, or is there a way to incorporate it into your virtual classroom? I love the K-5 boxes you have under the bookshelf. Can I make each one a clickable link that brings me to your classroom app? Is there a way to restrict which students have access to each bin/class, so students aren‚Äôt going into other grade levels and messing with things?"
ElementaryTeachers,"My sister did that program. She‚Äôs currently at an elementary school and says it was a good program.
Edit:sfsu"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm currently looking at the degree requirements and it looks like the concentration will actually go through maths/sciences/etc, which is nice to see. I didn‚Äôt really consider looking at the degree requirements so thank you for that!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I think my biggest concern is the coursework. I‚Äôm in the bay and SFSU does offer CHAD: school age child, but the lower-level coursework is all ECE work. I‚Äôm worried that it won‚Äôt prepare me well enough for testing and teaching material. Not 100% sure how college works lol"
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt know about the colleges in your area but Cal State University Fullerton has Child and Adolescent Development major, and you can specifically focus on elementary education after majoring in CHAD"
ElementaryTeachers,Ok. Ive been checking out SeeSaw and it really looks like something to utilize.
ElementaryTeachers,"My students have Chromebooks, so the touch mouse won't be an issue. I'm not sure if you can embed Seesaw into GClassroom, but you can add the link to GClassroom and will take students to their personal account."
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach 2nd grade. My grade level team and I used Seesaw for all instruction, aside from Google Meet for morning meetung. Seesaw is extremely user friendly for the age group. I would use Seesaw for center work and kids picked it up extremely quickly. They ended up showing me a few tricks (Isn't that always the case?). 

From the teacher side, you may having a learning curve, but you'll pick it up easily too. My peer is not technological at all and she picked it up in a week. If you become an ambassador, ypu'll have free access to more resources. Hope this helps and great luck this year!"
ElementaryTeachers,Yes. If my school uses google classroom (all grade levels K-5 are mandatorily using it) can SeeSaw be used through google classroom or is a one or the other type thing? Also is it easy for students to use SeeSaw with a touch mouse on their chromebook? They won‚Äôt have touch tablets or anything. Just the finger pad on chromebook. Thanks.
ElementaryTeachers,"I used Seesaw in the spring for remote learning. I don't have the app on my phone so I'm unable to view the activity, but students will be able to color and draw in Seesaw when they respond to the activity. I hope this helps somewhat!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you to everyone that submitted! This survey is now closed. Please look for an email from PicScience (check spam/junk folder) throughout the day to receive more information on prizes.

ElementaryTeachers,"The fact that you‚Äôre asking is a great sign. Someone who has a positive attitude, is open to feedback, reliable, on time, and a self-starter. Someone who is flexible and able to learn new things. Someone who just truly enjoys working with kids and helping them grow. Also, communication is key."
ElementaryTeachers,"Someone who works well with students, is motivated, happy, talks to students at their level, has students engaged, follows instructions easily, is on time, finds ideas to help the students on their own, and communicates well with the teacher with any achievements or challenges they have with the students. 

The key is what is the assistant doing to help the student achieve and meet their goals. An assistant is not my personal assistant or secretary. They must be willing to help a student learn and show growth."
ElementaryTeachers,Mom has been a music teacher for 20+ years and she has created these fun dances and activities to help kids during the school day. I convinced her to film them but we sincerely hope they help your classroom during these crazy times.
ElementaryTeachers,Done ‚úîÔ∏è
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"The best thing I could find for you is this from TPT:

[https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Canadian-Money-Distance-Learning-Google-Slides-PowerPoint-Digital-Math-Game-5383458](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Canadian-Money-Distance-Learning-Google-Slides-PowerPoint-Digital-Math-Game-5383458)

Looks like it includes a game that does and does not include pennies. Doesn't have students returning change, but the denomination values seem to go rather high.

Maybe ask the seller if they could make what you're looking for?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Could you show them using a number line before they work with the cash? 
I hope someone with other suggestions offers them soon! Best of luck !"
ElementaryTeachers,"To be abit more clear, I‚Äôm teaching them in a cafe where they are actively serving customers. So one of their biggest issues is rounding up and down to return change. I can‚Äôt have them practicing with pennies because we do not have pennies in our system. This is a life skills and employability program."
ElementaryTeachers,"My recommendation would be to use the penny because it corresponds nicely to number place values. Focus on one math concept at time, are the students learning to subtract decimal numbers from whole values? If so, teach with the penny. If the math focus is on rounding, teach the students just that. By breaking the math concepts up, you are working within students‚Äô working memory potential and not overloading them with concepts being more accessible for all learners."
ElementaryTeachers,"Flexibility is huge when teaching, and that includes what grade level you can teach.
Depending on what state you live in, if 2nd grade is the highest you want to go, an early childhood degree might be more appropriate for you.
When I was considering teaching, I got a job as a teacher's aide and then substituted while I was in college. I know that is not financially feasible for everyone, but it really helped me solidify what I wanted to do. (I also was convinced I needed first or second grade, but after getting into more classrooms, I realized I loved upper elementary, and that's been what I've done ever since. Sometimes you surprise yourself.)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, you need to thrive on emailing, administrative work, being open to changing your entire ethos every two years, jargon, bandwagoning, group work, office politics, trends, business-like approaches to education, flexibility to the point of nihilism, and being on the go constantly. If this doesn't jive with an already-overactive amygdala, don't do it. 

Also, teaching is less teaching and more being under-qualified but expected to perform in the following areas all at once:

* Curriculum design
* OT
* Speech
* Neuropsych
* Counselor (parents)
* Counselor (students) 
* Special Ed/Inclusion/Exceptionalities expert
* Social worker
* Therapist (SEL, mindfulness)
* Secretary
* Graphic designer
* Facilitator
* Academic
* Babysitter

Note that teacher is not on the list."
ElementaryTeachers,"One thing that a professor told our class that really stood out to me was this : ‚Äúif you are sort of wanting to be a teacher, please do not become a teacher. We have enough mediocre teachers in this world‚Äù
.
.
I don‚Äôt say this to bring you down or crush your dreams at all, but being a teacher is so much more than just giving lessons and having a Pinterest worthy classroom. You‚Äôre given the opportunity to shape little minds and have a huge influence on the way students learn about themselves and their relationships with students of other cultures. I have social anxiety myself with adults, but I am absolutely outgoing with younger kids because they are just so judgment-free and we feed off of each other‚Äôs energy. Also, when you are hired for a job, you don‚Äôt get to pick what grade you teach. Like the previous commenter mentioned, you have to be flexible, especially with the younger wiggly ones. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Some things to consider when becoming a teacher:

Are you okay with flexibility? Moving grade levels, taking in feedback, having plan b/c/d when things don't work out?

Are you able to set clear, concise boundaries? Create rules, discipline, schedules that students can follow and stick with?

Are you able to utilize and interpret data and incorporate it into your lessons to best meet student Needs?

Are you able to collaborate with a small group of teachers and share ideas?

Do you understand that you could (possibly) work past contract hours, and are you okay with that? I say possibly because many are able to work within the timeframe but I have never been good at it.

There's plenty more, but just some things to think about."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm teaching remote 2nd graders in a district where 99% of the kids are going face to face. My students are becoming VERY knowledgeable in technology. Way more so than the in person learners. My personal children are F2F and my students are far more capable in using the district provided programs (Seesaw, Canvas, Google, Lexia, IXL, Brainpop/Brainpop Jr./classlink and then a few others that I have them work in like padlet, flipgrid, boom cards, freckles, and typing.com). 

Also, they are learning to use mouses, typing, recording videos, taking pictures, blogging! F2F learners at my school are not doing all of this. They're also troubleshooting their technology pretty frequently too! I've got my LMS set up so that the kids can be 100% independent as well. Unless they don't understand the content, the parents are reporting that the kids are doing it all essentially by themselves. 

One parent messaged me saying that their children's independence, time management, self-motivation, and confidence have risen exponentially from where they were at the beginning of this year (they have 5 children, 4 in school, 3 of them are mine [they are triplets]). He said that he feels like his kids' study habits will be so advanced, that they won't struggle like he did as a student. 

There are SO many negatives about remote learning. There is so much complaining, and it sucks in a lot of ways. But I choose to focus on the positives. I'm seeing a ton of growth in my kids that do the work. I'm giving them all of me, to make sure they have fun, make connections, and are ready for 3rd grade. And I'm really proud of them and the work I'm doing, especially since I'm 1/10 remote teachers in a district with around 1200 teachers and don't have much support or community."
ElementaryTeachers,Please check out- Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach a student who has always identified as female (since he arrived in prep), prefers to be called  Queen Elsa.  His family are completely against it and refuse to budge.  His peers are very accepting, however, they really hate hearing the songs from Frozen.  I walk a very fine line of his identity (and yes he is fine with he and boy at this stage) and what his family expect.  He is desperate for long hair but his family buzz cut his hair.  He wants to wear dresses.  I have put in an ""imaginative play"" area in my middle school classroom to allow him to express himself and **all** the other students dress as princesses and play along (wigs, dresses, high heels, wands, capes, wings, masks, etc).  It is joyful to see how all the students just accept that it is his identity choice.  I imagine in the future there may be some discussion about pronoun choices and identity but we will face them when they come.  I will advocate for Queen Elsa until he leaves me for high school and I know his peers also have his back."
ElementaryTeachers,"I knew of a male student while he was k-2nd grade and he only wore girls‚Äô clothes to school. ‚Äîand I‚Äôm talking sequins and tutus, not just dresses. For the most part, everyone was totally cool with it. I don‚Äôt think he knew what trans or crossdressing ir genderfluid might mean, which I believe is a good thing at such a young age. I think it was good he didn‚Äôt have a label for himself yet. Kids would often ask him why he wore girls clothes or if he was a girl or a boy and he‚Äôd answer confidently that he was ‚Äúa boy who liked to wear girls clothes and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.‚Äù Kids would accept his answer  and move on with whatever game they were playing. 
I would occasionally hear some remarks from the older teachers saying they disagreed with his clothing choices or would say ‚Äúwho really knows who they are in first grade... etc‚Äù in the staff room, but never says anything offensive to him or any other parents/students and were protective if him as any other child in their class.

I think as long as it‚Äôs not a big deal and you raise him to be confident about it it‚Äôll be fine. 

That being said, this child I knew was definitely acting on his own interests and his folks were along for the ride. He told me he hated boys clothes and wanted to be a girls‚Äô fashion designer when we grew up. If your child is being pushed into this, I think it‚Äôs worth a talk with your coparent about providing a wider range of clothing options."
ElementaryTeachers,I believe he was steered in this direction but it was at such an early age but it is him making these decisions now. It‚Äôs just that the seed was planted veryyy early
ElementaryTeachers,"I once had a student (6 yr old boy, kindergarten) that would love to get his nails painted and wear girls shoes. He was such a bright and energetic little boy! Loved having him in class and I loved that he didn't care what other people thought. He used to get so excited to tell me that he went to the nail salon or to check out his new pink shoes. This is just the way he was. Some kids found it odd, but majority of them barely noticed. This was just who he was. I think he'll be ok and as long as you support him and let him know that you love him no matter how he chooses to express himself he'll be ok."
ElementaryTeachers,"You say he is just starting elementary school. That‚Äôs pretty young! At that age, students are often meeting people diverse from themselves (of all types) for the very first time. I think children at this age are a lot more accepting and understanding than we give them credit for. I would probably talk to his teacher in advance and have a conversation about his transition to elementary school. 

I personally would let him wear what he wants, contrary to other posters. If he does get negative reactions from others and decides to stop, thats ok too, but he needs to know regardless of other kids reactions, he can trust his parents to support him. (just my opinion)"
ElementaryTeachers,"This is very tough. Personally as a LGBT+ educator, I would be totally open to having to having a student like that because I trust that I could handle it in regards to educating students and parents about inclusion and more progressive gender roles. My district would be very okay with this too.

However, I would bet that this is not the norm. This is something I would talk to the school administration about to see if they are really willing to put the effort in necessary to create a safe and affirming environment for your son."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think you should keep the dresses and make up for play at home.. Students that young will question him and probably call him a girl, other kids will probably tell their parents that he wears dresses and what they relay back to him at school not be so kind, he may not respond well to that or be traumatized at such a young age. If I were you, I‚Äôd keep it to the dyed hair and do the other things at school when he can properly speak for himself.. that‚Äôs just my opinion though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,"I've seen variations of these types of behavior management charts used before. An experience that made me rethink these types of charts was when students would immediately  tell their parents after school which students in class had their clips on the ""bad zones"". I'm talking about right outside the classroom with dozens of classmates and parents around them. Must have been so humiliating and embarrasiing for the behaviorally challenged students and their parents but I guess that's the ""logical consequence"" for undesirable behavior?"
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Wahoo!  Glad I could help!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!! This is exactly it!!!! My childhood mystery has finally been solved!!
ElementaryTeachers,Carson DeLosa?
ElementaryTeachers,"These were everywhere when I was a kid, and I always wondered where they came from."
ElementaryTeachers,Done!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm also a sub but going to school to become a teacher, and in my district they are very adamant about everyone using them I personally don‚Äôt like the shame part of it, the kids are always devastated to clip down and it always makes me feel so bad"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! That means a lot!!
ElementaryTeachers,That's amazing! You seem like a really amazing caring teacher! :)))
ElementaryTeachers,Note: for Americans.
ElementaryTeachers,"@starraven question for you as a software developer ‚Äî My undergrad major was initially elementary ed + a dual major. I got cold feet right before my student teaching year (this was 2 years ago, before covid) and graduated with the dual major. Now I‚Äôm doing an online computer science program and I like it a lot. but I‚Äôm thinking about teaching again, in light of the recent US election and feeling like I want to make a difference with the next generation. What made you decide to switch to software development? Do you feel like you still have as much of an impact?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I appreciate the opinion!
I have students reading on their individual levels so the struggling readers are actually higher on the chart. 
The students lower on the chart are students who are choosing different activities during the week because they do not enjoy independent reading yet. I am hoping this will motivate the students a little to help them pick up a book."
ElementaryTeachers,"while a good idea, i feel that competition when it comes to completion is not the way to go. especially as public as this.  students with learning disorders and difficult home situations might feel inferior over something they cannot control. Maybe having personal charts for students may work better? this is all just opinion though!!!"
ElementaryTeachers,no.
ElementaryTeachers,Aww thanks!  It wouldn't let me make it longer.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much for your help! I love your username btw my favorite saying is progress over perfection
ElementaryTeachers,It depends on where you live.  Some places only require a high school diploma and some require more.  Just look up a nearby district.
ElementaryTeachers,Right on! You did the right thing
ElementaryTeachers,Proud of you!
ElementaryTeachers,"Both of my home school-esque students have attention disorders and behavioral issues so I am used to those outburts and issues. Also yes it is ALOT of collaboration, I have to give daily and weekly progress reports to soooi many people."
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching entails LOTS of behavior management. Also more collaboration with adults--coworkers, parents, admin--than I thought."
ElementaryTeachers,"I can only imagine the difference between substituting and being the regular teacher based off how it went at my schools! What type of education is required to start substituting? I dont have any Education degrees, all of my tutoring has been word of mouth and I got my current jobs because of how long I had been tutoring"
ElementaryTeachers,"Ok.  Sounds like you lesson plan and grade, so it will just be the additional numbers and classroom management.  I think the idea of substituting might help you get a feel for if you like the numbers or not.  However, don't judge teaching on subbing because that is a different beast!  Sounds like you might enjoy it!  Good luck with your decision üôÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yeah that makes sense, luckily I am only at an associates level so I can make the change if I decide without losing a lot of time so to speak. I have worked most K-8 with some 9-12 and I definitely prefer working with the K-6 as well! Luckily with my students and everything with covid I have gotten to really pick up a home school teacher level roll with my current students (god bless their families for caring) so I kind of get to see what creating lesson plans and all of that is like."
ElementaryTeachers,So nowadays I am a supplemental teacher for science and math at Sylvan learning centers and I am a private tutor/teacher doing almost 100% home schooling for a 7th grader and a first grader. I create lesson plans and supplemental materials for both and do grading outside of what their schools provide (very minimal feedback which my students do not find helpful). I have done this for K-8 students for all core classes and specific electives if I have the knowledge for it.
ElementaryTeachers,"I've never tutored professionally, but I'm thinking there is probably a lot more prep and grading as a teacher.  

My first year teaching it was easy to work 60-70 hours a week.  I took 14 years off to raise my kids, but came back this year (of all years).  I work between 45-50 hours this year.  The hope is to work closer to contact hours next year.

I think to give you better info, I'd need to understand what your tutoring entails.  What do you do now?"
ElementaryTeachers,"This is why I put off going to graduate school until I could substitute teach for a while. That's obviously been a little different because of covid, but in the past two years I've been in grades K-12 and realized the 1-6 program is where I want to be. The program I'm applying to puts you in a classroom for the majority of its duration, so in person experience is a huge part of the education."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, agreed wholeheartedly! I‚Äôm so happy that your light is lit. Mine too. I love teaching elementary students. I know it‚Äôs not for everyone, and it is a challenging job, but it‚Äôs worth it, for me. I was in a rough mood this morning and my kids turned it around for me with their love and enthusiasm. And their bizarre sense of humor.
‚ÄúWhat do you get when you mix a blue crayon with an orange crayon?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing. Just some crayons.‚Äù"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yep 2 bedroom apartment living with my mother in law, all my shit is in the trunk of my car."
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs a little more complicated than that. It was a combination of stress and having a tiny apartment and needing the space.
ElementaryTeachers,"Damn. As a former elementary teacher, I‚Äôve been a software developer for 2 years and I still haven‚Äôt donated my classroom books, pocket charts, and manipulatives. You should really consider another job if you were that miserable."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for the suggestion, I‚Äôll definitely add it to the list!"
ElementaryTeachers,Reaching and Teaching Students in Poverty by Paul Gorski is a very informative book for all teachers imo. It was required reading for one of my education classes a few semester ago
ElementaryTeachers,[Find it here!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T11ZQKH)
ElementaryTeachers,You might also want to take a look at ClassHero.
ElementaryTeachers,"IXL.com is wonderful for that! Organized by grade level and standard/ skill. It‚Äôs free for the simple version but if you want to use it often and track your student‚Äôs progress, worth a subscription!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks a lot!!!... I will check it out and give it a try .
ElementaryTeachers,There are schools in the us that have ‚Äúspecials‚Äù which are single subject teachers that stay in a classroom but have students move in and out like a high school but for elementary. You should try to find one and do that.
ElementaryTeachers,"My thought is that Middle School might be right for you.  I can't stand the kids in middle or high school and so I'm in elementary.  However, if you are still in the schooling stage, you may get a better feel as you go along.  They should have you going into classes and working with students.  Maybe your state does a 1-8 certificate?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm currently a 5th grade elementary teacher and if I could do it all again - I would teach one subject in early middle school. I was also a history major and would love to get to focus and refine my craft by having one curriculum rather than 5. Elementary teachers are just so overworked and under-compensated. For the reasons you mentioned, I think sticking with a subject matter you‚Äôre passionate about will outweigh the age of the students."
ElementaryTeachers,"(I'm in the US) lot's of universities seem to offer programs where you get that subject certification, and an elementary certification at the same time. At my university they actually encourage doubling up to broaden your skill set. So I don't see any reason why you couldn't do both? You could even find yourself in a small school where you teach an elementary classroom and a section of middle school social studies or something along those lines. Having both the certifications would make you more desirable to hire as well

I'm a K-12 music education student in Michigan for reference."
ElementaryTeachers,"They wouldn‚Äôt allow gum in a 504 plan? That‚Äôs kinda silly. I like that idea though. I‚Äôve never heard of that before. If the situation ever arises and I have a student like that, I‚Äôll suggest it.

He‚Äôs not a service dog. My principal allows teachers to bring their animals. There are about 5 of us that do it sometimes. I used him as a classroom reward when I taught second grade. Now that we‚Äôre teaching f2f and virtual, I can‚Äôt bring him. There are too many laptops and chargers in my room; he‚Äôd snatch one off of a table almost instantly. This past week we didn‚Äôt have any f2f learners per the superintendent. They come back tomorrow though, and then we continue the hybrid learning. 

And thanks! He really enjoys school. It was my goal last year to train him to be a Canine Good Citizen but COVID happened, and now I don‚Äôt have the extra money to spend. It would make me feel better if he was trained lol. None of the dogs that come to school have been trained, but I was hoping to do that to just have him prepared for all situations."
ElementaryTeachers,"I don't think my school would ever have a service dog.  I tried to have gum in my daughter's 504 plan because she was suicidal and it can give you a new sensation to focus on.  They said something about gum not being allowed even in special circumstances.

What a cute boy by the way!"
ElementaryTeachers,"&gt;and they‚Äôre miserable and contribute to the negativity of the profession.

I actually just resigned from a support role that works with students. I had too many coworkers that fit this description. When HR wanted to know why I was leaving, I explained to them that I see too many people with their ""light"" burnt out. It made it harder on other coworkers, the students, and the parents.  Everyone has their own style, but Elementary students want to be engaged and taught! For me, it would be fulfilling, but that's for each person to decide.

My light is still lit and I can help be the positive side. Back to college to become a teacher!"
ElementaryTeachers,Awesome!!! He‚Äôs my only Dane. He‚Äôs a good boy.
ElementaryTeachers,hey! I‚Äôm a future teacher who also owns Great Danes!
ElementaryTeachers,"I think it‚Äôs fulfilling, if you really do love working with children and seeing and understanding those moments where kids are just kids. Today I was teaching a science lesson and the kids were excited about it and were trying to understand what I was talking about and I felt so much joy. This year has been a tough year regarding covid but also working with those kids have been my saving grace. I‚Äôve never wondered if I gone into the wrong career.  I most say though, you need to like children which is obvious but also have a willingness to understand them and build a connection even when you don‚Äôt like them. Most days I‚Äôm excited to go to work. But it is a lot of work and effort that a majority of the time goes unnoticed, which is fine with me  but is not for everyone.

Also regarding salary, teachers all over the United States are underpaid but I teach in NYS and I find it reasonable and livable. (Thank go for the teachers union) I can pay my bills and still have enough for some extra things I want. 

I will say if you are unsure, see if you can volunteer in a classroom. (This year might be hard)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I am a 4th grade teacher and as depressing as this year has been/is, I still find it rewarding. Just don't start until Covid is settled and things go more back to normal. Virtual learning does not work well for children and the workload is at least triple what a normal year is."
ElementaryTeachers,You should try to be as sure as possible about making this choice. You need to really love kids and have a great sense of humor and patience.
ElementaryTeachers,"I find it very fulfilling and the pay and benefits are good, in my opinion. You‚Äôll hear a lot of people who are dissatisfied and unfulfilled but that‚Äôs going to be in every career, plus it‚Äôs very popular to complain about teaching pay and teaching workload. I‚Äôm an elementary art teacher, so my experience is a bit different from a normal classroom teacher, in some ways much better and in some ways more complicated. (It balances out honestly.)
Anyway, if you‚Äôre passionate about teaching and want stability, enjoy having a routine but are flexible, and you enjoy being around children, teaching is absolutely amazing. There are way too many people who only do it because they don‚Äôt know what else to do, or they aren‚Äôt flexible, and they‚Äôre miserable and contribute to the negativity of the profession. 
I absolutely love my job and after working tons of crap, unfulfilling, low paying, meaningless jobs, I know for sure that this is the career for me. I don‚Äôt know if that helps but that‚Äôs my 2 cents. ^.^"
ElementaryTeachers,"Just a guess but I wouldn't be surprised you and the other three were moved to the GT class because there was no room in the regular classes. To save money by not having to hire another teacher, they probably found four high achieving but not necessarily ""gifted"" students that they felt would be able to handle the GT class."
ElementaryTeachers,"Nice, upvoted"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,"We use google classroom. I started to make videos for my distance learning students. I am special education teacher. My kids love the videos. 

https://youtu.be/O2bNLgv9n90"
ElementaryTeachers,"In the winter when it got too cold, I took them to the gym with balls and toys etc. and let them just run and yell as much as they wanted :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'd love to give them time on the playground! You say you gave them an hour every day, did you fo this during the winter? How did it work with the colder weather?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm an after school care teacher and I second the theme idea! We do a different theme every week and activities based on that, and the kids LOVE the themes and it helps them engage in different interests"
ElementaryTeachers,"I can't believe I didn't think of play dough! Multiple activities is definitely something I'd like to incorporate, but so many of my ideas are depending on the kids, I just can't wait to get to know them üíõ Thanks for the advice!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm an after school teacher for kids who are all online currently, so I‚Äôm actually with them all day long not just after school. I find that having ‚Äústations‚Äù with different activities at each one (and we repeat them certain days, we don‚Äôt find 4 brand new activities everyday for new stations). I‚Äôm in a classroom with k-2nd grade and we will have watercolors at one, magnitiles at another, legos, coloring books, slime making, play dough, etc... have three or four activities going at once and a teacher (if possible) at each spot. If possible give the activities relevant themes like ‚Äúcolors‚Äù or ‚Äúanimals‚Äù and try to guide their creativity (I.e. theme is animals, so we will make elephants with the play dough). 

I find that variety, theme, and flexible guidance and direction go a long way for a classroom full of kids that are absolutely DONE with online school. I hope this helps! And good luck, you‚Äôre going to fall in love with your kids :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Schoology.
Google Drive.
Google Slides.
Microsoft Teams.

That‚Äôs it."
ElementaryTeachers,"All of the academic apps I use are supplementary in nature. Keep in mind that the majority of the apps are 4th grade math focused  since my grade level team teaches (I teach all three classes math). 

IXL - math practice - I like this program since it can match the adopted math program used in my district using ""skill plans"". 

XtraMath - math fact practice (mostly multiplication facts). I like this app since it tracks what facts students know well and which ones they need to practice. It also shows the students the answer if they get it incorrect and makes them type in the correct answer which helps them memorize the facts faster. 

ClassHero - Math practice but this also allows the students to choose an achievement and earn ""badges"" which are like trading cards with famous scientists on them. It's also easy to assign math topics that match the unit where currently studying.

Whooo's Reading - Great way for kids to track their daily reading and also respond to their reading through providing feedback. The app automatically checks their writing and encourages them to add more detail and though as well as correct and spelling, punctuation, and grammar. The three classes are competing to see which class can have the most reading minutes and writing entries each month.

Quizziz - fun game based way to review content. Kids enjoy it since it looks and works similarly to a video game. It's similar to Kahoot! but I think it's better, especially since it's easier to implement over Zoom.

Those are the few that I could think of off the top of my head."
ElementaryTeachers,"My grades 1-6 elementary school (we didn't have public Kindergarten yet) was structured like this. Students spent half the day with one teacher who taught reading, grammar, &amp; pelling and the other half with another teacher who taught math, science, and social studies.   This was from 1979 to 1985. I thought it worked great."
ElementaryTeachers,"This!  But middle school is 6th grade here where I am.
The only ones that had 3 teachers were kids who went off they were ESL kids or had learning disabilities like me to get taught the same thing but modified for them."
ElementaryTeachers,"They do this in ny, gotta have those ‚Äúspecials‚Äù"
ElementaryTeachers,"We do that a lot here in Texas already. A lot of elementary schools do 3rd grade-6th grade with one teacher that does math and science and one that does language arts and social studies. Some even do three way splits- a math teacher, a Lang arts teacher, and a sci/SS teacher. I have even done it in first grade where I taught 2 subjects and the other teacher taught 2 subjects because one of us was teaching in Spanish and the other in English. I prefer it that way because then it‚Äôs a lot less to plan and prepare for. The only disadvantage is then you have more students in that you have 2 classes, so more to grade. But it‚Äôs worth it."
ElementaryTeachers,"This maybe an unpopular opinion but enjoy teaching all subjects. At my last school we had two teachers per grade level. One planned reading and social studies and the other math and science. This broke up the work load and we got to focus on our strengths. It was still collaborative and we incorporated our own style even if we didn‚Äôt plan that subject. At another school we taught all subjects and had little to no collaboration. It was pretty awful. 

It was unfortunate the year I was placed with another teacher that was also stronger in reading and social studies. We were able to work together on the math and science plans but I would have been uncomfortable being responsible for 50 kids learning math and science all year. Having only my class of 25 gave me more time to focus on those teaching strategies and I think it made me a more effective and well rounded teacher in the long run."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I can easily do the others like screen and spring, just got stuck on ‚Äú5 cartsüòÑ‚Äù"
ElementaryTeachers,"You are right, it‚Äôs her task instead of mine. I just got so fun that I didn‚Äôt know what was the answer, kinda doubt myself a little bit!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I agree that ""shrink"" is most logical, but first graders may need support for that one. It's confusing a lot of us teachers so it might be more of a challenge to littles."
ElementaryTeachers,"You should actually leave it wrong or empty so the teacher can correct it for your child. The goal of these seesaw tasks is not to get all right answers, it's for the student to demonstrate their knowledge so the teacher knows what to teach and follow up on."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm proud because our job is so important and impactful!
ElementaryTeachers,"I think it‚Äôs Shrink, thank you for answering me and"
ElementaryTeachers,Ok I guess y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt proud
ElementaryTeachers,"Preferably parents! However if you‚Äôre a teacher of a certain grade and you feel like you have good info, I absolutely wouldn‚Äôt turn it away! Sorry for the confusion."
ElementaryTeachers,"So you do not want the responses filled out by an elementary teacher, only parents?"
ElementaryTeachers,Good point! I would say to select three or four times a week and then you can leave that as a note in one of the fill in the blank questions and we‚Äôll take it into account. Thank you for taking the time to do the survey!!
ElementaryTeachers,What if our child only gets the school lunch twice a month? I don't see that as an option.
ElementaryTeachers,"This makes sense, especially when teaching arrays as rows and columns. It relates to area"

ElementaryTeachers,"If your focus is on building those important relationships, I think you‚Äôll be able to do that in both. I think if an SLP chimes in on this post, they‚Äôd be able tell us more about it. But as a general Ed teacher you do get to build all the relationship building structures, which is exciting and fun (hard, too, like everything. For me at least haha!).

Gen ed teachers should be co-teaching and planning with their ELD teachers in the best case scenario. Additionally, gen ed teachers should be implementing structures that support ELs in their classroom, as well as SPED supports. Those structures support all learners! So you can totally do all the things you want as a gen ed teacher! But, you won‚Äôt be able to focus as intensely on individuals, like you would as an SLP."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! Thanks for your post. I shadowed SLPs in various focuses. I think it may thinking of grade school because SLPs only receive 30 minutes with a kiddo from my experience. I find it difficult to really build a connection with the students. One SLP I shadowed says she uses the time to pick up her kids, go outside and visit kids during recess. That way she gets some time. But for some reason a part of me isn‚Äôt completely satisfied because I‚Äôd assume conversations are very surface level. I wasn‚Äôt gonna tell her that though. 

I think I‚Äôm classrooms you‚Äôre able to build more rapport. I guess the main reason why I liked SLP was because I enjoyed building language barriers. Teachers in grade school can also teach ELD too though. Idk"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I‚Äôm currently in a elementary teacher residency, and our program is almost finished, so the most experience I have had has been working as a co teacher everyday in a Title I school. I‚Äôll be starting as a general education teacher in my own classroom at the beginning of the next school year.

I decided to become a general education teacher because I wanted to work with large groups on academics, SEL, and create inclusive classroom environments that promote students critical thinking, self reflection, and their care for peers and the larger community (not any different than other general education teachers, I‚Äôm sure! üòä)

However, I couldn‚Äôt do my job without dedicated interventionists, counselors, SPED teachers, and other educational roles in the school (like SLPs!). From my experience, their ability to build a relationship with students is vital to helping students who may feel marginalized in the general education classroom because of the barriers you talk about. Plus, schools need SLPs and interventionists in the school community. They are a vital part of serving students.

What is it that is making you interested in being in the classroom as a gen-ed lead? 

I agree with the post above. Spend some time in a classroom (whenever that is available again, ahh!), observe the workload and the details of the job, and have fun with the kids! Reflect on how it feels to be in that space."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, Elementary teacher here! If you have the ability, I would recommend going in and shadowing for a bit with an elementary teacher and an SLP. Spend a couple days with each to see what their job looks like and the daily grind per say. Everyone here can give their experience, but when it comes to your job/career, you really need to experience it for yourself for a bit! As an elementary teacher, I absolutely love my job &amp; think it‚Äôs the best fit for me. In this wild time of the world, it may be hard to get into a classroom but that would really give you the best idea of if it would be your ‚Äúbest fit‚Äù too!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Is this what you're looking for?

ElementaryTeachers,"Check out Schoolgirlstyle.com. Tons of theme ideas. Or just have a color scheme you stick with for a unified look. Black and brights, white and brights, pastels...etc. But School Girl Style is the best place for ideas!"
ElementaryTeachers,"When I got my second grade classroom, the previous teacher had left her entire theme in the room. It was owls. I was like okay cool I‚Äôll roll with this. I changed it a year later (this year) to something that I liked: orcas. I had to make all of my decor myself, but I am incredibly proud of it and my students LOVE it! They wave to my giant stuffed orca that‚Äôs hanging from the ceiling, they love gazing at the bubble fountain, and the orca mousepads really make them feel special when they‚Äôre using my computers. It‚Äôs still a work in progress, but I love it and so do they. Pick an animal that you like and some colors associated with it. When I picked orcas, I decided my colors would be shades of blue, black, and white. It worked beautifully."
ElementaryTeachers,Strongly disagree.
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm going to disagree with this. It is your work environment. You will be spending a lot of time there. Make it pleasing to you. However, maybe focus on a theme that fits your personality instead of what you believe others will like."
ElementaryTeachers,"Don‚Äôt have a theme, the only people who notice it are the other teachers, not the kids. Don‚Äôt waste your time/money."
ElementaryTeachers,Check out cool math for kids they have an interactive site.
ElementaryTeachers,Will do! Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Checkout Seesaw
ElementaryTeachers,"You‚Äôre welcome. I really enjoy Flipgrid. 

Getepic.com is a free website until June 30. I‚Äôve assigned books for my kids to read based on the content they would be learning right now."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for your reply. I've too been pushing a sense of just trying to get all families engaged, before moving to real eLearning, and using those efforts as an understanding in how to engage asany famlies as possible."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôs highly suggest Google Classroom. My district plans to use this if they decide to not let us return on April 6.

In the meantime, I‚Äôve been using an app called FlipGrid to create topic videos for my students. I haven‚Äôt posted any videos that are academic, but more just to build a sense of classroom community while we can‚Äôt see each other face to face. The kids reply to the topic video with more videos, and then other kids can reply and see everyone‚Äôs videos and replies. I‚Äôve asked questions like what made you happy today, what‚Äôs a talent that you have, and create art using nontraditional art materials. It‚Äôs been pretty fun."
ElementaryTeachers,"The parts covered by v√©rtice lines are the left half and the part covered by horizontal lines are the bottom two thirds, so the part covered by both vertocle and horizontal is the bottom left two sixths, which is also the product of the two fractions"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm still confused.. what do you mean by shaded
ElementaryTeachers,"It shows A, 1/2x2/3 because the left half is shaded and the bottom two thirds are shaded which results in the answer, two sixths, being shaded"
ElementaryTeachers,"First I would decide where you would like to go. Google teacher preparation programs near me. See where that gets you. You can also call these colleges and speak with a guidance counselor or career advisor. They would be able to point you in the right direction. My best piece of advice though, should you choose to do this, is to make sure you have a specialized degree. Reading speciaIist, speech, math coach... I am a classroom teacher in the states and I am looking for a way out. Teaching has gotten to be extremely difficult so i would caution you to consider this carefully. Not trying to discourage you, but i can guarantee that what you think teaching is and what it actually is are very different. Good luck."
ElementaryTeachers,"I feared interviews for quite some time and actually had a panic attack during my first interview into the college of education. My best advice is to gain confidence in your strengths as an educator. Know yourself and let everyone know how great you are. Compliment the person who spoke before you. Say I agree with so and so, but I would like to add whatever. Most interviews in my state are conducted as a group where you take turns speaking. I also practiced interviews with other colleagues and students while in the program. We had practice questions and answers we created that we did over and over. The best advice is to practice and do as many interviews as you can. It is the best way to get over the anxiety!"
ElementaryTeachers,It's professional credit hours in Hawaii too.
ElementaryTeachers,I see.
ElementaryTeachers,I was correcting my statement that it seemed like a slightly high starting salary for a Bachelor's. It's average. I'm in Massachusetts for reference.
ElementaryTeachers,"In VA the 30,45,60 were professional credit hours. It was a way to motivate staff to attend more PD through out their career."
ElementaryTeachers,I don‚Äôt understand what you are correcting. I am graduating from a California state university with my credential in multiple subject.
ElementaryTeachers,Correcting my initial response: that might be slightly on the low side. But if the school you're applying to has a supportive administration (and decent benefits) it could be worth it. Which state are you in?
ElementaryTeachers,Thx for the feedback. Will make updates
ElementaryTeachers,"You‚Äôre referring to the $50,644 as the first pay rate? It is for bachelors."
ElementaryTeachers,"The experience column is the number of years you've been employed in the system. If this is a public school, and you switch school districte, this should carry over. Not sure about private. The degree refers to either a Bachelor's or a Master, with +30 being the number of graduate credits you've accumulated towards a second (or third) degree. If the first pay rate is for a Bachelor's, it's pretty high, which is why I suspect it's for a Master's, in which case it's average or low depending on the state you're in. Look up average wage in your district, and good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm from Spain. The degree itself is not useless, there is always something you can use that you've learnt in your years at university, but it's a 10% maximum. We all feel like we don't know how to teach after finishing uni and when starting working we feel that we have wasted four years of our life because at the end we tend to teach the traditional way because we don't know what else to do. 

At least this is how I'm feeling now. I'm working as a support teacher just one hour helping students with homework and creating activities or games for them to review their subjects and I feel that I don't know what would I do to really teach them if I were their main teacher.

Other huge problem that I find is dealing with bad behaviour. Despite is not my weakest ""aspect"" I struggle sometimes in making pupils listen to me or follow my indications, not to mention I'm learning how to resolve problems between pupils on my own because, again, I feel uni was a waste of time.

I'm sorry if I sound pessimistic but that is why I'm asking for help here, because I want to do my work right  and also I want to enjoy my work not to find it so frustrating because if this stays this way I'm not sure I would be able not to burn out when I really start working as a full-time teacher."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm not learning anything new yet, that's why I ask you here. Any advise?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Nice idea but I'd make the green box smaller, (is it even necessary?) and the ""hear word"" button less intrusive. Could it just be a small icon instead? Then I'd make the word to be read bigger. At the moment it gets lost among the other stuff."
ElementaryTeachers,"Where are you training?
Where do you plan to teach?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm curious what country you are in, as teaching degrees in the states are required, and not considered useless, you don‚Äôt end up teaching. 

Either way, I agree on several points and would recommend you look into Trauma Informed Practices, and strategies for culturally responsive teaching."
ElementaryTeachers,Second read works for fiction/nonfiction passages. Getepic books for reading and engagement.
ElementaryTeachers,Pinterest has some good resources. PIE is life for anchor charts.
ElementaryTeachers,"Glow night black light night. 

Carnival with games food and activities."
ElementaryTeachers,"My best free whole curriculum resource is San Francisco Unified Core Curriculum for math. 

[SFUSD Math Core Curriculum](http://www.sfusdmath.org/the-sfusd-math-core-curriculum.html)"
ElementaryTeachers,Okay this makes sense! Thank you for your reply!!
ElementaryTeachers,Agree!!
ElementaryTeachers,In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Just be sure to get certified for both. I graduated with a degree in ECE and took the praxis (the teacher certification exam for NJ) for ECE and elementary Ed. I taught 1st and 2nd grade for the first six years of my career and then got moved to 4th. Admin will put you where they want to regardless of the degree.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm 16 years in and I have this conversation with myself almost every year! I love love love to teach, but all the outside factors, politics, lack of funds, lack of respect- it can really bog you down. Some things that helped me are: 
1. Find a good therapist!! 
2. Set firm boundaries to keep school and home separate. When I first started teaching, I‚Äôd go in super early every day, stay late, go in on the weekends, answer emails in the evening. Now, I don‚Äôt check my email once I get home, even on the weekends. I only go in on the weekends once a month. And I plan one late night a week to catch up on everything. It was really uncomfortable at first, and I had serious teacher FOMO when all my friends would be in on the weekend together. But the more consistent I am with this, and the more I can really unplug from the job and be present with my family, the more recharged I feel the next day for school. (Btw, my therapist really walked me through this whole process)

I also think there is no shame is saying goodbye! I‚Äôve almost done it multiple times! Some other jobs to consider are Montessori teaching, instructional coach, school librarian, online teaching, or even trying another grade level to mix it up. I also got certified as a yoga teacher and I do that on the side, but I could turn it into a full time thing, if I ever decide to take the plunge! Keep your options open, and know that as a teacher, you have so many invaluable skills and would be an asset in many other fields!"
ElementaryTeachers,Sent ya a dm
ElementaryTeachers,You could possibly have a video of you teaching to show your style as well as have children give testimony of you as a teacher.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for this info!! Since this post I have decided on Catapult Extravaganza. We're getting University engineering students to build the catapult. Flinging watermelons, tennis balls, rubber duckies.. we're going to weigh everything and measure how far things go. They're even bringing 2 springs they can change out so the kids can discover which spring makes things go farther. Tight or loose. I'm setting up several game type stations where kids can build or play with things that will introduce the principles of trajectory, force and levers. The engineering Reddit sub has been incredibly helpful. 

The event is in April, so hopefully it all works out. Thank you for the info. I'm sure we can use it for other events!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, this is what I see on a daily basis in my third grade classroom"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, this is what I see on a daily basis in my third grade classroom"
ElementaryTeachers,"STEM night would be good. I feel like sometimes the cost of tech kits for a school can be high, so def price check them out. A list of STEM kits can be found here- https://jellybeanrubbermulch.com/2020/02/13/ultimate-guide-to-science-stem-kits-for-elementary-classrooms-featuring-600-products/"
ElementaryTeachers,"Can affirm this is common now. In the US you cant just be a teacher. You also have to be their parent, psychologist, doctor, and sometimes feed them. There are a lot of needs not being met at home or elsewhere."
ElementaryTeachers,Normal behavior? No. Does it happen all the time? Yup.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, we would very much like to here from specialists at this level. Thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,Specialists at this grade level? I looks like only ‚Äúhome room‚Äù teachers.
ElementaryTeachers,Our social emotional curriculum has puppets that the students love. We act out scenarios and strategies with them and the students love them so much.
ElementaryTeachers,Lysol spray and a steam cleaner. I steam the tables and chairs when I know I‚Äôve had an I‚Äôll student.
ElementaryTeachers,"I taught 9-12 grade for 13 years and this is my 7th teaching PK-6. 

I surprised myself with how much I liked it. I am much more tired at the end of the day. The younger kids are so much more emotionally present. 

I find it more rewarding in a day to day way."
ElementaryTeachers,"Pro: you get to shape the future 
Con: you get condescending responses when ppl ask what you do."
ElementaryTeachers,Do you have a program in mind that will get you certified?  With a psych bachelor's you will likely need a lot more classes.
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh, brilliant! Thank you so much. I‚Äôll let her know when I see her tonight."
ElementaryTeachers,You could have them interview/ profile each other about something like ‚Äúdinner‚Äù and explore all the different places/ foods/ contexts people eat dinner. A concrete and simple focus can help you really see and appreciate differences.
ElementaryTeachers,Nursing all the way. Wish I could go back and do it differently.
ElementaryTeachers,"If I were you I would go the nursing route. Education is getting more and more challenging. We are being asked to compete with more and more but we are not given the resources or time. We are told what to teach, when, how, with what... There's very little autonomy. It's also become very customer service like. Pleasing parents is key and parents often don't want to hear about how their child did something wrong. The pay is awful most places. Become a nurse and then be a school nurse? As a nurse you'll always have a job."
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt remember a lot, but I do remember modular origami, drawing Celtic knots, creating a fraction/decimal Memory game (example lesson to the rest of the class) and going into a 2nd grade classroom to do a lesson on doubling. 

Our teacher really tried to give us hands on experiences in different areas. The moral of the story seemed to be that there‚Äôs more to teaching math than textbooks and lectures."
ElementaryTeachers,"I do! For every family that gets me anything other than a card. I figure they don't have to get their kid's teacher a personal present and it shouldn't be ""expected"" so I do make a point to."
ElementaryTeachers,"I had the same fears of interviews when I first got out of school. Just take some breaths and know that your knowledge will come through. Here are some examples of questions I was asked from numerous districts. 

-Why do you want to work for us or this district?
-What qualities do you feel you would bring to the team?
-What would a typical day look like in your classroom?(referring to schedule)
-What is your educational philosophy?
-What would your discipline plan look like?
-If I was to walk into tour classroom on the first day, what would I see?
-Please tell one example of how you have hand to deal with conflict between students, and what was the outcome? (This question can also be asked in regards to parents, staff to staff,etc.)

These are just some examples. A good tool I used was having my family ask me the questions or even or acting in the mirror. 

Good luck :)"
ElementaryTeachers,I write thank you notes anytime one of my students or colleagues gives me any sort of gift. I just bought a box of blank cards that are good for all year.
ElementaryTeachers,I always write thank you notes no matter the time of year if what I receive is more than just a card.
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely depends on the school culture and the principal! I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to teach at a school that doesn‚Äôt allow tattoos as I feel that‚Äôs discriminatory. 

I‚Äôve worked at 5 schools and none of them had a policy about tattoos, piercings, hair color, etc. for staff."
ElementaryTeachers,I have a couple of tattoos on my arms and have never had any administrators mention them. But it does depend on the district!
ElementaryTeachers,I know it depends on the district rules and the school you are at (:
ElementaryTeachers,I know 2-3 kindergarten teachers that have tattoos. I think it depends on the principal you have.
ElementaryTeachers,"I work on crafts for myself and my home. I am currently learning to sew because that has always been a bit of a challenge for me, but I‚Äôm excited! It relaxing to create!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I believe it depends on what state you‚Äôre in. Some places you have to have the minimum of a bachelor. Other places might require a masters. Basically with your associates you can substitute, be a teachers aid, etc."
ElementaryTeachers,"So you‚Äôd need your teaching license and the proper education. I can‚Äôt speak on your states requirements. But I was under the impression you needed more education.. the school would easily answer that. Also, early childhood and elementary are not necessarily the same. There are early childhood programs and elementary Ed programs.. really think about what age groups you‚Äôre interested in! Younger children (pre-k/k) is a lot of dealing with emotions and behaviors. They‚Äôre pretty much learning how to be a student. Something I know people have struggled with once they start"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, by all means!  We usually went in as a grade level team to buy lunch for the administration group."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! I‚Äôll look into that!
ElementaryTeachers,The Cult of Pedagogy is a great one!!
ElementaryTeachers,Pack your patience. Seriously. And never assume they know something.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much this has really helped me that I really do want to do this am future career.
ElementaryTeachers,"I think the biggest thing would be ready to being with behavior constantly. Like I mentioned before, it could be the first time for a lot of these kiddos and as adults it‚Äôs hard to wrap our brain around that. It can sometimes be difficult to ‚Äúteach‚Äù in the typical way. It may feel like you can‚Äôt teach academics because you‚Äôre correcting/teaching behavior. At that age, that‚Äôs reality and can feel really frustrating for teacher you may like activities to go as planned. I‚Äôve heard a lot of teachers say they can‚Äôt work with younger children because it feels much like babysitting. I personally see it as helping children learn how to be little humans so they can have a strong foundation as they continue to grow in their education and life. But I could see how it may not feel that way for others. 

Lessons need to be a lot shorter. If you‚Äôre the kind of teacher that really likes to dig into things, you may feel like you‚Äôre running out of time before the children start lose interest. Or not be able to plan our complex or what you may consider more fun activities.

Other thing to look at is the impact early childhood education has on children‚Äôs life.  ECE is still growing but the research doesn‚Äôt lie, children need intervention earlier! If your passion is in education then maybe that can be some positive motivation :)"
ElementaryTeachers,I work with younger kids a good amount so I kind of understand how they learn. What would you suggest looking into before deciding to go to college for teaching younger kids? And thank you for replying to my question.
ElementaryTeachers,"Can I ask the last time you worked with younger children? 

I would say you have to do a lot more explicit teaching. You never really wanna assume what students know ever but at these younger ages that‚Äôs especially true. Teaching specific behaviors and expectations. How to be a student at the school (walking, quiet in the halls, ect.). Lots of social emotional work and some academics that you‚Äôd expect. 

I just think it‚Äôs important to remember that kindergartner could be the very first time some kids are in a formal/structured environment for long periods of time. I think you have to be really mindful, compassionate, and full of patiences in this grade level. The most basic of skills aren‚Äôt easy the first time doing it!"
ElementaryTeachers,I would recommend reporting this incident to whomever is a higher up or the school board.
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôd love this for my first graders!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! Luckily my state is one of few that pays teachers the highest! That‚Äôs one thing i‚Äôve always feared about teaching (the pay) but if i stay here i could honestly make a good living!
ElementaryTeachers,"I got a little curious after replying to you and looked up teacher pay. Not sure where you‚Äôre from but I‚Äôll take a guess and say somewhere in the US based on your major comment. I‚Äôm in Ontario Canada and here you need to take a post graduate program in education after finishing your Bachelor‚Äôs degree. So here‚Äôs a link to highest paid teachers in the US by region. 

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/elementary-school-teacher/salary"
ElementaryTeachers,Happy to help... and answer any more questions if you have them :)
ElementaryTeachers,I buy and take care of plants. Something about watching things grow (that don‚Äôt talk back to me lol) is very relaxing. Also spend time with my mom and my cat.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey! I just wanted to thank you for your comment! You really hit the nail on the head, I think I‚Äôm comparing myself too much to my classmates and it‚Äôs starting to really get to me. I seriously appreciate your help, and I wish you good luck with your own studies!!!!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! This really made me think &amp; you have so many excellent points.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey there! I don't know if this is the feedback you're necessarily looking for specifically, but I just wanted to let you know that you don't have to compare yourself to your classmates! It sounds like you have a classic case of imposter syndrome. You're in school right now to prepare yourself for a job you're interested in, you don't have to be super experienced right now! I did my undergrad in graphic design, and always felt like my classmates were all so much better, more experienced, and more talented, but now looking back, we were all in it together and had our own unique strengths and weaknesses! 

To actually try to answer your question- you can look for part-time work or volunteer opportunities for kids camps, after school programs, activities. You can also babysit or basically do anything that just gets you more experienced with children! 

I am currently getting my masters in Library Science with a Youth Services Certificate and licensure in hopes to become an elementary art teacher. I know what you mean because I also don't have tons of experience teaching kids or anything like that. But I know those things come with time and everything I'm doing is preparing me for those experiences. I hope this made you feel better! Just try to enjoy learning and don't compare yourself to your peers too much! You're doing great!"
ElementaryTeachers,I used learnzillion for first grade. Think most of it is free if you just create an account. Videos are really great.
ElementaryTeachers,I would also suggest this.
ElementaryTeachers,iReady is what we use. They have physical books and digital resources.
ElementaryTeachers,"Zearn.org is a curriculum that includes both small group time and 1-on-1 screen learning time.

You can definitely follow their lessons without using laptops. They provide small group lesson plans, extra problem worksheets, homework ALL FREE printouts.

It felt like a lot at first but you get the hang of it when you find the flow"
ElementaryTeachers,"I definitely remember their faces, but not always the names. Then like an hour later their name will pop in my head, lol. The very first class I taught (first grade) just graduated high last year. I haven‚Äôt felt the need to Facebook snoop them yet, but it‚Äôs nice to read (good things) about them in the paper."
ElementaryTeachers,I hope it does. I've been with this class since the beginning and I feel like I should be getting this by now.
ElementaryTeachers,Yikes. That's a good point.
ElementaryTeachers,We use GoMath curriculum and you might able to find a workbook on Amazon.
ElementaryTeachers,You‚Äôre doing great- and it gets easier!!‚ù§Ô∏è
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks dear! I'll definitely try that‚ù§Ô∏è
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you buddy
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much buddy. I cannot take my mathematics classes without Geogebra. But I'll definitely check mathigon!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm introverted and it‚Äôs never been a problem in the classroom or with parents. My students like a calm space and that I let them be talkative at times. Just don‚Äôt expect kiddos to be quiet and you‚Äôll be fine! The problems I find with being an introverted teacher are primarily with other staff and their assumptions about me and honestly, feeling like the quiet teachers don‚Äôt get the kudos or accolades. But I‚Äôm ok with that, it‚Äôs just that you have to be aware of that and know it‚Äôs not personal. It feels like high school sometimes and us quiet teachers are like the unpopular kids and sometimes it bugs me. But I know I‚Äôm a great teacher and that I balance things out. I‚Äôm flexible and reflective and quietly do my thing, knowing I do great even if I feel misunderstood sometimes."
ElementaryTeachers,My first academic class was a big fail. My lesson plan fell through so badly. I think I was more overwhelmed than my children. But I really tried to get them to be happy about what they learnt. Even if they learnt one word today I‚Äôll be a happy teacher.
ElementaryTeachers,We are still in virtual school. It‚Äôs hard enough to get them to call. But I‚Äôm making slow progress.
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm going to definitely use this.
ElementaryTeachers,"Been there done that

1.  Look on line at your district's information sheets and contacts for kindergarten enrollment.  Read what they say on the site, but also give them a call.  Discuss your concerns.  The reality is that while districts want $$ that comes from enrollment, they very much want kids who are ready for school  I would imagine that is doubly so this year with the need to focus on learning recovery due to covid disruptions.  You are very far from unique, and they will be able to discuss your situation and lay out what options they have this particular year (again those may be different due to covid recovery stuff).

Again -- being ""bored"" in kindergarten is not a problem.  Being underwater in 7th - 9th grade is a huge problem with serious consequences.

Our son who we held back is a senior this year in college (held back again due to being overseas when covid hit and having to lose a term as Germany's semesters do not mirror up with American semesters.)  He is doing great.  Our daughter who had the 3 friends held back is also doing fine.  She did decently well through high school and played 4 years of college soccer.  She is now in her 2nd year of residency for O/P.  One of the other girls of the 4 also played 4 years of college soccer (must have been that absolutely fantastic kindergarten soccer coach they had) and she is in her 3rd year of Med school.  Another is a newly minted lawyer once she passes the bar exam this summer, and the last is a neo-natal RN.  Would they have been the same if they had moved ahead?  Who knows, but they make a pretty good argument for holding back."
ElementaryTeachers,More for herself. Check this out: https://www.teachcreatemotivate.com/teachertoolbox/
ElementaryTeachers,You‚Äôre absolutely right!
ElementaryTeachers,Right?!? I'm also an early elementary teacher and I also can't afford it. But it's soooo cool!!!
ElementaryTeachers,"I think a document camera should be something no teacher has to bring on their own.
After reading in this sub I understand that schools often don't supply the basics but I just hope hers will be different."
ElementaryTeachers,That thing is amazing but I can't afford it. Thanks anyway.
ElementaryTeachers,"(i‚Äôm hoping i‚Äôm understanding you correctly, if not i‚Äôm sorry) 
If you are almost done with your BA, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest switching studies this late you‚Äôll lose most of those credits. Finish the current degree and find an alternative certification program (i think most community colleges have one) or a Masters degree. 
I did Grand Canyon University‚Äôs masters program online while I worked as an aid at my current school and it was a smooth transition to get a full time teaching position here üòä"
ElementaryTeachers,Check out WGU and some others. Some programs offer Masters in elementary teaching (initial licensing) when you have a bachelors in another field.
ElementaryTeachers,Grand Canyon university
ElementaryTeachers,WGU worth checking out
ElementaryTeachers,"The personal laminator is my first suggestion. I‚Äôve taught Kindergarten and second grade recently and used mine often for both grades. I‚Äôve worked in a few different schools and it seems the school laminator is either broken or has no film. Also, I love my paper cutter. I can easily print out task cards, game pieces, or word cards etc. I can cut and laminate then use them over and over again. 
   Good for you for trying so hard to find something useful for her."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for the thoughtful response!  What is a BTDT?  I've not spent any time on this sub.

1. I don't know if my state K does half or full days.  Did you request half days? 

2. The current plan is to repeat PreK (FL pays for one Year of PreK and next would be out of pocket) but it would be so much cheaper to have him repeat K.   Is that something you can request, though?  What if the teacher says he can go ahead and it gets taken out of my hands?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Not a teacher.  BTDT with 2 of 4 kids.

My personal suggestion would be to (1) explore available pre-K options.  If non stand out, then consider sending ahead with the express understanding that he is going to repeat K a second year.  

We did that with 2 of ours with October birthdays and a September 1 cut date.  We obviously kept up on things with the teacher during the year.   It made a huge difference.  The oldest was a girl and she went from a well behaved but a bit behind in academics too a friendly leader.      Once we made the decision we learned that 3 other girl parents from the same school also decided to hold their kids back.  (We still know all the girls well and all did well academically and socially.)

It worked well for our daughter so with the next - son with another October birthday, it was a no brainer.  He did 1/2 day K 1st year and full day K second year. 

The big issue is what happens to young kids when they hit middle school.  Being ahead a bit in K is one hell of a lot better than being behind physically, and in maturity, when you are in middle school.  That is when the costs of starting young are paid.  

The facts are that you cannot tell the future.  But, if you can give a better chance then you do it."
ElementaryTeachers,"A useful timer (programmable kitchen timer will do), pens of various colors, a paper trimmer (Fiskars with a replaceable blade), a small hand sized whit board. These things were useful at any grade."
ElementaryTeachers,A cricut if you have a large budget!
ElementaryTeachers,Don‚Äôt know your budget but a document camera. (Hopefully her school has a projector).
ElementaryTeachers,How about a personalized clipboard and stationary. I got some my first year and still use it.
ElementaryTeachers,Personal laminator is a must!! The school ones are always broken or they don‚Äôt have one
ElementaryTeachers,"I didn't think about that.
I will definitely stick with things that are useful in general to avoid buing things that are already supplied by the school."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'll remember it, thanks.
After the comment underneath I think I will actually wait with things like this that are likely part of the school supplies rather than personal stuff and go for things that are universally useful"
ElementaryTeachers,"Some of my favorites: a set of personal dry erase boards and markers, picture books, containers for kid supplies, mailbox system, bookshelves... Anything organization. First year is hard. Being able to find things will make it easier. Please also wait until she gets in and sees what her school is able to supply. Will she have a budget? Then she can see what she is working with."
ElementaryTeachers,yes like a heavy duty manual staple gun. A smaller one. It makes putting things on the walls much easier!
ElementaryTeachers,"My favorite item I have ever got was a stand up mini whiteboard for a table. On the back also has pockets to hold pencils, whiteboard markers, etc. It is great for small groups!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for the reply. 
Like pencils and stuff to hand out to her class?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Alright yes. That makes a lot of sense to me, thank you.
I can provide any usual tools like hammer and screwdriver but a I added the hot glue gun and I'm currently wondering what kind of stapler you refer to. Is it the kind that doesn't need a bottom plate?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I think it will be a first grade but eventually it is going to be anything from 1st to 4th grade so anything related to the older kids is also fine.
Thanks for the tip I didn't think of that but it immediately made my list."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I second the personal laminator!"
ElementaryTeachers,Personal laminator is a game changer! Also an electric pencil sharpener.
ElementaryTeachers,"She‚Äôs going to need a tool set. I have one with a little hammer, screwdriver, etc. Also an small industrial stapler and a hot glue gun."
ElementaryTeachers,A tool box filled with school supplies!
ElementaryTeachers,"What grade will she be teaching? When I first started out in 1st grade (6-7 yo), I loved my personal laminator. Good luck to your girlfriend!"
ElementaryTeachers,I would be happy to help you come up with a quick mini lesson to teach this if you want. Just message me!
ElementaryTeachers,A behavior chart is a good idea. You can also start teaching how to use ‚ÄúI statements‚Äù. You could do this with everyone and go over expectations for how to play nice together and role play certain situations. Example of an ‚ÄúI statement‚Äù: ‚ÄúI feel ‚Ä¶. When you/because‚Ä¶.‚Äù. You can model this for the students and they will see how to use it. You could also start praising students with rewards if you see/ hear them using the I statements in play with each other. This can help with conflict resolution. A lot of kids might not know how to play well with others and have skills in conflict resolution with peers at this young age‚Ä¶. I statements can help!!
ElementaryTeachers,Show him some social emotional skills I.e. empathy.
ElementaryTeachers,"There‚Äôs no problem with academics as it‚Äôs a non academic summer program. Most of his hitting starts with others not playing a game ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù or the way he wants to. Sometimes it also starts with the younger kids grabbing toys out of his hands. 
I‚Äôve tried to teach him to better communicate (‚Äúspace please,‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how we should play + explanation‚Äù) but it doesn‚Äôt seem to stick. I think it‚Äôs an impulse issue, I need to figure out how to get him to think *before* he acts"
ElementaryTeachers,"All behavior is communication and has an underlying function or cause. There are many questions to ask yourself and the teachers/program leaders. For example: is he having trouble communicating verbally or getting along with peers or problem solving? Is he struggling academically and frustrated in the class? Is is he way ahead and bored in the class? Are the same or similar behaviors happening at home? 

Basically have yourself or a teacher observe what‚Äôs happening before and after (antecedents and consequences) of his hitting behavior to figure out what‚Äôs really going on. I‚Äôm sure he knows right from wrong and knows he shouldn‚Äôt hit, but he‚Äôs likely lacking some skills either in communication or peer relationships or academics is that is causing him to act out this way."
ElementaryTeachers,"A behavior chart could help! i.e.Sperate chart by hours of the day(or half hour depending on structure). Every hour he keeps his hands to himself, he earns a sticker or something. Certain number of stickers add up to a reward. Sometimes if parents are involved they might get 5 minutes of screen time for every sticker they earn or something."
ElementaryTeachers,Give yourself a good couple of weeks before you get into academic curriculum. The first few days are about getting them to buy into you and creating a classroom community. Well worth it.
ElementaryTeachers,"Always try to reach out to families with good news and info. Build that trusting relationship so if you ever have to make a difficult call, the relationship has a foundation already."
ElementaryTeachers,"Make sure you know how each kid gets home.  If nothing catches fire and no one gets seriously injured the call it a successful day. 
Start with routines and procedures and what you expect behavior wise."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you, this feels so warm and kind. Thank you."
ElementaryTeachers,Mistakes will be made and tears may be shed but you will only become a better teacher because of it. You got this.
ElementaryTeachers,"Here some random tidbits from my experience‚Ä¶ Have everything planned and then some, but realize you won‚Äôt get to it all. Make sure to say each kids‚Äô name at least once. Don‚Äôt be afraid to say ‚Äúno.‚Äù Get some academics in, like a letter writing activity (for example, letter to yourself to be opened on last day of school. Plus, it gives you a writing sample right away hehe).  Read them a picture book. Be sure to contact each family some way if you haven‚Äôt already, as it guarantees first home interaction is a positive one. And have fun!

Remember it‚Äôs normal to feel very nervous!  I just finished my sixth year and first day jitters don‚Äôt go away (even the year I looped with the same class lol). 

Now I‚Äôm rambling haha, but one more. I try and do a ‚Äú2 minute interview‚Äù with each student over the first week. I just find a good time to simply ask each student questions about them (one on one) for 2 minutes. 

Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,You could also look into getting a hand squeeze whistle.
ElementaryTeachers,We like anything that is free.
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh great idea! I‚Äôll have to check with them re: the electronic option, but sounds like a good option. Thank you."
ElementaryTeachers,"Does your school require you to use a mouth whistle? I‚Äôve heard of some teachers switching to electronic whistles for sanitary reasons, so that might be a good option for you! I think they‚Äôre around $12-18USD on Amazon.

Otherwise my best suggestion is to go with one of those rubber covers for it."
ElementaryTeachers,Not a teach but yes! Take it to a low income school district if possible
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! I will box up all the paper and paper punches and other items and bring them to the school
ElementaryTeachers,Absolutely üíØ yes!
ElementaryTeachers,Absolutely! Any local school/teacher would be happy to have it. :)
ElementaryTeachers,Yes! Take it to your school of choice and drop it off at the front office!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, teachers love card stock!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you, this is a very lovely practice"
ElementaryTeachers,Ask your students! I plan to allow them to decide what acceptable behavior is and isn't as well as defining features of a happy community. Then I will put that on an anchor chart to reference often. Gives them agency and a sense of responsibility heading into the year :)
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,I can help!
ElementaryTeachers,I'll do it! Send me a pm.
ElementaryTeachers,"I guess all I can compare with is how he was this time last year.  His behaviors have improved from then, although some still persist.  But a year ago, we were dealing with much worse stuff.  

I am concerned about him being bored... That's my primary concern, that he won't be challenged."
ElementaryTeachers,"My question would be, Do you have reason to believe that these issues will resolve themselves within the next year?  If it isn't reasonable to think they will resolve, I would not hold him back. If he is academically on track, he may even be bored with another year of Kinder, and that can lead to a host of behavior issues as well.
The way you have described him I don't feel confident that retention would give you what you're looking for, but he is also your child so you obviously know all the nuances of his little self."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for sharing your opinion!  I know that either way we will be involved.  I'm fortunate that we're comfortably middle class so we have just enough time and are financially stable enough to involve him in other activities.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm a first grade teacher so this is all my opinion on what I see. Generally, the younger kids are the ones who struggle. This is not necessarily true, one of my smartest kids this year had a end of July birthday. However as a generalization I have seen that pattern. I think if he is socially immature that‚Äôs what you need to think about. I wish there was a better solution with your sons daycare. I will add that what I have seen the most consistent is the smartest and most well adjusted kids are those that take place in activities outside of school/daycare (like soccer, football, etc), something about the discipline and team work it takes that helps them thrive in school."
ElementaryTeachers,Yes. Or we do a craft where it looks like a snowman with different ways to show a number in each of the snowballs. Just somehow to incorporate our lessons into art.
ElementaryTeachers,"Where I'm from, alot of teachers teach a theme. Say it's Australian History of when the British sent our founding fathers, prisoners, to Australia and how the country was set up by the British in the beginning. Anyway, if that was the theme then teachers would do a lesson where they get the kids to do a drawing/painting of the first fleet. They would then hang it up on the wall with the main goal for alot of teachers being getting their classroom decorated. (Not having a dig at the teachers here our curriculum is impossibly loaded with more goals then is realistically achieveable and they just want to get the classroom looking like a nice place to be instead of a sterile room for the ). Is this how is work over there?"
ElementaryTeachers,"We aren‚Äôt expected to teach art, however we usually incorporate it into our core subjects."
ElementaryTeachers,"Well to the club. For questions I would ask the following. 
1. Why did you become a teacher?
2. Where do you find joy right now in the classroom?
3. What advice would you give first year teacher/pre-service teachers( that‚Äôd be you)

Mind you, most teachers depending on your state and situation went through a spin cycle of a year and many districts did use the nice fabric softener so you may get a bit of spice from last year. 11 years has allowed them to see the normal and gone their skills. 

Most programs require you to be in the classroom for observation for dozens and dozens of hours. 

I‚Äôd recommend while you working in college, find a school program (afterschool, club, amusement park, summer camp) where toy are working  directly with students. I like afterschool program setting because it‚Äôs a great simulator for the classroom. 

Best of luck on observation and studies. If you have any questions reply here or DM work too. 

(9 year Elem teacher gr. 1,2,3,5)"
ElementaryTeachers,"You‚Äôll most likely be back in a classroom for your program, so more things will pop up as you go.

I‚Äôd ask about work/life balance - what does a typical day look like after the kids are gone.

What are some of the basic classroom management tips they have for you. 

You can shadow 1000 teachers and get 2000 different answers. Just remember that what they answer my gut not always be right for you and your room, but it‚Äôs nice to get perspective."
ElementaryTeachers,"Nova Scotia, Canada, but I can also speak for New Brunswick, Canada as well. Elementary school teachers teach everything but FSL/ESL, Music, and PE. Art is taught by specialists from Middle School."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,"So if there is no funding and art is cut, are you classroom teachers expected to teach it or is it only taught if there is funding? 

And this may be answered by the first question but the Title 1's that do teach it they are having a specialist art teacher come in? 

Thanks for answering all these questions by the way."
ElementaryTeachers,"We have art, Spanish, PE, and music at my K-8 school, which is also Title 1. This year we tried adding Theater Arts (but the teacher found a different job for next year so we cut it.) We also have science, which is still core content, but taught by a specialist teacher."
ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs underfunded. Not all title 1 schools don‚Äôt teach art, but cuts need to be made and a lot of time it‚Äôs art."
ElementaryTeachers,Just reading up on title 1. Is that all the tough schools? So all the tough schools don't teach art?
ElementaryTeachers,We don‚Äôt have art - title 1 school in the USA
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm in the USA and I‚Äôm an elementary school art teacher
ElementaryTeachers,Most elementary schools have an Art teacher who teaches every grade level. They usually see a class for about 45-60minutes once a week.
ElementaryTeachers,"In elementary school we teach art, in high school there is a specialized teacher. Canada."
ElementaryTeachers,"Art, music and PE are specialists that teach their own class"
ElementaryTeachers,"I had specialized art classes in Indiana. In Oregon, no. I teach it if I have time"
ElementaryTeachers,We have specialized teachers here in Tennessee.
ElementaryTeachers,So are you saying that no one teaches it in elementary school in your district because it is not on the curriculum? Are you in a metropolitan area? Thanks for the response.
ElementaryTeachers,Teach art?...yeah no....maybe if it was on a state test.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey mate, I'm from Australia. Wondering if you could answer this question at all. In Australia we don't have specialised Art Teachers for elementary schools except, I believe, in the state of Victoria. What is this like in the U.S.A?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Personally, I'm a big proponent of Growth Mindset and encourage it in my classroom. Class Dojo has many good video lessons that teach Growth Mindset concepts that I believe were created in collaboration with Carol Dweck (Growth Mindset guru)."
ElementaryTeachers,"Many schools have a school wide values program, or character education. That is something you can build on."
ElementaryTeachers,My opinion would be to let the students have a voice in collecting chosing their class core values.
ElementaryTeachers,Collaboration and listening to the ideas of others.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes. This 100%. I have always been super shy and introverted myself but have found that being a teacher (4 years in now) has allowed me to grow tremendously and I‚Äôm more outgoing than I‚Äôve ever been. I think confidence comes along with experience and the more you interact with parents and colleagues, the more comfortable you‚Äôll feel being in uncomfortable situations. Do it! If teaching is your calling, you won‚Äôt regret it!üòä"
ElementaryTeachers,"I tend to be introverted. I'm happy to jam to my own beat. With my students, it's my space. My island. I'm inviting them to be a part of my little island and I feel safe being a bit more open with them. We can joke and laugh and play and it still feels small. I think classrooms can be really busy and chaotic and that was always very overwhelming for me as a kid so I try to make space for kids like me. We have ""low key"" times. I lower the lights and play some Lo-Fi music (no lyrics) and students work independently while I take care of housekeeping tasks or meet individually with students. I do it occasionally when students are working with whisper-pairs. Students will often request the lo-fi over sitting in silence."
ElementaryTeachers,"Growing up as a quiet, introverted kid I honestly DREADED my hyper, outgoing teachers. It felt like they were always up to some scheme to get me ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù and I just wanted to be left alone and do my work in peace. Extroverted teachers are amazing but so are the quiet ones. When I first started teaching I was concerned about my personality not being engaging enough for kindergartners but I eventually discovered it doesn‚Äôt matter. We did a lot of whispering in class, had quiet thinking time, calm water/snack breaks throughout the day... and the kids learned and had a great year. There is a website that has some articles about introverts in school, definitely check it out. It‚Äôs called quietrev.com"
ElementaryTeachers,"I am extremely shy and introverted with new people (adults) but I‚Äôm a completely different person in the classroom. With my students it feels like I can be loud, silly, and a different version of me. Even with my own team it took over a year to ‚Äúcome out of my shell‚Äù when I first started. I‚Äôve actually had a parent tell me that she can tell, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to talk to parents.‚Äù  I had to explain to her that it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like talking to parents, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm just not good with it. Over the past 4 years though I think being a teacher has really helped me to become less shy and able to talk to people better. If you are truly interested in elementary education, I say go for it!"
ElementaryTeachers,Mathigon maybe. Geogebra has some applets you can play with. Mathigon is like an interactive virtual textbook. The geogebra site probably has more in the way of manipulatives /hands on kind of stuff
ElementaryTeachers,www[ToyTheater](www.toytheater.com) and [PHET simulators](https://phet.colorado.edu/) are both wonderful to use for hands on digital usage.
ElementaryTeachers,Yes. Half.
ElementaryTeachers,‚ù§Ô∏è
ElementaryTeachers,Teachers are boring. If you want to live a boring life be a teacher
ElementaryTeachers,Happiness? Teacher üíú
ElementaryTeachers,I want to be happy most of all. Money doesn‚Äôt matter so much since it will be a second income to help my family my husband is the bread winner.. but money always helps!
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,Do you want $$?
ElementaryTeachers,Teacher here. Choose hygienist.
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm hearing that a lot from teachers. I appreciate the response and sharing your experience!
ElementaryTeachers,"Dental hygienist. Teachers with kids are so stressed, I feel for them. Your work will be done when you clock out. You won‚Äôt be pressured to stay late and arrive early, buy materials, or volunteer time. Might get out earlier sometimes as a teacher though so there is that. Don‚Äôt take only my word for it though. I burned out."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the response!
ElementaryTeachers,"If you care, you‚Äôll be disappointed and distraught, because many, I mean the public etc, I‚Äôm talking about closest ‚Äúpublic‚Äù to the students, don‚Äôt care."
ElementaryTeachers,"Dental hygienist. In WA I think I starts about 80k but goes up from there. Teachers? Too busy, too vague, things changing all the time. Start at 60k with BA."
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach high school science, so demand may be different, but I had no problem getting a job with my alt cert. my program allowed me to take one semester of classes and start teaching on a temporary provisional license until I graduated. Student teaching was my actual job so I just got observed like 10 times a year by my university. So I subbed for a semester, got my foot in the door at a few schools and had a job lined up before the end of the school year I was subbing (which was actually just one semester by the time I started subbing). If you are taking on federal loans or have already, look into schools/districts that qualify for forgiveness."
ElementaryTeachers,Good job! =o)
ElementaryTeachers,I am so dumb
ElementaryTeachers,Is it correct? https://imgur.com/a/hXJNnG1
ElementaryTeachers,"Paying for the Master's is a major drawback. I got my alt. Certification for less than $4k and even got a grant so I only payed like $1500 total. 
The pay increase if you have a masters is not worth it in my opinion. You'd be better off with an alternative certification and experience as a sub. Just that makes you a great candidate"
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs fish
ElementaryTeachers,"I did an alternative certification program and didn‚Äôt have any problems getting hired, but in hindsight I wish I had gone the traditional route. I think the experience of student teaching with a veteran teacher is invaluable, and overall I would have been better prepared, in many ways."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thia is just my experience, but I did a combined BS and MS in elementary education in college, and the only district that didn't offer me a job was the one I most wanted to work in. I saw some folks on /r/teachers suggest that some places might be hesitant to hire those with a master's and less experience compared to someone with just a bachelor's degree and a comparable experience level, because they're on a lower step on the salary schedule. And I wondered if that happened to me.

On the other hand, a rep from that district contacted me in October and asked if I was interested on coming and teaching in January. I think with many resignations lately, schools are less likely to turn away most anyone who's qualified."
ElementaryTeachers,I had a very difficult time getting hired with my Master‚Äôs through an initial licensure program. I was passed over repeatedly for Teach for America candidates.
ElementaryTeachers,"Masters is essential to qualify to teach in many areas, from my experience. I was alternatively certified through an IEP program years ago. I find that my masters degree impresses many (they want to be able to say that their teachers are ""highly qualified""). But regarding how I was certified, I've encountered a lot of snobbishness from teachers who were ed majors."
ElementaryTeachers,Fushi?
ElementaryTeachers,"Was just coming back to say this too. Subbing would be my suggestion for where to start. It would give you a feel for the work, plus help make some connections if you do decide to teach."
ElementaryTeachers,"Indeed - ""but teachers have summers off!"" Lol I work 10-11 hour days and 6-8 hrs on the weekend, my hours are the equivalent of a 14 month calendar. ""I bet it's so fulfilling though"" - yes it is, immensely so, yet my bank doesn't accept ""fulfilment"" as a substitute for currency to pay off my mortgage. 

But hot butter when those little 8YOs yell ""Mr. Stew819 is the best teacher ever"" I know I won't ever go back to another job."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the thoughtful response!!
ElementaryTeachers,I think those are called tangrams
ElementaryTeachers,"To answer your question, I am so young so I don‚Äôt know what it is like to be a parent but I don‚Äôt think that the breaks off are worth it. You will be working so hard during the year. I think it‚Äôs better to have a job that doesn‚Äôt have that many breaks but gets nights/weekends free. Being a hygienist can be gross and you still have to deal with idiots  but it might be more doable and flexible because you won‚Äôt be taking work home with you. 

That being said, you won‚Äôt know unless you try. Don‚Äôt jump into anything. Volunteer in classrooms, spend time with kids (even rude kids and kids with bad behavior) and see if you can handle it. Maybe be a classroom assistant or para or something. See if you can handle the lesson planning. Only go into it after that. The pay is also very less for all the work you do. I‚Äôm a student teaching not even a full time one and I‚Äôm already finding a way to get out."
ElementaryTeachers,"Funny you mentioned Human Resources, I‚Äôm thinking of getting into that in the future. Teaching is too much work and you have to deal with really bad behavior."
ElementaryTeachers,"Do not be a teacher. The year my wife taught nearly killed them. As a new teacher, there was zero chance of being in a good school, because those were the positions everyone wanted and they only accepted experienced teachers. They were told point-blank ""You're new, so we're giving you a class with all the worst kids in the school.""

It was not a joke. Kids that slept, that attended school only to sell drugs, kids that cursed or threatened, and at one point the class made up a song about how they were going to get my wife fired because they found out about me. (We're a lesbian couple.)

That would have been bad enough, but the administration basically turned around and blamed my wife for everything that went wrong ‚Äî stating that if kids failed, it was the teacher's fault for ""not connecting,"" even though my wife was doing absolutely everything they asked, up to and including working almost seven days a week and spending our own money to try and keep the classroom together.

Echoing the others here, don't think it's your job to try and teach just because there's a need. The TRUTH is that there are a lot of incredible teachers out there; it's the SYSTEM that needs to change. 

You might want to see if there's a non-teaching position like lunch staff, office, after-school, etc. My aunt does this primarily so she can get insurance, and it's much less soul-sucking.

I can't speak to Dentistry, but other possibilities are maybe a counselor/therapist or administration for a health care setting. This is what I do now; zero medical background but now I schedule appointments and do timekeeping for a single department at a hospital."
ElementaryTeachers,"This is my 10th year as a teacher. I currently work 10-12 hours a day. And work on the weekends. If your kids are younger, I don't recommend it. It's a very difficult profession to work in right now."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm a sub teacher for the past 6 years since I retired from government.  Get with a teacher/teacher aide staffing agency first. That way you can pick and choose what schools you want to work in and what days you want to work. Subs are a godsend for staff. When it gets on your nerves, and it will, you can go online and drop the assignment. This way you can flex your time around your kids. You will need a background check and get certified thru your state. I sub at my granddaughter 's school sometime since her mother and my son are not together in a relationship. I can pop by to say hi or see her on the playground. I subbed in the early 80's before I went to government. Things are VERY different and the children are VERY different  (behavior) so be very careful. Parents are VERY different also (much younger). You may want to start out as an aide in the lower grades if you can deal with the constant chatter..lol. I stay away from the middle and high school students....too many hormones and anger issues unless they are seniors looking forward to graduation and college. Middle school is rough. Private schools pay less (i.e. catholic schools) but the children are better disciplined and better behaved at Catholic schools. I've done Catholic and public schools; I just do public, urban and suburban...much more cultural, gender, religious and racial diversity. I like it and the flexibility.I hope this helps and good luck with your decision."
ElementaryTeachers,Become a private tutor
ElementaryTeachers,I appreciate the reply. Dental hygiene school is ridiculous too but I guess it‚Äôs only for two years. I worry how I will get through such a rigorous program with two little kids.
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is a job with low pay and long hours. As a mother, you may enjoy being a dental hygienist more. You won't bring your work home with you and you'll still get holidays off. You can still be involved in education/work with children  as a volunteer at schools, children camp, scouts or through sports. I'm sorry these comments are not the most encouraging. But teaching requires a ridiculous time investment that may take away from the parts of your life you already enjoy."
ElementaryTeachers,I appreciate the honesty! I had a feeling that would be the case.
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is hard but a needed field. However, as someone who went through an education program and had nontraditional students in my program, I would say no. It‚Äôs much harder to get a job as a new teacher when you are past the traditional college grad age. It sucks and shouldn‚Äôt really be the case, but schools are more likely to hire new teachers that are younger and fresh out of college or veteran teachers."
ElementaryTeachers,"I am not but a couple family members of mine are dentist's , work in hygeine or are CDA's. Where I currently am there's a shortage of hygeine and CDA's so some practices are paying near $100,000 a year, and that doesn't necessarily require a ton of experience."
ElementaryTeachers,Are you a hygienist?
ElementaryTeachers,I'd say for financial reasons go for hygeine. The money can be very good depending on where you are with some potentially good hours. Many offices run 10 hour days so you could end up with a very desirable 4X10 schedule making really good money.
ElementaryTeachers,"You can try teaching at a different school with a small student count. Also make sure you only work 8 hours in a day and no time on the weekend. You need that work-life balance. Otherwise, that's basically all I can say. If you still feel this is not your cup of tea, it's okay to look for a new career. My experience was pretty much like yours, and I stuck around for 10 years. If teaching is not your thing, it is crazy to think it will get better. It didn't for me, so I am in gradschool for accounting. But don't waste 10 years doing something you dislike. Life's too short."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think you care more than you should. It is still just a job, and the kids don't care about it as much as you think. The admins don't give a crap about you as well."
ElementaryTeachers,We need a second income. Not just about fulfillment. I would like a career that is helping people in some capacity.
ElementaryTeachers,"Charter schools are hit or miss, but usually miss imo. Nevada does have a teacher's union, so that's good. Is there a reason only teaching or dental hygienist are on the table? Do you need the additional income you'd bring from working or is it only personal fulfillment (which is SUPER valid, just makes you think about things differently).

Do kids need good teachers - a huge YES!! But imo the problem with the US is not that there's a shortage of good teachers, it's that there's a shortage of support or caring about good teachers from all sides (parents, admin, students). Just check out r/teachers for a look at what's going on the US. Insanely low pay, no air conditioning, no toilet paper, buy your own supplies, students that are apathetic with parents that don't care and YOU get blamed for all of it. Teachers are constantly, constantly scapegoated all. the. time. A lot of time about stuff they don't even have control over. We are told to ""do it for the kids"" and neglect our own health and families in order to do so. If you don't martry yourself, you're painted as a ""bad"" teacher by admin often.

If you feel teaching is your calling, I'm not going to tell you not to do it. But you HAVE to go into it with your guard and defenses way way up or they will take advantage of you and your time. Your first 5 years will be devastatingly hard, and that's ""normal"" for the US. You'll still need to jump through licensing and development hoops, a lot of which will take up your summer time and weekends.

Imo - Do some volunteering at your son's school and get a feel for it. If it's fulfillment you're looking for, there are many ways to be a teacher without being a ""teacher"". Fwiw, I teach at a great school, with great students, but I would leave it all in a heartbeat if we could swing the health insurance so I could be with my kid full-time."
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh boy. Please don't buy into the bullshit that by being a teacher you're somehow saving the world, at least for your own good. I bought into it when I was in my early 20s. But I saved nobody, destroyed my mental health, nearly became an alcoholic, and go to the point where I was so stressed I couldn't maintain any relationships with people. The narrative that as a teacher you'll be able to mold young mind is a complete and utter lie. School districts don't give a shit about kids otherwise they would listen to their staff and pass policies that help education. If you choose teaching, you'll making barely 40k, while admins will start at least 80k. In Reno, our administration was make as much as a CEO of small company. It is not about kids."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve heard this but good teachers are still needed. I worry about the future of my kids if no good people become teachers. I almost feel like I‚Äôm being called to it since there is such a need. It makes me sad that people say to not go into teaching- don‚Äôt our kids need good teachers?
ElementaryTeachers,"Like LonleyHermione said, if you are in the US, I would also advise you against teaching. The culture is toxic and teachers are consistently overworked."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm in Henderson, Nevada. Las Vegas area. The school my son goes to is amazing. There are also a lot of charter schools. I know this area isn‚Äôt known for having good schools but they do exist. I don‚Äôt know about a union it I would think it does not. Part of what is making me afraid to pursue dental hygiene is how competitive getting into a program is and all the prerequisites needed as well as the fact that the program is extremely grueling and intense. Doing a program like that with two young children jakes me nervous. But maybe the first 5 years of teaching would be just as grueling for a longer period of time."
ElementaryTeachers,"What country are you in? Because teaching in the US is something VERY different than teaching anywhere else. If you're in the US - what region? Do you have a union? Does your district support teachers? Being a teacher can be very rewarding, but it can also be EXTREMELY stressful and draining, and the first 5 years are almost guaranteed to be that way no matter where you are. If you're thinking about the teacher route, I would start by volunteering at a local elementary school to get a feel for what teaching would be like. There is a big difference between taking care of 2 kids and teaching a class of 25. (Both are hard jobs, just in very different ways.)"
ElementaryTeachers,Update: [Link to use Multiplication Table Exercises online](https://telvannichad.github.io/MultiplicationTableExercises/MultiplicationTableExercises.html)
ElementaryTeachers,"They..
 Charge you??

That's insane. Imagine any other line of work doing that.
Our district has a print shop to cut down on cost. They keep track of who orders and stuff but I've never heard anything about a limit."
ElementaryTeachers,"That policy sounds a bit crazy to me as well.

At my school, we have a limit on making copies in color, but not black-and-white."
ElementaryTeachers,I worked a school where they allocated you one ream or ‚Ä¶500 pieces per month. For an elementary school. After that it was up to you. It was ridiculous. Supply closet was locked. The secretary would count out paper clips if you needed any. Yay Arizona.
ElementaryTeachers,"No limit on copies, but we have to ask permission to print in color ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,Differentiation means Chromebooks all day and every day!!!
ElementaryTeachers,"We have a set number of color copies, but for writing I color code everything so there are 4 words highlighted on student writing assignments. I print one with my ID and then walk down to make my other 90 copies since it doesn‚Äôt require me to sign in."
ElementaryTeachers,"We used to have this on our copiers. We figured out that it stored all the passwords with the completed jobs list. We decided to just pick someone's number and my whole grade level team used that. The principal wasn't amused when one teacher had thousands of copies on record, but the entire 6th grade had hardly any."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I have a limit on copies, but I don't usually go over mine (resource teacher) and it's totally INSANE that they're charging you for copies. It's annoying and garbage and just another drop in the bucket of horrible working conditions for teachers in the US. If I were you, I'd let a local news outlet know that - that's asinine.

For me, I usually get through the year by using lapboards (dry erase marker stored in a black sock which serves as an eraser) and these [dry erase pockets](https://www.amazon.com/C-Line-Reusable-Pockets-Inches-Assorted/dp/B002RUG8WU/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_i=B002RUG8WU&amp;psc=1). If you go with the pockets, put a thinner piece of cardboard in there to make it stiff enough to write on. You can actually store a couple different worksheets in the pockets and have the kids switch them out as needed. I print them on cardstock so they have an easier time with this and reuse the worksheets year after year."
ElementaryTeachers,"Classroom size is too small, the issue is moot for the week anyhow, covid outbreak in the classroom, again..... :("
ElementaryTeachers,"I don't think you owe anyone an explanation. ""I am retiring from teaching this December."" If anyone asks why just say it's the right time for you. It's really nobody's business.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh gosh, I am really sorry to hear this. I recently quit my job to pursue teaching and am currently working at a high school. 

May I ask in what state you are teaching? I‚Äôm resonating to this slightly and it‚Äôs making me wonder if I made the correct decision."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, good point about making sure the students know it's not their fault. Thanks! God knows they're the only reason I hadn't decided to leave sooner."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think, ""Due to circumstances beyond my control"" and taking ""extended leave"" is a great idea. It's still honest, but lacking all the gory details. Thanks for the suggestion!

Unfortunately, they haven't found replacements for the other teachers who have left. So yes, it was an unbearably difficult decision to make, knowing that the students may be in the hands of a non-certified substitute. You'd think the district would've made some serious changes before it got to this point, knowing how many teachers have been leaving and not being able to hire replacements. Despite this very issue keeping me awake at night, I know this is absolutely what I need to do.

Thank you for your thoughtful response!"
ElementaryTeachers,"First of all, good for you for looking out for your own well-being and doing what is best for you. Teachers put themselves last far too often and are often encouraged to do so. This can‚Äôt have been an easy decision for you.

How transparent are you comfortable being about your decision to leave? Would it make sense to tell families that ‚Äúdue to circumstances beyond my control, I will be taking an extended leave from the classroom‚Äù? (IMO, they don‚Äôt need to know that ‚Äúextended‚Äù = ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù!)

I would keep it short and emphasize how grateful you are to have worked with their kids/how much you appreciate their support in this challenging year, etc. etc. Let them know their students will be in great hands with your replacement and if they have any questions about their new teacher, please reach out to (insert name of someone who isn‚Äôt you here).

As far as when to tell them, I think sooner is better so it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre springing it on them and so your students have time to adjust to the idea of you leaving.

Sorry for the long response but I hope some part of it is helpful! Best of luck to you in your new chapter! :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"If you really don't want to say anything negative, you can address your own health and wellness as your reason for leaving mid-year. 

You are mich kinder than I! If I was  able to leave, I would absolutely detail the expectations of teachers this year and how the stress is unreasonable and inhumane.

One way or the other, I would make sure the kids know that it is not their fault, and you will miss them and your time together."
ElementaryTeachers,This is so cool. Definitely using this!
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach kindergarten but we have a school-wide PBIS system so the kids can earn ‚Äúloot‚Äù like a paper dollar and turn it in for a chance to win ‚Äúwinner Wednesday‚Äù when the principal draws some loot the kids wrote their names on and win a special prize or activity. You could do a winner bucket with your class, and try snd do some coupons or some other classroom reward. We‚Äôve also done points - the class get one when they do the right thing, you get one when you have to remind them or wait for them to get quiet. We also have sticker charts and a prize bucket. Sometimes it helps just to get them in the habit of doing the right thing. We also give them a number in their daily folder to show how their choices were they day - needed lots of reminders, did well, etc. Class Dojo is a great app to give kids points for different positive traits, and you can take them away too. It might feel like bribing but I‚Äôve worked with a lot of students with autism and it made a huge difference for me to teach them the right behaviors with incentives, starting with super high frequency and tapering off. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"My students needed help with communication so I did an activity where they had to sort themselves into groups all while communicating effectively. I had them try the first time with no help as they sort of themselves from birthdays starting January 1 all the way to December 31. They would likely stumble through this and need help and might not be able to get everybody lined up in a time limit you decide. Once this happens pause take everyone over to the carpet or meeting area and discuss what worked well and what didn‚Äôt work well. Give a few pointers like electing teams to work with months or a process of discussion like hand raising. Then let them try again. After that‚Äôs all done and you‚Äôve established a few communication strategies that you want students to use do the activity again but for this one you can‚Äôt talk. I found stickers different different colors and place them on every students forehead. Students must then use nonverbal communication skills through body language in ways that are effective. My students really like this challenge and all of my students really need help with communicating effectively. Hopefully this helps! 
Good luck and have a great year!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"We have, without the circle, the classroom is a bit constricted. The primary limiter is a set of 4 boys and 2 girls that were introduced in the new class that have behavioural as well as academic issues.   


I'm reading through new things to work on, but so far no go."
ElementaryTeachers,"This might sound silly, but have you tried sitting them down for a class meeting? I did it once where I sat them in a circle and explained how I feel as the teacher when they don‚Äôt listen, talk during class, etc. then I opened the floor for them to share how they feel when others are disruptive during class time. It got them all on the same page and realized that most of the class disliked the way others were acting."
ElementaryTeachers,"We have, unfortunately it doesn't seem to work with the second 3rd grade class.

I'm at a loss, traditional and even newer technological ideas don't seem to be working here."
ElementaryTeachers,"Vote on issues, majority rules‚Ä¶ perhaps introduce the term ‚Äúdisagree and commit‚Äù not always going to like things at work but ultimately you‚Äôre a team and you need to have each other‚Äôs back 
Conflict isn‚Äôt a bad thing, means that people care but at the end of the day things need to be decided"
ElementaryTeachers,What is your classroom management style? Have you tried using something like Class Dojo to give rewards? I teach 2nd and just the mention of dojo points gets them back on track.
ElementaryTeachers,"Well, we always seem to meet to talk about issues instead of resolving them and they end up never getting resolved. And maybe high expectations isn‚Äôt the best way to explain it. It‚Äôs almost as if flexibility just isn‚Äôt a strong suit and it‚Äôs just so hard to work with when that‚Äôs literally one of the biggest things about teaching. Principals are notified when the tiniest thing goes wrong, too. I could go on with nitty gritty stuffs, but that‚Äôs the general idea."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes! Very relatable. Thanks so much, that‚Äôs actually super helpful!"
ElementaryTeachers,I stand in front of the class in my power pose and wait until the class is quiet. I also use more sign/body language so students have to stop and look at me. Book suggestion: envoy and other books by that author? I also teach third.
ElementaryTeachers,What are her expectations so high about? What kind of come to Jesus meetings?
ElementaryTeachers,"I had this almost exact same situation.
I don't know what it's like in your case but in mine she would get upset about things that didn't even affect her. If I could to back I would put up some firm boundaries and be more self assured. We ultimately had to report to our boss though."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! I think I‚Äôll use this. The idea of keeping a steady beat being connected to reading fluency is really intriguing to me. I‚Äôll have to talk with our kindergarten teacher about that!
ElementaryTeachers,"Aw, thanks! Back at ya. And I'm sure you do fine with the seating charts. Still, it's like preparing for a major diplomatic meeting sometimes, isn't it? LOL

So, my classroom has 13 students and 4 tables. Obviously, that doesn't divide perfectly, so I have 3 tables of 3 and one of 4 (I actually started with 16 before they made another class and moved 3 kids out, because admin, of course, wants to make sure they can keep reminding parents that our class sizes are smaller than average). Part of that at least works out well, since everyone wants to sit at the green table (they're all painted different colors), so I can put 4 at the green table. I'm trying to rotate who's at which table each month so that everyone has a chance to work with everyone else but at the same time not put my chattiest students together, if that makes sense. I have two boys who are best buds, and while I love that they are, I'm worried that they would distract each other constantly at the same table (I will probably let them sit together at some point with the stipulation that they'll get moved if talking becomes an issue). I also let the students spend class points to sit at the green table, with the understanding that we need to let everyone have a chance at sitting there (I have no idea why it's popular, but, hey, I can work with that). When we do morning meetings or circle time or anything like that, I let them sit wherever, of course.

If I had desks, I would probably do groups as well, assuming they were open front desks. The nice thing is that you can change the seating around most anytime (""Oh, it was just getting a little boring!"" or some such).  I like table arrangements for group work, but unless you can make them all even, I know it could get weird for partner work."
ElementaryTeachers,"Omg! That is so much differentiation it almost seems impossible (but i bet you‚Äôre doing a great job!)

Cutting corners are essential. I‚Äôm as good as a teacher as I am with 1 prep period and 4 different preps to plan for. I could be a better teacher‚Ä¶.if I had more planning time. So I make sure I do the necessities and anything else I have time for I can do.

Stay strong!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm happy you ended with some good Halloween festivities! Any advice you can share on how you make seating charts? When I make mine I alsways think I have it perfect ‚Ä¶. Until they come in and I realize I messed up.

Wishing you a happy and healthy November!"
ElementaryTeachers,definitely did plan on making sure first :)
ElementaryTeachers,Some traditions should be left for parents to do with their kids. Do something else.
ElementaryTeachers,"Unfortunately, Elf on the Shelf would be a loud NOPE in my district for a dozen different reasons. The elementary school admin will not be happy if they get a parent complaint, so I'd check with them first. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,Please make sure that all of your students actually celebrate Christmas before doing this.
ElementaryTeachers,that‚Äôs what i was thinking. i‚Äôm going to bring it up with my director tomorrow but as of now it‚Äôs either that or i‚Äôm gonna get pictures printed of what she did each day and hang them up
ElementaryTeachers,"Are there high places you can put her in a main hall? Hanging from the clock, putting something on someone‚Äôs bulletin board?"
ElementaryTeachers,"aw that would be so cute, i just worry about her falling off. we also have a pretty violent kid that would not hesitate to rip her off and hurt her in front of the younger kids"
ElementaryTeachers,"Can you pin the elf to yourself and have it do silly things to you every day? Crazy hair day and pin the elf to your shoulder! Tape pencils all over your sleeves and pants and say the elf did it. Lipstick across your face? Lol I don‚Äôt know, just one idea! Pin the elf to your back with a sign that says ‚Äúforgets to take attendance‚Äù or something silly!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm glad October ended on an up note for you, at least, and I hope that trend continues for you in November.

Some things are rough, but I feel like it's mostly going okay. One of the helicopter parents took a break from emailing me so much this past week (though I hope it isn't because she's sick or some such). And my students had fun on Friday with their Halloween activities (thankfully, the rain took a break today, so I imagine they'll be going trick-or-treating). 

We'll do our monthly seating chart rearrangement tomorrow. Time will tell if everything will go okay there, haha."
ElementaryTeachers,"It's good, but tough. I'm in my second year of teaching grade 3, so still getting familiar with the curriculum. I have 23 students, and 8 of them are on Individual Education Plans. 

The vast majority of them are reading at a low grade 2 level, but 2 could easily be in grade 4. 

I have a student who has both Down Syndrome and cerebral palsy. He has a full time support worker, but I have to find lessons and create differentiated instruction for him, and the 7 others on IEPs. 

I'm in the school by 7 or earlier everyday, and not gone till 5 or later, and I barely feel like I'm keeping my head above water. Everyone says to pace myself, and take care of myself, but whatever corners I cut are important.  

I'm exhausted, and constantly feeling guilty that I'm not doing nearly enough. 

Thanks for asking! üòäüòä"
ElementaryTeachers,"My daughter is a teacher. She has enough candy, mugs, and general stuff to fill a warehouse. She is THRILLED with gift cards. They're truly the best"
ElementaryTeachers,"One year I got a really nice pair of fuzzy reading socks from chapters. Those were bomb. Also cute tote bags are handy. Once I got a Swarovski crystal pen! Food is always welcome, especially nice chocolate or something similar. Wee plants are cute. I got a hilarious giant card that two of my kiddos made on a playdate last year, that was sweet. I like the things the kiddies make best, but that's just me. I got a handful of flowers from their garden that I loved. One kid gave me a version her favourite pop-it and that was too lovely. I think letting the kids pick is adorable."
ElementaryTeachers,"I have to be honest, I love gift cards! While a gift is never not loved, I don't need another mug or ornament. What if your child decorated a clay pot and helped plant a simple philodendron? Simple, easy and relatively inexpensive. Plus your child gets a say in the creation of it."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you! It is so hard to get responses! I need 100 so if you get a chance, please share the link with all of your teacher friends!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm not saying it should be quick-fire, or that there shouldn't be restorative practices. If it helps, I'd like to say I actually agree with you - there has been a lot of trauma, some people are too quick to be punitive, and being punitive typically only ""works"" with kids who aren't usually in trouble anyway.

I do feel however that while that individual kid has been through trauma, so has the rest of the class, and so has the teacher. When the same kid has just pulled the rest of the class off topic for the 8th time in 3 days... Well maybe everyone needs a break. Honestly, sometimes the kids themselves need a break. 

People are human and when you're on edge, in a negative spiral etc., you sometimes need a little distance to reset. A former administrator of mine used to call parents and say ""this is what happened. I'm not suspending little Johnny, but he needs some space and needs to go home for the rest of the day before he actually does get himself in trouble."" When he comes back, that's when the restorative piece comes back. It's not punitive, but it does allow the situation to die down a little before punitive measures are necessary."
ElementaryTeachers,"Just did your survey! I am a kindergarten teacher in grad school so I understand how hard it is to get teachers to participate in surveys!! ü§£ü§£

Good luck in all your future endeavors! üòä"
ElementaryTeachers,"And how does this factor in the literal trauma they have all gone through during this pandemic? Sending kids hone with no regard to restorative practices does nothing but delay the behavior from happening again, because in the majority of cases things don‚Äôt change simply by suspending. And this year, more than ever before, I believe we need to rethink our quick-fire responses."
ElementaryTeachers,Video games I'm not a teacher but I would say I would write the FNaF lore(five nights at freddy's)
ElementaryTeachers,Author is Jarrett Krosozka. I was close right? Haha
ElementaryTeachers,That sounds so cute! I‚Äôll check it out!
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs awesome! I have Smile but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that age range would enjoy it! I‚Äôll bring them in!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,All of the ‚Äúbranches‚Äù books are great for struggling readers at that age.  They are essentially picture books but they are also chapter books.  They have a ton of series.  Dogman and The Bad guys series are also very popular with 2-4th graders.  They also redid the babysitters club series in graphic novel.
ElementaryTeachers,El Deafo and Zita the Space Girl
ElementaryTeachers,I second most of theses suggestions and will add in ‚ÄúNew Kid‚Äù by Jerry Craft.
ElementaryTeachers,"Might be a little young for your group, but I LOVE The Lunch Lady series by Jared Schocksa (sp) it‚Äôs about a lunch lady that fights crime."
ElementaryTeachers,"Amulet, Babysitters Club, Smile/Sisters/Ghost, and Wings of Fire - have all been hits on my 4th grade classroom!"
ElementaryTeachers,"https://shop.scholastic.com/parent-ecommerce/genres/comic-books-graphic-novels.html

Check out the Professor Astro Cat books! They‚Äôre some excellent graphic-styled non-fiction. 

Also, there is always Captain Underpants and I‚Äôm pretty sure the Babysitters Club has some graphic novels now too."
ElementaryTeachers,"All of them? Honestly assessing what gaps my students are coming into the new year with, due to the spring closures. Seriously though, all subjects will be my focus."
ElementaryTeachers,sel?
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you I‚Äôll definitely try this one out!
ElementaryTeachers,"One of my classmates did a ‚Äúbuild sandwich‚Äù for our presentations. She had all the items (bread spoon/butter knife, pb and j) and asked us to explain how to make a sandwich. So logically students said ‚Äúget the bread and put some peanut butter‚Äù so she got the bag of bread and just put the jar of butter on top. Then we had to use the transition words to say ‚Äúfirst you open the bread bag and grab two slices...‚Äù using words to go step by step. Hope this helps."
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for the feedback! I will check those out.
ElementaryTeachers,Freckle is a computer program that will put students on an individual learning path and it‚Äôs free.  Xtra Math is also great for math fact practice.
ElementaryTeachers,"Depending on your state you can get an emergency permit to teach and a principal may be willing if they are having trouble finding a music teacher. I would check private schools first as they have a bit more leeway, but they pay is not as good. An emergency permit lasts for a year and then can be renewed for a second if you are showing effort to complete requirements.  Then I would look to see if your state has a transition to teaching program.  The requirements are less and if you are already in the classroom the student teaching requirement is waived. Good Luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,Did you try using a video? I‚Äôm sure there are like a million of them on YouTube.
ElementaryTeachers,"Would it help to try breaking down a familiar story (like a favorite fairytale or short story of hers) into sections and asking her to give you a transition word in between each scene?

You could either have her tell the story, or you could tell it and have her stop you each time she hears a transition word (perhaps with a list of examples nearby for reference if she needs extra reminders?) Or you could have her rewrite a story and highlight the transitions if she‚Äôs more visual.

I like fairytales as examples for this because they tend to use more obvious transition words like ‚Äúsuddenly,‚Äù ‚Äúhowever,‚Äù ‚Äúnevertheless,‚Äù ‚Äúfinally,‚Äù etc."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve already used this method to explain to my student but she still doesn‚Äôt quite understand it. She subconsciously knows how and when to use it, she just can‚Äôt use it when she‚Äôs asked to make a sentence using transition words."
ElementaryTeachers,I like to think of it as connecting ideas or events. Give examples of what a passage might sound like with and without transition words
ElementaryTeachers,Do you have video tools built in to your devices?  WeVideo and Screencastify might be places to start. 10-15 minutes seems like a very long video for young viewers. Perhaps 2 4 minute video with response activities the teachers could lead?
ElementaryTeachers,"One activity I have done in the past is created a Mad Libs kind of game.  The activity was sort of two fold in reinforcing what certain parts of speech are.  I usually stuck with Nouns, Verbs, and sometimes Adjectives.  

I let the students think of a topic and I created a sheet where I started off writing a beginning sentence, the students had to finish it.

Students would write a full sentence containing a combination of the parts of speech.  This way I let students be creative a bit and think what they want to write instead of me telling them specifics.   Students had fun with it and had them concentrate on making full sentences.  I hope this one helps!"

ElementaryTeachers,"No. Not in my district, at least. It should be updated every year, with services recommended   (Can‚Äôt see how speech helps) and interventions/strategies to try. There should be an eye exam in  there‚Äîif there is dyslexia is should have been identified way before now."
ElementaryTeachers,What should darla do?
ElementaryTeachers,"I have and read it from cover to cover. 
They only goes to speech. Their parents are speak Spanish, but he speaks perfect English. The only connection to his reading is a small paragraph within the 4 pages where they state a goal to have them reading at 80wpm by the end of next year.

I'm a first year teacher is that normal?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Are there any genres that she enjoys reading? Does she prefer the main character to be a boy or a girl, or even an animal?

My 3rd graders loved reading graphic novels such as Dog Man, The Babysitters Club, Ghosts/anything by Telgemeier. I always kept a wide variety of books in my classroom, lots of my kids still enjoyed reading the Magic Treehouse series, Goosebumps series, Eerie Elementary series, and even picture books."
ElementaryTeachers,See if you can get your hands on a copy of the IEP from the parents. It‚Äôs supposed to be updated every year. To have the issues you describe and to only be getting speech therapy seems really odd to me. Something isn‚Äôt right with this picture.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, they have an IEP. They've been put into speech therapy which does not seem to be helping to much if any."
ElementaryTeachers,"
Has an IEP been done? What kind of ‚Äúinterventions‚Äù have been done?"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you
ElementaryTeachers,I hope you are able to find what you need! If you have any questions feel free to PM me and I‚Äôll do my best to point you in the right direction.
ElementaryTeachers,I've had the suspicion that it was dyslexia. I'll have to look into Orton Gillingham. Hopefully the resources are not to expensive since we are on a tight budget and I can't pay for it myself either.
ElementaryTeachers,Put everything in a dyslexic friendly font. I use OpenDyslexic (https://opendyslexic.org).
ElementaryTeachers,It sounds like the student may have dyslexia. There are many resources available to help students with dyslexia. Look into Orton Gillingham and the international dyslexia association for more resources. Orton Gillingham uses multi-sensory methods to teach phonics skills to students.

ElementaryTeachers,"Here‚Äôs how‚Äôd I plan my tutoring sessions: First, find out what the kid is into (Minecraft, Sports, Specific Animals, TV show) Second, create a project based on this interest. Third, find an exciting medium for this - creating an ‚ÄúAll About‚Äù book, podcast, or video. Finally, have all activities sequenced to creating this final project - reading about the interest, writing about the interest (for podcast or video this would be planning a script). Likewise, find some cool short videos on YouTube about the subject to make your tutoring sessions more engaging and compliment with reading and writing activities. Best of luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs a Masters in Reading Education. It‚Äôs through the same university that I attended for undergrad, in Ohio. I can DM you the school if you want to know it. But There might be local university close to you that has it too!"
ElementaryTeachers,What online program are you doing?
ElementaryTeachers,"I have an mlis, to become a school librarian I had to get a provisional teaching license. There was state testing and several classes in education I needed. It was a bit of a pain but I achieved it within a year as required."
ElementaryTeachers,"I recommend an MBA and get while the gettins good. I have a MLIS and library jobs are few and far between, as far as teaching it gets me $3k/year but I‚Äôm still paying it off. If you are confident you want to continue teaching, go for it. I would seriously look at other career options though as well. When the unthinkable happens a teacher salary is pretty hard to fall back on, say as a single parent."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for your comment. I taught elementary art for three years after graduation and didn't have to do another student teaching experience for elementary ed. When I started subbing, I finally got the experience I really needed to use my elementary ed endorsement, but I still feel like I'm competing with everyone else with undergrad Elementary Ed degrees. I did think of SPED. I'm not sure if I would want to do that full time, but your right, they're always hiring and I know that would look good to have that background knowledge. Curious what path others have taken."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'd recommend looking for teaching assistant positions and checking private schools. I knew I wanted to teach when I graduated undergrad but didn't have an education degree either. I started with an assistant teaching job at a private school and got more experience that way. It won't be your own classroom, but it's a start and a great learning experience.

It also might depend on where you live. Some states have teacher shortages and you might be able to get a provisional license (especially if you have skills that are in high demand, like being fluent in another language). 

If you decide you want to get your license, you might be able to find certification programs that are less demanding/costly than an actual degree in education. When I was deciding to go back to school for my teaching license, I made an advising appointment at a university near me. I didn't end up going there and chose a different school, but I was still able to talk with the advisor about how long it would take to be certified, cost, etc. It helped me compare options. 

You could also consider Teach for America. I know it's sort of controversial, but it's a way to get your license and more experience. I didn't do TFA so I can't say much more about it. There are also AmeriCorps programs that are education-related, and you get an education award upon completion of your program, so that can help with expenses of going back to school. 

Hope this helps!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm getting a Masters in Reading Education this year! I‚Äôll be a first year teacher too, so I know what led me to make my choice, but I can‚Äôt speak from actual experience. 

I‚Äôm early childhood, and it‚Äôll make me more
marketable with teaching the younger grades since my state has a standardized reading test! Also, it‚Äôs needed in my state to teach certain kids with individualized reading plans in third grade. It also will allow me to teach K-12 literacy. It sounds pretty perfect for you too, since it‚Äôs applicable for both early childhood and literacy jobs and it‚Äôs not the path to administration! I‚Äôm going to stick to early childhood when I graduate, but I do like the idea that I could teach upper literacy classes in the future.

I‚Äôm not in Washington, so I don‚Äôt know the details for where you live. But you should look into it! My program will be all online (not related to COVID) while I have a regular teaching position next year."
ElementaryTeachers,"I also taught elementary with a teaching license and no Master's for a few years.  When I went back I got my Master's in Reading and got my Reading Specialist license.  I still work as an elementary classroom teacher, but now I have options.  It depends what you're interested in.  Maybe get a Master's in Elementary Ed.  I think a Master's in Reading makes you look good because this is such an important skill in all grades, and they know you'll bring this to the building and to PLCs. If there's any chance you'd do Special Education, I'd go for SPED.  Around here (Virginia) they're ALWAYS hiring for SPED."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôd like to add that you can modify lessons easily with Fundations. I taught it a lot with whiteboards and markers a lot instead of sound cards. We also modified the practice activities as needed. So it‚Äôs still possible to teach the lessons without all of the extra materials!
ElementaryTeachers,Awesome. Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,"I would get the 1st grade teacher's edition book and the large sound cards with the pictures. That's really all you have to have from Wilson to teach the program. It's ideal to have the whole teacher's kit, but in a pinch you can make the rest of the stuff yourself (write your own small sound cards on index cards, etc.)."
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you so much, it was very helpful!! Most of my worries are because I don‚Äôt know anything about next year yet. I should teach second grade! But with Covid that could even change based on the needs of the school, since it‚Äôs a stipend position. 

I love all of your notes about labels! That‚Äôs something that I probably would have forgotten to do. And the part about introducing flexible seating slowly! I really love flexible seating but I was a bit on the fence about it since it can be harder to manage. That‚Äôs a great idea! And thank you for the store recommendations! I‚Äôll be saving this comment :) Also, I will wait to buy the ‚Äúbigger‚Äù things like carpet after what you said. Thank you so much!"
ElementaryTeachers,"What grade will you be teaching? My first year I had the bare minimum but it was totally ok! You use what you have and will manage as you go. My  beginning of year list looks like this: 

I make labels for many of the things; it is super helpful for you and the kids.I teach first so the more organized things are the better.I'm going on year 7 and I've tried many things!. First graders definitely need more than the older grades. 

 If the kids know where everything is and can be independent that is ideal and will help greatly with management. Most things I label with their name, but other things I label with their number. I give them each their own little pencil basket at their desk. I include scissors(labeled with their number), glue stick(labeled with their number, 2 pencils, an eraser, and a dry erase marker. 

I also label their HW FOLDER  with their name and  one side is take home, one is bring back. You can make these or look online because they are a ton of free materials!

I label math journals, writing journals, etc. 

I also give them each their own book baggie or reading bin and label it. 

I also make two sets of popsicle sticks with their names. One set is for randomly calling on students or creating random partners, etc. The other set I use for consequences. I set up three little envelopes and put them on a bulletin board. One says warning, one says 5 min out of recess and the third is call home.  The can independently move their popsicle stick to one of the folders when told to do so. I also like using the popsicle sticks because the other students can't see who is in warning, etc.

I also use popsicle sticks (or ones that look like people) for class jobs. I use the small envelopes for each job.  Within the jobs, I include line leader. The line leader is always posted above our door. Each job lasts a week.  

I wouldn't worry too much about the bulletin boards because it is okay if they are blank when you begin the year. I usually have one bulletin board with a sign that says ""welcome first graders"" and then take first day photos of them and put them up on the board. As you begin teaching and they are creating work, you can work on your bulletin boards. 

Is there any chance your district would purchase any books for you or a carpet? We can only have ""fire retardant"" carpets so before you buy anything double check with the school! 

In terms of organization, I have a place for everything and trust me it makes all the difference! I have drawers LABELED (words and picture) for paper clips, post its, lost and found, extra glue sticks, extra highlighters, pencils. 

The kids love flexible seating but I found that it has to be introduced super slowly because they can get a little crazy otherwise! My kids really like the scoop chairs and we use lap desks for writing which they love. 

BUT, like I said.. it takes a while to build up to this. so start with the things that you would need for the first week. Plus, Corona has really made a mess of everything and who knows what the fall will bring! It is good you are thinking about these things now! 

Stores to buy teaching things - TARGET + Dollar Store always have GREAT deals, Michaels, really good stuff, lakeshore 

I'm sure I can think of a lot more, but I hope this is helpful!!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs part of the school‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst 6 Weeks‚Äù plan that we are given a few days prior to school starting.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the advice! Did your school tell you about the ‚Äúease-in‚Äù or did you have to ask?
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! I‚Äôve been buying from used book stores and this is a much better idea!
ElementaryTeachers,"Also, you can use Emotional ABCs on Zoom and show all their videos and printables at no cost to teachers as they offer a Free Teacher account."
ElementaryTeachers,"Literally only brought in some fabric for the bulletin boards and books. My classroom was previously a first grade teacher‚Äôs room and she dipped and left everything (thanks for the scented stamp pads!) Also, my school has this big ‚Äúease-in‚Äù with materials. Teachers have to cover shelves with chart paper; pencils are the only material used the first week. And it‚Äôs literally genius. When you realize you need something - like oh, hey, take a break could really use a rug, get it - but ask the school to buy it first. I‚Äôd recommend just saving money now so that you can get the things you need when you need them."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you need more books, check out your local thrift store. Lot of stores will have good deals on children books."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôll be a first year teacher in the fall, so I still struggle with making new ideas for meetings. I wish that my ideas were more exciting but I have some basic ideas right now!

For greetings: We had a very bad flu bug going around this year (pre-corona) and it got to the point where we did more distant greetings. It‚Äôs not quite the same, but we had the kids do the same greetings with near-touches. For example, they would high-five or fist bump with a few inches between the kids. I imagine that these simple greetings could work with social distance as long as the kids went around the circle in order. We also did a lot of knock-knock greetings and funny voice greetings. I feel like dice greetings could be replicated with technology if the teacher leads everything (like maybe the kids say when to press the button on your phone if there‚Äôs a dice app or something). 

For activities: We would also bend the share/activity dynamic to fit the needs of the day in my class. For example, we would do a read aloud, education YouTube video, or song for a share or activity. We would bend it by saying we‚Äôll listen to x as the activity or I (the teacher) wanted to share x with you today. I also feel like some GoNoodles could be fun activities for social distancing if there was enough space in the classroom. My kids also LOVED Mad Libs when we learned about parts of speech, but I feel like that could work anytime."
ElementaryTeachers,Cute but who‚Äôs going to provide all the flashlights?
ElementaryTeachers,"How about each student has their own personalized flashlight?! When someone's flashlight is lit, it's their turn to share."
ElementaryTeachers,"You're welcome, I am glad that you found this post to be useful!! The bosque escuela sounds interesting, I am sure you will learn a lot there! Good luck with everything!"
ElementaryTeachers,GREAT topic. I‚Äôm curious to see ideas!
ElementaryTeachers,We assigned lessons through Google Classroom. I had to rejig the worksheets so the kids could complete them independently and not require them print the sheets out. Second Step made their program available for home learning as you can send video links and worksheets home.
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve been looking into making my own with bleach and paper towels. There are some YouTube videos about how to do it.
ElementaryTeachers,I've been wondering the same thing.  I imagine it's a good idea to get some wipes and sanitizer just in case.
ElementaryTeachers,Our principal reused the list from last year.
ElementaryTeachers,Ours are banned from our supply list.
ElementaryTeachers,I definitely think they will be hard to find. But my school has been really good at making sure we have a huge supply. I‚Äôd check with your operations folks and see what their plan is.

ElementaryTeachers,Oh wow! Thanks for sharing that!!
ElementaryTeachers,"Here‚Äôs the update: 


Governor Abbott has just released a groundbreaking update, which temporarily allows candidates to be issued an Intern Certificate before passing a content test. This means that candidates enrolled with Texas Teachers can be eligible to receive their one-year Intern Certificate without having to pass the TExES content exam prior to getting hired, until October 1"
ElementaryTeachers,What content test? I haven't heard anything
ElementaryTeachers,Did you hear at they‚Äôre waiving the content test? For fall 2020
ElementaryTeachers,"I'll be teaching Primaria, from 6 to 12 years old. I totally agree with you, despite we could have really good teachers the main methodology of our system is oriented to use books. Thanks for your advice, I'll check about classroom management and also I'm writting down everything I find that could be interesting to apply in class. Also, when this lockdown ends I've planned to study in a Forest School (Bosque Escuela,that is name in spanish), a methodology that started in Germany and is far more dinamic and completely different main traditional methodology.

Thanks a lot!!!!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"No, but I love Second Step. Do you think there'd be confidentiality issues? Hm, I hadn't thought of that."
ElementaryTeachers,"Diversify teaching staff &amp; admin, remove SROs from schools, rewrite curricula, train staff in culturally responsive education and trauma-informed teaching.  But number 1 is STOP FUNDING SCHOOLS WITH REAL ESTATE TAXES.  This keeps poorly funded schools in the neighborhoods that need good schools the most.  We need equity in funding."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey! I totally understand what you are saying because I was an English assistant for 5 years in Spain (I just moved back to USA a few months ago). I found a lot of teachers tended to use very traditional/old fashioned classroom management techniques, although it depended on the teacher. Overall, the Spanish education system is quite traditional though. What age will you be teaching? I found secondary grades 9 eso and 10 eso to be the most difficult, but the other grades were good (I taught from 1st primaria to 2nd bachillerato). I would recommend seeing if you can buy a book on classroom management (in USA classroom management is emphasized a lot). I think it will help. Also maybe you could find a book about different teaching techniques (instead of just completely lecture/book oriented) and different projects and things that you can use in the classroom. Also you could try just googling that information. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"It pretty much is now. It just depends on the district. I would think TEA would just require it from the git go though, because like you said, we are right on the border."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm surprised ESL is not mandatory in Texas since it is right at the border.
ElementaryTeachers,You‚Äôre welcome!
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for the reply!
ElementaryTeachers,"Bilingual will make you very competitive. (I‚Äôm in Houston). And you get paid more for it. Most districts has started requiring ESL, so bilingual would be better if it‚Äôs something you can certify in."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! It went well. All the pointers made me a tad more confident than I would‚Äôve been otherwise. Writing stuff down on a sticky next to the camera works!
ElementaryTeachers,"Are you an elementary school educator/administrator or the parent/guardian of an elementary school student whose school has shifted to online learning in the face of COVID-19?

Please consider participating in an online research study through the University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison. 

The study investigates the shift from traditional classroom learning to online learning because of COVID-19. The results will assist in determining overall impact to elementary teachers, administrators, and families. An additional focus will be placed on equity of access to technology and to provide guidance for future transitions to online learning. 

Survey completion averages 15 minutes. At the end, you will be invited to share your contact information should you volunteer to participate in a 30-minute virtual interview to be scheduled at a later date. Educators will be invited to anonymously share materials that have been created specifically for online learning. You may choose to participate in as much or as little as you feel comfortable."
ElementaryTeachers,"I just saw this, but I hope it went well!!! I‚Äôm also an introvert and HATE interviewing.

I like to prepare answers for questions I anticipate ahead of time and I‚Äôve even put my answers next to me during interviews. I don‚Äôt read from my notes, but I‚Äôll glance down and make sure I said everything I wanted to. Nobody has ever said anything about it before, but if they had I was just planning on saying that I put a lot of thought into my answers and wanted to make sure that I fully conveyed my ideas.

Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to pause and think about your answer. I used to feel like I had to start talking immediately after a question and then I would catch myself saying stupid things that I wouldn‚Äôt have if I took a moment to process. Once I learned to slow down, I was better at more eloquently stating my answer. I also like to keep a bottle of water with me at interviews so I can take a sip and give myself a moment to collect my thoughts.

Zoom can seem awkward and intimidating at first, but focus on the advantages- you can be in a comfortable setting during your interview and you can hide the feed from everybody else on the panel except whoever is asking the question at the time. I hate having a table full of people staring at me üò≥"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have any specific say x or make sure you do y, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got this and even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it, it‚Äôs just the nerves. I‚Äôm sure it will go well! And, after your interview, if you think of something you had wanted to say or ask, write it down for the second interview round!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for replying. That‚Äôs excellent advice. I am interviewing them too-good point. Thank you for also including questions for me to ask them, especially about COVID."
ElementaryTeachers,"As an introvert, you have an advantage of it being on zoom. Call a friend on zoom beforehand, this will help you make sure your mic and camera are working, but also give you a warm up to talking into a computer! Also, get yourself a bottle of water in case you need a few extra seconds in replying and it helps with nerves. I say bottle because frankly, I‚Äôm a lil clumsy when I‚Äôm nervous and a cup sounds dangerous. Also, remember you‚Äôre interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you! Ask them what steps they‚Äôve taken to support students and staff during co-vid and what plans they have in place for next school year, especially if distance learning is continuing in the fall, but also what plans they have to re-acclimate students to school."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm not sure if the ESL is just for elementary or if it covers EC-12. I took it back in 2013.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, and its definitely not like that IRL but you'll love it anyway üòÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,Haha I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúperfect world‚Äù scenario so much from my coworkers. Thanks for the tip üôÇ
ElementaryTeachers,Oh I see.well if you have any questions feel free to ask! I'll try to help the best I can üòÅ thank you and best of luck to you too!!
ElementaryTeachers,Yeah I went a different route since my degree is not in education. I‚Äôm doing the alternative certification program (ACP) with Texas teachers of Tomorrow. They won‚Äôt approve you to take my PPR until you start the intern year. And good for you!! I wish you the best of luck with the content. I‚Äôm using 240tutoring to study and it‚Äôs great! üëçüèª
ElementaryTeachers,"The PPR was really easy by the way. I was able to read the book in a day and took the test a week after. There were only a few things (mostly the ELL's info) that I focused mostly on. My university stressed everything is in a ""perfect world"", and it was so that should also help with the elimination process üôÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,"On fb it's a private group under 

TExES Test Prep: LOTE-Spanish &amp; BTLPT


Yes I've already passed the PPR. Honestly everything I studied in the book was pretty much what was on the test, including stuff for ELL's. 
I'm not sure about being hired without it. In my university I had to pass my PPR and content before even doing student teaching."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yay! Great news! Thanks for sharing and please, if you don‚Äôt mind, go ahead and share the fb page.

Do you have your PPR passed yet? We could still be hired without that one during our intern year, correct?"
ElementaryTeachers,"No, not sad at all!! Listen, sometimes we are too close to a situation to see it clearly. When my son was having a hard time potty training, I was saying to one of my coworkers- ‚ÄúI have no idea how to get through to him!‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúHave you tried a sticker chart?‚Äù It never even crossed my mind to use something so simple, that I‚Äôd used a million times before! It worked, too- of courseüòÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,I see what you mean. How sad I never thought of that. I will do that tomorrow.
ElementaryTeachers,I think specifically teaching the behavior you expect and then practicing it- just like you would teach and then practice a math skill- is key.
ElementaryTeachers,"I've tried using a chime, clapping or a saying for them to repeat for weeks. It's not working right away."
ElementaryTeachers,"I would choose some sort of signal that I‚Äôd use every time. I have a chime I use, but a bell, a song, anything. Then I would do a mini lesson on what the behavior expectation is when I, for example, ring the bell. ‚ÄúEvery time you hear this bell, your going to freeze and look at me for instructions.‚Äù Then I‚Äôd have them pretend like they were working in partners or small groups, chatting, and have them practice freezing and looking at me everytime I ring the bell. Then, practice with the bell LOTS throughout the day for the first week, even when you don‚Äôt need to tell them anything specific- just say ‚ÄúThank you so much for following our bell procedure!‚Äù Maybe give some sort of class prize or something. Eventually, they will associate the bell with getting quiet and they will be able to do it without even thinking about it!"

ElementaryTeachers,How would you practice getting the class to be quiet?
ElementaryTeachers,"Look up some YouTube videos on Whole Brain Teaching- that can be very effective if you‚Äôre having a hard time getting their attention. Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to go back to basics. If there is a procedure they aren‚Äôt getting, practice it until they do. For example, they need to line up quietly but they are lining up like a stampede of elephants. Have them sit down and practice lining up again. And again. And again until they get it. They are smart enough that they will probably only have to be late to recess or specials once or twice before they realize they should just line up quietly the first time!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I wouldn‚Äôt have a petting zoo. It‚Äôd be difficult to manage. Plus, what if a child had an unexpected allergic reaction? (Happened to me once in the classroom ‚Äî the child nor the parents knew he was allergic.)"
ElementaryTeachers,"If pets are there, a pet show? Every kid‚Äôs pet gets a prize for categories like fluffiest, whitest, friendliest, scaliest...if you divide by age groups you won‚Äôt have to think of so many. 
Without a pet...decorate a dog treat? Buy milk bones and find a dog friendly frosting that kids can decorate with. Have someone do directed drawings for how to draw a puppy, a kitty, a bunny, a fish...maybe there is a local company that brings puppies for birthday parties....there‚Äôs one in my area. Or pony rides? Show an oldie but goldie movie like the Aristocats or Lady and the Tramp or 101 Dalmatians. Put together a pet gift basket...one for dogs, one for cats...and have a raffle."
ElementaryTeachers,Hope and Wade King did something called Toy Story STEAM Mania. Here is another teacher‚Äôs rendition of it: https://www.sweetestteacher.com/blog-2/2018/10/9/toy-story-steam-mania You could break it into multiple parts and have teachers decorate to fit the theme.
ElementaryTeachers,"That's really cute! I will most definitely run this by the principal. In case he says no to the family pets, do you think this would work with just the petting zoo? What do else do you think would be cool to add without the family pet?"
ElementaryTeachers,"A pet night? Have a photo booth with pets, a local vet who will let kids listen to their pet‚Äôs hearts or something, a petting zoo...maybe you can find a local trainer who can demonstrate dog agility or something, a dance with your pets, a station for making pet paw prints next to a child‚Äôs handprints..."
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe only have certain ages do certain activities. Slime and lego-based activities could be for kinder-grade 2 and escape rooms for grades 3-5.
ElementaryTeachers,"My oldest is in kindergarten. So these nights are new to me. Is that what these nights usually are? Just think of a theme, and create 6-8 activity stations? Do you know, how do I make it interesting for such a wide age gap?

Any guidance would be helpful."
ElementaryTeachers,"I love this idea, but we need to keep it all on campus. Maybe we can do the scavenger hunt on campus with riddles, and then each one leads to a station for something. If they complete they win a prize.

I was also hoping to think if something kind of like the telescope for astronomy night because that was a big draw. Just to use the telescope. But I can't think of a parallel but different activity."
ElementaryTeachers,"How about a car rally? Like a scavenger hunt with cars...Start and end at the school, give them a page of clues, they have to take a picture at each location on the route...I did one recently for a charity my daughter belongs to and it was a hit!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Host a STEM night. You could have multiple escape rooms, a slime making area, and other activities that are stem related. It‚Äôd be fun and they‚Äôd be learning."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"Sparkle Boy, The Recess Queen, The Invisible Boy, Those Shoes, The Can Man, Wonder"
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks! I'll try doing that with some of the things I can disinfect. Sadly I cant really do anything about moist or slimy supplies I find on the floor...
ElementaryTeachers,Bleh! Get well soon.
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching isn‚Äôt for everyone. Personally I love it, but I work with teachers who wish they‚Äôd chosen a different path. I teach grades 3 and 4 and have been an elementary teacher for thirteen years. I plan on retiring a teacher in fifteen years. I agree with the comment about working for adequate pay. Would I be a teacher for $30 000/yr - no. That‚Äôs a standard of living choice. If you‚Äôre constantly worried about paying the bills you can‚Äôt really be happy in anything you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm lucky to work in a region that pays teachers very well. So my advice is look into teacher pay in your area.

Here are some traits to consider:
1. Are you comfortable talking in front of people? And can you be entertaining doing it? That comes first because you need to project confidence for classroom management. Your life will be hell if you don‚Äôt have classroom management skills.
2. Are you patient? Do you get annoyed when people keep asking you the same question?
3. You‚Äôre going to need to be an educator but also a social worker and caregiver.
4. Are you creative? You can find A LOT of lesson ideas online but you need to have some skill at making stuff up yourself.
5. Are you organized but equally ok throwing your plans out the window? You need to be flexible and read your audience.
6. Are you compassionate? What I have learned is the #1 thing parents care about is that they‚Äôre child is happy at school. Remember, when you talk to parents you‚Äôre talking to them about the most important thing (sorry no better word) in the life. Always start with the positive.
7. Do you like kids? I put this last because I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs about ‚Äúliking kids‚Äù. I think being a good teacher has more to do with being compassionate, caring and empathetic. If that‚Äôs the type of person you are, then that‚Äôs how you will treat your students. When you start teaching, you may work a year in kindergarten then a year in grade 8. It‚Äôs more about your respectful treatment of others. 

Hope that helps."
ElementaryTeachers,"Conversations around books that are at his instructional level can be just as impactful, if not more, than printed comprehension questions. Perhaps your child‚Äôs teacher can provide books to take home and/or questions you can focus on at home to help with this. If not, there are free downloads for sets of questions kids are expected to answer at each reading level through various sights online. Pinterest would be a good resource for this."
ElementaryTeachers,Oh my gosh. I also teach elementary and I have been so sick this year too.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, it‚Äôs a first year thing. You‚Äôll start building an immunity."
ElementaryTeachers,"I always use hand sanitizer after finishing up a class! I also keep lotion on stand by since it can kinda dry out your hands washing them/using hand sanitizer so often. 
I also use disinfecting wipes on doorknobs, door frames, light switches, water fountains, and other commonly touched items. I've even seen some teachers squirt hand sanitizer in the children's hand as they enter! It gives time for the class to file in more organized and easier for you to give directions as they enter. 
Health wise, drink water all the time. A woman I know recommends Vitamin C supplements as well, but of course consult a doctor beforehand!"
ElementaryTeachers,Grin and bear it
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs entirely true. I have students that I had to work backwards with because of this, too. 

To me, as a first year teacher, the most effective way to handle management is to ONLY give attention to good behavior. Someone shouts out the answer? Ignore it and praise the quiet hand you call on. A student won‚Äôt stop talking? Compliment each student around them that isn‚Äôt. This works best with an incentive program such as clipping up/down or stickers for positive behavior."
ElementaryTeachers," There's addressing the issue, and there's traumatizing two small children, though.  Any hour long interrogation without parents present seems excessive.   Yes,  it's important to determine what is actually going on, but that's not how you go about doing so."
ElementaryTeachers,I teach third grade ELA. I work in a TAP school so they micromanage ALL of my time. There is no time to do anything at school. Between meetings and parent conferences all of my ‚Äúplanning‚Äù time is eaten up with other things.
ElementaryTeachers,Wow. What do you teach? It's still taking up your time outside of work?
ElementaryTeachers,Going on 16 years.
ElementaryTeachers,How long have you been teaching?
ElementaryTeachers,I barely have time for anything personal. It sucks!
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you! I did just that, talked it out with my room moms and then my teammate. We are all on the same page now. It has been a whirlwind. I have only had a few days where I have left school feeling confident about the next day.  I am hopeful that things will eventually ‚Äúclick‚Äù for me. Thank you for the advice!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Start from scratch. Tell them that you are going back to talk about expectations and consequences and role play what students should be doing and the positive and negative consequences depending on if they follow the rules.   And stick by what you say. 
I really recommend 1,2,3 magic to help you enforce consequences. It helps me keep it fair, gives students a chance to fix themselves. 
Make sure you behavior plans focus on specific behaviors and make the goal easy to reach for the first few days to get student buy-in.  Let them work up to higher goals gradually."
ElementaryTeachers,"Take a deep breath. Wait until your emotions have completely settled. Then have an honest conversation. 
Also, I just want to say thank you. Teachers are hard working, talented, nurturing geniuses. First year teachers have the toughest time but know that you are appreciated and it will all be better soon."
ElementaryTeachers,"We try to only keep the kids in for about half their recess time IF they choose not to work during classtime.  If they truly don't understand the material after a whole group lesson, I think it's our job as educators to pull them aside to revisit and reach the subject matter whether that be cutting a whole group lesson short to work with them or pulling them during classroom rotations/station work."
ElementaryTeachers,Speaker phone!!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! So happy you enjoy your job!
ElementaryTeachers,You‚Äôre quite welcome
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach 2nd and we always cover author‚Äôs purpose; it‚Äôs a CCSS. Have you looked on TPT? There are lots of grade-appropriate things. One thing I always use is an Author‚Äôs Purpose PowerPoint I got on TPT by Rachel Lynette. She has 32 slides that cover all of PIE, and my kids love reading them and guessing which purpose it is. There are so many great activities to pick and choose from on TPT!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I absolutely love my job. I teach 4th grade. It is time consuming, paperwork filled, filled with people who don't make the job easy.....but at the end of the day when those kids take your hand or ask if you would eat lunch with them you know that your making a difference. When you see them light up because they learned something new and exciting is when I know I am in the right profession. 

You do not become a teacher for the money or the breaks. You become a teacher for the kids."
ElementaryTeachers,Ooh these are a lot of great ideas! Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"We usually don‚Äôt teach it until third or fourth quarter, so good luck to you. I introduced it, and then I introduced PIE‚Äôd (persuade, inform, entertain, describe). Maybe you could do an activity with slices of pie. Anyway, You could also use this video as an activity: https://youtu.be/Tg8nFoniSjs This would help them to know exactly which slice of pie they‚Äôre dealing with. Finally, read something like Robins! How They Grow Up or My Awesome Summer by P. Mantis. They could do a reading response by answering, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the author‚Äôs purpose? Use key details from the text and 5-7 sentences to answer.‚Äù You could check it later. Both of these books are challenging because they give facts, but they also tell a story. I would say that the author‚Äôs purpose would be to inform for both of them. This is because there‚Äôs more information given than entertainment. If you have access to Flocabulary they have an awesome catchy song about Author‚Äôs Purpose. I hope this helps you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"My son did something similar at four with another boy in preschool, joking around in the bathroom. His teacher told me, which I answered ‚Äúoh, boys are so grossss‚Äù where we all kinda chuckled. But I still had an important talk with my son about privacy and your private area. These girls are 8 and know better, it shouldn‚Äôt seem like the end of the world but it should be addressed. It is important to know if one is touching another‚Äôs privates in the bathroom when one is going potty. That seems like something that could send red flags and as a parent I would really want to know the truth about that type of issue. I wouldn‚Äôt blame her for not being completely casual about it depending on how it all progressed and how she found them and all."
ElementaryTeachers,"As a kindergarten teacher I have to say I absolutely hate this mentality.  If a student is struggling to keep up with work, why would you make them work for 7 hours straight? I know I lose focus without breaks, I find it hard to imagine a kid who doesn‚Äôt react the same way to a day with no breaks. Ditto withholding recess for behavior- if you are struggling to do the right thing before recess, what‚Äôs gonna happen to the rest of your day if you are stuck inside while everybody else plays? 

If students are making choices that are unsafe (or occasionally choices that are unkind) they have to sit out for a break but other than that I don‚Äôt touch their recess time.   

Where I currently teach we are legally required to provide students with 30 minutes of recess. It used to be a parent could give permission to take recess but this year we were told that recess is a right regardless of parental permission. I‚Äôm a huge advocate for this policy - kids need a break!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Some schools in our area require us to give our students at least 20 minutes. Unless I‚Äôm taking recess time from the whole class, I don‚Äôt take it away from a singular student. It can lead to them feeling ashamed, singled-out, and resentful"
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve read this has bad results in scholarly articles for my classes, but idk about it practiced today in personal experiences. In a kindergarten class I observed, the teacher had written parental permission to take recess time when a girl would not work past her frustration and do an ounce of writing work. This student also had a schedule and a smiley next to work she would complete on the list of activities for the day. These were methods used to make her complete work and she had command over the class behaviorally with positive reinforcements and other means. I remember kids losing it when I was in elementary from early-mid 90‚Äôs."
ElementaryTeachers,"yes it's widespread,idk a teacher that doesn't do this considering some kids ant stay after/come in early."
ElementaryTeachers,"The job can be difficult and frustrating at times, but it is definitely rewarding. I teach 3rd and 4th grade and seeing kids get excited about learning and giving them a place where they can express their creativity/intelligence and learn new things is incredible. It‚Äôs not perfect by any means, but if you are passionate about making a difference, it‚Äôs a fantastic experience and very much worth everything else that come with it."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the raw advice &amp; keeping it real.
ElementaryTeachers,"My advice is find a different profession. The pros are interacting with students and leading them down their education journey. 

The cons... endless paperwork, not being able to save everyone of everything, budget cuts, district plans and initiatives that don‚Äôt match own beliefs. Don‚Äôt try and get some one to tell you, ‚ÄúOh you don‚Äôt do it for the money.‚Äù The fuck, yes I do, I have to eat and provide for my family at the end of the day it is an important and critical task for the survival and continuation of us, but if I could go back after seven years and change my major go something else I would. 

The education system is broken and no one is taking a stand to fix it including myself and the glory and pride you feel those first couple of years and times dissipated to dust when you have to deal with parents who don‚Äôt care, parents who don‚Äôt stick around, parents who baby their kids, parents who are overly arrogant about their student, parents who are blaming you all the time as the reason why their student can‚Äôt function. Plus politics that make no damn sense. 

Don‚Äôt walk, run to the nearest exit, did I mention also the meaningless raise of
200 dollars a year every two years, then you don‚Äôt have tenure, everything is under a microscope, and if you want to make more money than that you have to go into more debt pursuing another degree just to make money to pay back your fucking debt."
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh no problem, it's sounds way more confusing than it actually is. You'll do great in this class, I'm sure of it!"
ElementaryTeachers,This sounds so confusing. Hopefully you have a good teacher or are naturally good at math where this comes easier to you. Thanks for the specific math example.
ElementaryTeachers,"What is 14 in base 8 diveded by 3 in base 8. Base 8 refers to blocks (typically the base times itself), longs (just the base unit), and a unit which would be one. So to get the answer to this the 10s spot would be 8 and the 4 would be just 4. You would divide these up into 3 equal groups till they are all even, despite a remainder. So you'd have 9 base 8 with a remainder of 3.  (I'm currently in this class)"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the example and the kind words!
ElementaryTeachers,"I was in college about ten years ago so I‚Äôm sure a lot has changed since then and I can‚Äôt remember much about my elementary math course. The one thing that does stand out in my mind is learning a numeric system that is base five. Our numeric system is base ten, meaning that each place value is ten times more than the last (tens=onesx10, hundreds=tensx10, thousands=hundredsx10 and so on). In college we had to do problems that were in base 5. Essentially the only digits to exist in this system are 0,1,2,3,4. So each place value is now  five times greater than the last. You would count 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 100...

Some examples of problems would be 
4+2=11
14+14=33
31+42=123
100-2=43
42-23=14

The logic in learning this type of numeric system is so you can struggle and understand how children feel when they are first learning our number system. It is so ingrained in us by the time we are in college it can be easy to take this knowledge for granted. 

I hope this helped and good luck in your studies! I absolutely adore teaching. There is seriously no better profession!!"
ElementaryTeachers,Haha! I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has concerns about this stuff!!!
ElementaryTeachers,"3rd grade teacher here! I‚Äôve been teaching for 16 years, and my first year or two, this was a really normal feeling for me. The more you teach, the more confidence you‚Äôll gain. It‚Äôs ok to feel overwhelmed and unsure- it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve done anything wrong! 

So a couple pieces of advice to help you in the moment of feeling overwhelmed-

1. It‚Äôs ok to not know the answer to a question a student asks- I‚Äôm always honest if I don‚Äôt know and use that as a teaching moment. ‚ÄúWow, what a great question! I don‚Äôt know the answer to that, does anyone else?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to look into that for you!‚Äù

2. It‚Äôs ok to make a mistake! Again, use it to teach students that EVERYONE makes mistakes, even grownups, so they know it‚Äôs ok when THEY make a mistake.

3. If you are by yourself and need a moment to collect your thoughts or just breathe, ask a question and have students ‚Äúturn and talk‚Äù about it, or have them partner up and read through a passage of something. Once you‚Äôve gathered yourself, bring the class back together for a discussion.

Remember, you don‚Äôt have to be perfect! Teachers are people, too. Looking back, I think a lot of my overwhelm in the beginning was a fear of not being enough. But as long as you‚Äôre showing up prepared and present with your students, and you‚Äôre willing to learn from your mistakes, you are doing just fine!!

And it gets easier- I promise!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Use getepic.com. There are hundreds of free digital books. Some have quizzes and some don‚Äôt, but you could use the ones that have quizzes. There is a membership fee."
ElementaryTeachers,Try Readworks. Or go to Lakeshore or some other teacher store and order comprehension books at that level.
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm a little late to reply. Have you checked out WGU? They have degrees in elementary ed and it is self paced. I have a bachelors in General Studies and I am looking into subbing and enrolling in WGU. I have heard very good things as far as gaining employment after graduating. It is a really affordable option, too. You pay by term so the faster you can complete it, the better."
ElementaryTeachers,I'm not a teacher yet but working on getting my cert! Wondering how you got into Ed Tech? Sounds fun! (Maybe?)
ElementaryTeachers,"This depends on your state as well. As a teacher from California, there are a multitude of tests that must be passed first (CBEST, CSET, RICA etc) and either an internship or student teaching program.

Most people I know have just gotten their bachelors in child development or liberal studies and begun teaching as substitutes. Then they joined a credential program and earned their credential as they teach.

Many universities have programs where you earn your masters and credential simultaneously."
ElementaryTeachers,Another question; what about elementary music teaching? I love music a ton (and english ) and would be fine working either regular 1st grade or something music inclined!!
ElementaryTeachers,"You‚Äôre welcome! Starting with one is wise! I was that crazy teacher that did them each for one day on a Friday We have interventions on all of the other days and Fridays were more flexible for me, so I would set up on Thursday after school and take down on Friday after school. I plan to do more elaborate ones this year, so I may set up for the entire week! Best wishes! I hope you have a blast! üòç"
ElementaryTeachers,I think I just want to start with one this year. üòÖ Thank you for the advice! Did you keep your transformation up for like a week? That‚Äôs what I was thinking about doing.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve done several transformations with my second graders! My advice is to expect it to be crazy! Lol! Give clear expectations and enjoy! I LOVE seeing how the students interact with the materials and how excited they get! Let them struggle a bit to problem solve before stepping in with little hints. I find that transformations are so rewarding for me as a teacher and for the students! I just had Meet the Teacher yesterday and the little brother of a girl I had last year is in my class now. Their mom was telling all of the parents what a wonderful and amazing teacher I was and that I do all of these awesome things. I was so touched that she felt that way. I did a LOT of transformations and break outs last year. It‚Äôs a lot of work initially, but there is a HUGE payoff! Go for it!"
ElementaryTeachers,I saved a lot of last year‚Äôs Scholastic Book  Fair decorations (theme was dinosaurs ) with a similar room transformation in mind. What holds me back is that the entire budget for such a thing would be out-of-pocket for me. My school won‚Äôt pay for something like that. Trying to figure out a way to approach parents for donations....
ElementaryTeachers,Sent you a message!  Please check :)
ElementaryTeachers,I'd love to try it out if it's appropriate for first graders!
ElementaryTeachers,Hi! That's very nice to know :) can you please inbox me your work email address?
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm a 4th grade teacher and would love to give it look over.
ElementaryTeachers,"College student aspiring to become a teacher here! I see you mentioned at the end that you want to demonstrate that you love kids and how you want to work with them, but think about the other applicants; they are probably putting across the same energy and passion to work with kids as you. I think it‚Äôs also important that you demonstrate your understanding about child development and the importance of laying foundational knowledge in their early years. Also shifting your love and how you want to work with them to how you want to make a difference in their lives and be able to guide them so that they can make the right decisions in the now and in the future. You don‚Äôt want to look like a candidate that just wants to have fun with kids, but a candidate that has a mature perspective of their role as an educator."
ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, a backpack. I ditched the bag in year 2 and my shoulders thanked me."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve used this bag from Duluth Trading for the past 4 school years and it holds up great! The straps are long enough that it fits nicely under my arm and it can hold quite a lot. 

[the bag ](https://www.duluthtrading.com/womens-canvas-travel-tote-bag-84703.html?dwvar_84703_color=BBY&amp;cgid=duluth-gear-bags-travel-totes&amp;ev3=#start=2&amp;cgid=duluth-gear-bags-travel-totes)"
ElementaryTeachers,"My school is letting me use choice boards instead of videos of me teaching a few times a week so that I‚Äôm available to help support HR teachers. If you‚Äôre looking for other sources, try looking up choice boards related to your topic."
ElementaryTeachers,"SeeSaw is far more accessible for the age group. The first graders I worked with for distance learning at the end of last school year had to use Google classroom for their art and music work. They could not figure it out. Their parents struggled with it as well, and it just made for a huge headache for everyone involved. We used SeeSaw for our class, and it seemed to be far more accessible for the kids."
ElementaryTeachers,I say Google Classroom just because it's easier to place something like a Bitmoji room in with all the resources into and make that the main place
ElementaryTeachers,Seesaw is great for primary.
ElementaryTeachers,Check out /r/ArtEd for some ideas and art related convo.
ElementaryTeachers,I used Seesaw with my first graders and it went fairly well. Kids/parents took it on easily and seemed to have a good time with it. Seesaw also has an activity page where other teaches share their lessons. Made it super easy to include some more fun activities on top of our daily mains.
ElementaryTeachers,"I was thinking to use it more in small group video sessions, but you could assign it to each student and add text boxes or have them install the mote app for oral responses to do on google slides"
ElementaryTeachers,"I consider myself a social worker/educator. You can teach with an MSW- private schools will hire you without a teaching degree or credential. I started as an assistant teacher and became the head teacher for a 3/4 grade combined class. Because of burnout I can‚Äôt see myself teaching for an extended period, but it‚Äôs the most fun job I have ever had and I plan to go back to it at different points in my career to change pace and have a respite from community mental health and paperwork."
ElementaryTeachers,Yes. It feels overwhelming not knowing exactly what to do and school is starting in a few weeks!
ElementaryTeachers,"I am an elementary art teacher....we know we are remote only, but that‚Äôs about it. It is crazy."
ElementaryTeachers,"Does this record the answers, and can students look at each others wheels to see their answers?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yeah! And depending on how your local org is operating the program, the students will either receive a virtual Pillowcase and workbook at a physical set to take home, which is also fun :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yeah! And depending on how your local org is operating the program, the students will either receive a virtual Pillowcase and workbook at a physical set to take home, which is also fun :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Love this! I hadn‚Äôt really thought of discussing preparedness, but I really dig it and think it‚Äôll make taking about scarier things a lot easier if we have a plan for them! Looks like they have a lot of digital materials available, too."
ElementaryTeachers,You may want to look into the Pillowcase Project from the American Red Cross. They talk about different natural weather events and how to prepare for them. It's super empowering for your students age range!
ElementaryTeachers,"I find that since I was not good at math growing up and struggled quite a bit that I understood students misconceptions easier. I feel it has made me understand those students better, so I can help them learn."
ElementaryTeachers,"I am a resource teacher (called learning support in some areas). For my job specifically, I like being able to work with the students in smaller groups. I also like being able to co-teach with general education teachers so that I can work with all the students sometimes as well. It‚Äôs a great age because they are still cute and innocent but have developed a pretty good sense of humor! 

What you teach depends on what you apply for. Each school is different in how they do their staffing. For example, the first school I worked at, the students all had one teacher for the whole day, all subjects. The school I am at now departmentalizes in 4th and 5th grades, so they have 2-3 teachers. It‚Äôs a great question to ask during the interview stage so you know exactly what you are applying for. Keep in mind that assignments can be changed if needed, but that is anywhere."
ElementaryTeachers,"3rd-5th grade is just about the age range I‚Äôd like to teach! What are some of your favorite things about it? Also do new teachers get to choose what specific grade they want to teach or do we sort of just have to find openings somewhere? 
(I‚Äôm assuming that it really depends on the time place you live but the process is all a mystery to me right now)"
ElementaryTeachers,Wow thank you all so much for the reassurance! I‚Äôm so excited to become a teacher but sometimes my imposter syndrome gets loud. At the end of the day I know I‚Äôm joining a wonderful community.
ElementaryTeachers,"You will be taking classes about how to teach math when you earn your credential plus most teacher guides explains the concepts and teaching method. You'll probably need to put in some extra time studying the lessons beforehand and work with your grade level teachers to help you. 

Your math anxiety is actually a strength! Make sure to tell your class that you struggled with math when you were their age and that hard work, a growth mindset, and practice helped you overcome your fears - so much so that you became a teacher! I was the same way with writing when I was in elementary school and I tell my young writers how much I struggled. It puts the struggling students at ease and gives them confidence that they can overcome their feeling of inadequacy through hard work and your help, of course."
ElementaryTeachers,2 truths and a lie would work well. Charades could also be fun. You could also play what's different
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm sorry you haven‚Äôt received a response on this. I think students can actively engage in problem solving digitally, and it‚Äôs something they already know well (thanks, vidya games.)
I think the format for student discovery needs to be shifted; we aren‚Äôt manipulating materials in class, but we can do simpler activities at home or find virtual manipulatives. 

If you‚Äôre trying to find solutions for a specific problem students are working to solve, I‚Äôd be more than happy to brainstorm with you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Same! Here‚Äôs the thing though, I literally went up to my math methods professor at the end of class one day and had to ask her if she would be willing to teach me how to divide. No one told me division was just repeated subtraction; they just kept saying it was the opposite of multiplication and that was taught as just memorizing facts. 

So here‚Äôs the thing, I learned math again using curriculum books for 3rd and 4th grade. And, it finally made sense. In student teaching, my gifted group of second graders could figure out the problems faster than I could and sometimes I just had them show their thinking or explain how they got their answers and, ‚ÄúWow. What a great way to explain your thinking. Let‚Äôs move on to the next problem.‚Äù

Two years ago my position got switched a month into the school year and I was teaching math as a remedial math teacher to third and fourth. I hated it, but man, let me tell you, I can explain why you move the decimal points, where the random zero comes from when you multiply, and pretty much everything all K-4 math standards. 

My point is, if you have a math curriculum, you‚Äôll just learn it as you teach it and absolutely rock it. Don‚Äôt worry! You‚Äôll have bigger ‚ÄúI feel inadequate‚Äù feelings than math once you get into it, and you just learn as you go."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi!! I'm a senior in Elementary Education and I had the EXACT same fear. Younger math? I was amazing at it! Higher levels? Nope. Couldn't do it. I was convinced it was going to absolutely break my educational career. The good news is that your education college should have classes you'll go through that basically reteach you the math taught in elementary schools. Once you master them, you can teach them a lot easier. 

My college had us go through two math classes that did this. We re-learned the concepts using simpler terms and did a couple practice problems. We had to solve the problems and explain every single step in written format, where a teacher would point out where our wording is confusing or identify where we went wrong. Our tests even had sections where we would identify where a imaginary student went wrong on a problem. These classes were extensive when it came to understanding the concept of mathematics, which made it way easier to explain. 

I used to HATE math and was convinced I would never be able to teach it, even to smaller children. Two classes completely changed my mind and now I lean towards wanting to teach math!"
ElementaryTeachers,I also struggled with math as a kid. I didn‚Äôt even know how to do standard algorithm multiplication. I was terrified. But I have taught 4th/5th for 3 years and reteaching myself really made me a better teacher. Just remember to promote a growth mindset and don‚Äôt give your students hidden messages about math.
ElementaryTeachers,"My district is starting the year online, but I've been thinking about this a lot. I think a face mask and shield combo is a good option. Scrubs if you can find them and are allowed to wear them! I'm personally wary of gloves, because it seems like you'd potentially just be spreading more germs around, but that's not based on scientific evidence."
ElementaryTeachers,Good idea! Ergonomic stuff for a sedentary life...or standing desk life.
ElementaryTeachers,"My district gave students an option of face-to-face, 2 online options, or homeschool. Teachers are still going back soon. Being that I teach at a Title 1 school, I‚Äôm expecting most of my students to be coming back. But none-the-less teachers will he expected to teach virtually and face-to-face simultaneously"
ElementaryTeachers,"You‚Äôre going back in person? To a full classroom? 

I teach in Texas and we are online for at least the first 4 weeks and after that the classes are halved and on alternating days."
ElementaryTeachers,Magic Playdoh?
ElementaryTeachers,"Our school is recommending a mask and a shield. A shield alone is not effective. I would think two masks is outstanding, considering the fact that those creepy littledroplets containing the virus can get through just about anything."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for sharing.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, distance learning for at least the first half of the quarter. You had commented on my post where I was looking for DL resources."
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm hoping to do some more soon. Will you be teaching online?
ElementaryTeachers,Love this!!!!
ElementaryTeachers,This is such a great idea and resource! Thank you for this suggestion!
ElementaryTeachers,This is great! It‚Äôs so versatile! All you have to do is change the questions and it can be used in any subject area.
ElementaryTeachers,I feel strongly the foundation to writing is oral language! Speaking and writing are reciprocals. I build oral language through experience and conversation. It helps get kids excited to write and then read their own work or their peers for fun. For the beginning of the year you could use these digital color wheels and then have them write about a classmate or themselves/ and answer.

ElementaryTeachers,Games! I have a digital spinner set you can have! Just download the pdf. I created it with ESL in mind but it works for anyone. Hoping it makes them want to keep logging on if we keep it engaging from the beginning. Also use it to plan around their interests and cultures. [digital color wheel spinners ](bit.ly/l4lfreebie)
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm planning on ordering a lab coat. It‚Äôs not as great as the suggestion of scrubs, which can be washed in hot water, but I‚Äôm teaching science and feel it‚Äôs a more appropriate uniform."
ElementaryTeachers,"Maybe your birthday suit. Can you get unemployment if you‚Äôre fired? But really, I‚Äôm hearing a minimum of two masks. Anyone else hearing that?"
ElementaryTeachers,"They have already set up Google classrooms for elementary students.   We received instructions on logging in and the general ins and outs for virtual learning as a contingency. My only concern with going virtual is figuring out child care for days i have to go in to work.  Most days I'll be able to telework, but some tasks require my presence."
ElementaryTeachers,"Also, doc prescribed antibiotics. Nor sure if that was the cure,  but he was Fever free without meds for over 24hrs so he was cleared for school."
ElementaryTeachers,"TL:Dr: they had a great day. I still have qualms,  but I'm much more relaxed than I was last night.  Thanks for your reassurances and for sharing your experiences and wisdom. 


Today's experience with some policy details: 

Drop off was a cluster this morning.  Car rider line was 1.5mi long and growing when i got there.  I don't envy those in decision making positions.  So much pressure.  It was slow,  but effective. There were student volunteers walking kindergarteners to their classes. Someone the boy knows (a 5th grader) escorted him to his first day at big school.  He was fine.  The girl knew where she was going. 2nd grade!  Staff were positioned to direct traffic just in case.  

The boy's class had lunch in their room.   The girl dined picnic style.  

They sat siblings together on the bus.  The girl reports that there were fewer passengers than last year.  I leave work at 4:30 so they get off at an afterschool (daycare). 

Half of kindergarten attended today to get acclimated.  The other half will go tomorrow, and they will have full classes Friday.  

Yesterday the Governor mandated that teachers and students are to wear masks at all times.  Prior to that announcement they were able to take them off in the class room as long as they were spaced out, and don them any time they were unable to distance such as in common areas and whilst working in groups. The girl's classroom has clear partitions on each desk; Tiny, transparent cubicles in which they are able to free the face.  Recess and PE were also bare faced. 

Classrooms will be fogged with some sort of disinfectant every evening.  

I'm an environmental scientists.  Our lab will begin COVID testing on surfaces in the next few weeks.  Our testing will be limited to tribal organizations and schools on the reservation where I work,  but I may do some ""training"" at my kids' school. 

We all survived day 1.   The last 5 months have been surreal.  

Any suggestions on washing cloth masks without destroying them?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Honestly, if I were you, I would prepare to job hunt. I'd walk up to my admin and ask who is going to protect me if while I keep coming to school, a kid gets sick? Or it's worth it to walk in there with a lawyer to discuss what changes need to occur."
ElementaryTeachers,"School is going to be very strange. Teachers will do what ever they can to make sure students are safe. A big thing we follow is the Maslow hierarchy of needs. 

As for Virtual days, I would say try and find a buddy family that you can trust and tag team with. In the most sincere, and honest way, And I don't mean to scare you, but you should prepare for the chance the school goes full Virtual. Unfortunately, with people being asymptomatic, it's very possible the could spread. Even if it doesn't impact the kids, and only the teachers and staff, the numbers will win when the ratio of students to teachers gets too high. I know some people who are hiring highschool students that are virtual on the same day to watch kids And go to school."
ElementaryTeachers,I love it!

ElementaryTeachers,"Have them think of a memory, but then they have to add a silly twist."
ElementaryTeachers,NearPod will be your best friend
ElementaryTeachers,I'm doing a pioneer valley books webinar tomorrow. I hope to learn a lot there.
ElementaryTeachers,"I have thought about the kids being able to recognize their teachers too. That's why I, as a teacher, have invested in a lot of very bright eye shadow. I'm hoping if I pick a color a day and go very big, and wild and maybe ever across the bridge of my nose, they can remember what color my face is if they get lost or confused."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you become a social worker, you may be working with more middle and high school age kids. Think about the age range you want to work with"
ElementaryTeachers,"NearPod also ties in with your Google slides. You can make assignments Sychronous or Asychrounus and make quizzes, games, and other stuff in your presentation"
ElementaryTeachers,Nearpod has some great stuff. You can make a free account. Also they have free webinars that train you how to use it
ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs hard to not start spiraling with all the different anxiety inducing changes - especially when paired with having a child enter school the first time. 

I grew up with a code word. I feel like that was something that really was reinforced by parents in the 90s and 2000s. 

We stopped having parents walk students to class last year because this became an issue raised by a new principal who previously worked in Chicago. Parents were upset about it to say the least, but kids didn‚Äôt mind."
ElementaryTeachers,"I love school.  I wish I could afford to get my doctorate.  I have had only good things to say about the privilege of going to school.  My emotions took control with the not walking him in.  It broke my heart this morning to watch him walk in without me.  I cried last night and this morning.  I hope it didn't  upset him.  

Paranoia is real.  Are you old enough to remember being encouraged to develop code words in case someone tried to pick you up from school? You're right about the safety measures.  With all child trafficking and pedophilia awareness increasing my mind goes to the darkest of places. 

Updates to follow."
ElementaryTeachers,"What may or may not have been conveyed in this post is that I suffer from moderately severe anxiety.  Yesterday was bad.  Both of my babies' teachers are friends of mine. I trust them fully.  

My issue with not being able to walk him was not the impetus for my fear that his experience will be effected.   Those were two thoughts strung together in a whirlwind of panicked thoughts.  Wanting to walk him was a memory I wanted to file for nostalgic moments to come. 

I agree that they need to be there. I agree that any experience in person is better than nothing."
ElementaryTeachers,Cool. If you feel in person is best go sign up to sub. Go do the in person yourself. I personally feel that the kids and teachers not dying or facing life long health issues is best.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you! I‚Äôll definitely look into these. We‚Äôre using Seesaw instead of GoogleClassroom so it makes it a little tricky, but I‚Äôm eager to make it work."
ElementaryTeachers,"Design some escape rooms, or look on TPT for some that fit your unit. Have you heard of Boom cards? It‚Äôs very easy to create your own, or you can buy some in their store. They are easy to assign via Google Classroom. The videos and related activities on BrainPOP and BrainPOP Jr. are great for viewing together or assigning asynchronously."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I‚Äôm a teacher and am also head of English at a private school in England. We went back for three weeks before the summer break, and experienced socially-distanced school life in full throes of COVID fear. 

What is SO important to understand is that children are exceptionally malleable and care free. They don‚Äôt have the fears we do, they don‚Äôt go about their days whilst holding on to their anxieties about a global pandemic like us adults do. Of course, some children experience mental health conditions which would alter this, but for neuronormative children, their only anxieties will come from their parents.

No, their experience will not be the same as other children‚Äôs in previous years, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will be any less special, or fun, or worthwhile. As cold as it may seem, not walking your child to their classroom on the first day will not change their experience of school, especially if you do not show any displeasure towards it.

As a teacher, the hardest thing about teaching in this pandemic is knowing how to approach anxious and tentative parents. Please trust that your children‚Äôs schools will care for, love and act in the best interest of your child. Any experience in a school setting is better than none right now, and if your children are allowed to just breathe and enjoy their first day, you will see that it won‚Äôt be as bad as you think!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm sorry you're in this position; it absolutely sucks. Your son's test came back negative - what a relief! However, he probably does have a different bug (like a cold) and I would wait a few more days before bringing him to school because you don't want other parents to have that same level of panic when their child has a fever. 

Your kids probably won't recognize their teachers. I went in with my mask to clean out my classroom in March and the essential workers' children didn't recognize me and I've been one of their teachers for three years. That's okay. They'll learn to recognize their teacher with a mask on as time continues. It will be weird and silly when they see their teacher without a mask on for the first time.

Your child will not be kidnapped at school. You, and other adults, aren't allowed in the building to even walk your kids to their classroom. 

Reassurance and comfort will be tricky, but teachers, school social workers and psychologists have been trying to figure this out for a while now and they'll be able to manage it. 

They won't comply with the mandate. I think that's unreasonable to expect from a kindergartener as you well know. But, teachers and parents will reinforce proper mask etiquette and it'll get better in time. 

Teachers work incredibly hard so that voices are heard. Turn and talk routines and other conversation pieces will probably be cut out to limit transmission, wetting of masks, and frustration in having to wear them. If your child needs something, a teacher will listen to their needs. They will understand them.

Speech therapists are so good at what they do. It will be hard to see how to form your mouth to make the proper sound, but they'll make it work. In my state, we have been told teachers can wear face shields (which do not really do much to limit spreading the virus) to allow students to see faces. It seems like this would be a scenario where maybe that's capitalized on. 

Your son will only feel negative about this experience if you make it feel like it's a negative - if you compare it to what it should be like. I'd try to just be as supportive as possible and maintain positivity in ""You get to go to school! I am so proud of you! I can't wait to hear all about what you learned today!"" 

You got this! Teachers are prepared to figure this all out and to support your children. I hope they have a great first day tomorrow and I hope you can update us about how it went!"
ElementaryTeachers,"They're both jobs with high burnout rates and you'll be working against systems where kids are being treated poorly and you're more or less powerless to change things. 

Teaching you'll get more quality time doing content and building relationships, and there's more lightness and joy to break up the awful. You'll still regularly deal with heartbreaking situations but there's relief. If you're a high stress person who will carry others' pain and can't shake horror and misery, you'll do better with teaching."
ElementaryTeachers,"I used Google Classroom. I assigned many things through it using Slides as I am able to embed videos and make interactive worksheets. When we did it though we assigned essentially day's worth of work over 5 day. I posted a suggested schedule to families through our class blog and shared the same schedule within Classroom. I offered regular video chats at the same times each week so families can easily schedule around them. (Mon - optional: check in and class chat, Tues - number talks, Wed-MysteryDoug, Thurs- Lit Circle book talks, Fri- Fun Friday). This might not work if you are expected to be teaching like you were if you were at school. Depending your grade level search FB for groups based on your area and grade level. For example, I am in a Kindergarten FB group for my province as I am switching grades next year (sadly) and we share resources and ideas based on our curriculum."
ElementaryTeachers,"The only one of the 3 you listed I am familiar with is RAZ-kids. It is more for primary and the interface is really for that audience. If kids have a compatible device they have access to the leveled books where you can set the level and they can read within the range. It has quizzes and you can assign benchmark books where they record them selves reading (if they have a microphone) and you can doing a running record. I do not find the books to be high quality (I prefer F&amp;P, Oxford or PM books for leveled reading material.) For intermediates (grade 4/5) we ran a lit circle online and assigned books through Epic (free) and Tumblebooks (school subscription) and focused on writing summaries and analyzing quotes and hosted weekly book talks in their group. Another supplement we used was ReadTheory which provides passages based on how the answer comprehension questions. But I would use it as such a supplement and not the main program. IXL is another program that would be good for remote, not guided reading but covers a lot language arts and math wise."
ElementaryTeachers,Ive used Raz-plus and I really enjoyed all the different book and activity options. The books were pretty interesting and had decent questions (although i did supplement a bit for higher level thinking questions). I used this for 3rd grade guided reading groups.
ElementaryTeachers,I wish I knew...commenting to see responses.
ElementaryTeachers,THANK YOUUUUU. So so so helpful. I‚Äôm screenshotting this and printing it out. üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
ElementaryTeachers,"Came to say this, dojo will fit your ticket needs perfectly. 

For prizes, maybe you can unlock games on a learning program, give extra unstructured zoom time to just chill with friends, or passes on homework assignments? I‚Äôve also been thinking about how to digitally give stickers, maybe have a picture of the kid and put ‚Äústickers‚Äù around it that they can collect."
ElementaryTeachers,No I should jump on that . Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,Have you checked out Class Dojo?
ElementaryTeachers,This is all great-thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"Not sure if this is what you need, but this was my idea: During school I reward students for extra reading in class. I give them little reading log bookmarks that act as punch cards. If they can tell me the title and topic of the book and provide their opinion of it, they get a stamp. If they fill their bookmark with 5 stamps, they get to pick a prize from the treasure chest. 

For distance learning, we‚Äôre using Canvas. I‚Äôm copying this system by creating an assignment. Students will upload a video of themself saying the title, topic, and their opinion of the book. Students are able to resubmit for each book they read and when they submit 5, I‚Äôll give them a digital reward, like choosing a gonoodle or game during our designated social zoom. I think you could do something similar on Google?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I usually like to have 2 projects planned at a time for each class. For example, if I am teaching a 1st grade drawing lesson, I will start planning the next lesson (painting, collage, etc) as soon as I begin teaching. It's too much work to plan things further in advance unless you start while you have time over the summer. As a first year teacher, you will have A LOT of work this year. It will feel overwhelming, but that is normal. It gets easier each year as you add more lesson plans and resources to your tool kit. With this year starting out a bit different, I suggest making lessons that can be easily adapted to go back into the classroom setting. 

Last Spring, we were posting asynchronous lessons each week and teaching 1 class/day synchronously. Specialists were require to help classroom teachers co-teach, and that allowed us to work together to help figure out the applications and monitor the chat. My county was using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra for synchronous teaching lessons, and we were asked to use Blackboard at my school. We finally got approval for Google Classroom (which I was using with my students before distance learning), so I'm very happy to go back to that switch. If you purchase the Future Self drawing lesson, you'll see step by step instructions and suggestions for how you can use Padlet ($10/month --- my school pays for accounts but you get 3 free Padlets at a time if you want to try it first), Google Classroom, and the presentation with the students. I've found these virtual rooms to be the best way to organize everything and help the students. 

My main suggestions for planning... 

* Think about your population of students, the curriculum, and their interests and plan from there. If I have a bunch of 2nd graders that love animals and are learning about habitats in their homeroom, how can I create a fun art project that incorporates my art standards and is engaging for the students? I could show students lots of pictures of different types of habitats and animals as inspiration and have them ""discover"" a new animal. What type of features would the creature have to survive in the environment? I would have them create the creature, give it a name, and then draw/collage/paint/sculpt the habitat, thinking about the animals needs. At the end, it's smart to give the students opportunities to reflect on what they would have done differently or have a mini critique and talk about ""glows"" for their classmates.
* Spend the time to see how your lessons will work. If you don't feel comfortable teaching something live, record a video or create a step-by-step presentation with pictures you take along the way. I've noticed that having the step-by-step pictures either way is a huge help for students whose internet is not the greatest. If you put these pictures into a presentation or ""printable"" worksheet, you can use them as a teaching tool when you return to the classroom.
* Look on Pinterest, Teachers Pay Teachers, and Instagram for ideas. You don't have to purchase anything, but this will at least give you some starting points for some lessons if you are stuck.
* Remember that you are AWESOME and whatever you do will be exciting for the students! Focus on building student relationships at the beginning of the year. It's okay to have virtual ""lunch bunches"" with students that need some extra support, but remember to only commit to time you are comfortable with. 
* Keep a routine when you teach your lessons that will translate over to the classroom. For example, you could have a quick review of class expectations (1 min), review of the learning target or lesson for the day, demonstration or inspiration, studio, clean up, reflect (easy as thumbs up, sideways, or thumbs down or rating how successful the students feel on a scale from 1 - 5 ----  This lets you know who you need to check in with the following week).

That's all I can think of right now, but if you have more specific questions, don't hesitate to ask."
ElementaryTeachers,"THANK YOU! 
I‚Äôm also in Virginia (Hampton Roads area).
I really appreciate you sharing your resources. I‚Äôm feeling so overwhelmed by all of this and feel like if can just find a starting point, things will start to fall into place. 
Is your district requiring live zoom classes or allowing you to provide content asynchronously? I don‚Äôt really know what we will be doing yet here. That‚Äôs part of my anxiety, just not knowing WHAT to plan for! 
Best of luck to you with your year. It seems like you‚Äôve really got it together!"
ElementaryTeachers,Everyone who goes will be in-class. But when they are home due to illness I‚Äôm expected to Zoom for lessons and provide follow-up work to take home.
ElementaryTeachers,"My county just switched from hybrid to 100% virtual instruction.

ElementaryTeachers,ALOT!
ElementaryTeachers,Same to you! Stay safe!
ElementaryTeachers,Totally hear you! I quit Facebook because of all the madness. We need to be mindful of our mental health more than ever . I‚Äôm so glad to have these platforms to talk to peers in the same boat! Wishing you the best as things get rolling and fingers crossed for a quick jump back to online learning until things start to look less bleak !
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs exactly what I put on FB yesterday! I had friends who aren‚Äôt teachers telling me that their kids need normal. Which is code for I want my kids out of the house and my free babysitting back. I took a break from FB because I can‚Äôt be politically correct anymore. I almost went off and then had to think about my job. I am so worried. I even told my husband last night maybe we should sell our house and move to a state that is worried about their educators and families.
ElementaryTeachers,"Exactly ! We have new hand sanitizing disposers in the hall. That‚Äôs it! In a corona hot spot ! We could have spent our time learning how to be better online teachers . Could have learned all about cool websites, software, and programs to elevate online learning ."
ElementaryTeachers,Only two weeks. It‚Äôs nothing. Teachers are going back when the kids were supposed to go back and training on safety protocols. Which is a joke because there are none.
ElementaryTeachers,How far back ? We pushed it back a week as if it‚Äôs going to all be resolved by then (lol).
ElementaryTeachers,In FL too and very scared and worried. Our county is pushing back the start date. That‚Äôs the best they can do because the governor is a gigantic douche canoe.
ElementaryTeachers,"I didn‚Äôt go to school for education, and instead got a BFA in painting and an MFA in visual art. Depending upon the needs of your area, you may be able to be hired on a provisional license and pursue your professional studies courses while teaching, which will allow your provisional license to be converted to a full license. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve worked in museums and been a substitute teacher, and entered a certificate program at a local university to do the Ed classes I needed. In February I got hired to teach elementary art full time. I‚Äôm finishing up the last classes I need in the next couple of semesters, at which point my 3 year provisional will convert to a 10 year full license. In my area, it‚Äôs hard to find good art teachers apparently, and my educational background and experience as a substitute helped me qualify for the positions I applied for. Just make sure you have a really firm grasp on classroom management, because that‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôve felt makes a huge difference between being effective or frustrated as a new teacher, regardless of if you went to school for education or not. And when you interview with principals, they absolutely will want you to demonstrate that you can manage the kids- *especially* if you don‚Äôt have a degree in education."
ElementaryTeachers,Wow unreal! It really is mind boggling . Will you be doing live online lessons as well for kids that opt to stay home ? Or is everyone going back at your school?
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear it. I‚Äôm in THE SAME BOAT but further north. You all have it much worse down there. They really need to shut the state down again. As if that will happen...at my private school, no one else seems concerned and I feel like a freak for it. No mask requirement for children, school won‚Äôt close if county does, sharing teachers if necessary due to no sub list this year. It‚Äôs gonna be a shit show! 

Best of luck, because I tried every sane, evidence-based argument to get a mask requirement but they are afraid families who don‚Äôt believe in Coronavirus (you read that right) will leave. Down goes the income. I understand it‚Äôs the livelihood of the owners but I also think maybe those aren‚Äôt the families we need to worry about keeping around.... Crazy times indeed."
ElementaryTeachers,"At my school we are teaching in class while also being recorded and live on Zoom for those who opt to stay home .

For those who are learning from home , we are expected to create packets for them that match what worksheets, activities, and projects the students and class will be completing that week. I don‚Äôt even know how this is going to be accomplished without staying later than we already do or coming in on the weekends to try and prep those materials and box them up to be picked up."
ElementaryTeachers,"Our district released some documentation saying masks would be required at all times with medical exceptions and exceptions when social distancing was happening.

Clear mask shields and other exceptions can be made with HR notification/approval."
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs amazing! I might give them a fair shot and see! I really want to be in school!
ElementaryTeachers,"I just graduated from WGU and I‚Äôm starting my first teaching job August 1.  I had a job in weeks after being certified in a state with plenty of elementary teachers.  My student teaching advisor who rated my classroom performance was an award winning principal from a school an hour away and said ‚ÄúI was a breath of fresh air.‚Äù Compared to other student teachers.  WGU is fully accredited and it was the best decision of my life to go there.  You do have to be self motivated and disciplined.  Although competency based learning is not for everyone, I absolutely loved it!"
ElementaryTeachers,"They‚Äôre still accredited. I checked before I started, and I literally just started the Masters in Elementary Ed this month. You good"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! I‚Äôll look into the Cumberlands university!
ElementaryTeachers,"University of Michigan, MSU, and Western Michigan are all really great schools for education majors. But if you‚Äôre looking for online programs, University of the Cumberlands is good and accredited. You could also consider getting a bachelors in communications, or something that would take less time, then getting a masters in teaching which would give you your initial teaching certification."
ElementaryTeachers,If you want a game my students love blooket but they get a little too crazy when it comes to the game.
ElementaryTeachers,All of engage ny is free.
ElementaryTeachers,Lots of stuff on TPT is free.
ElementaryTeachers,Some BrainPop is free but it's actually a paid site. Videos are well done but a subscription is kind of expensive.
ElementaryTeachers,"A couple resources to try out: 

[Polypad](https://mathigon.org/polypad/)

[Math Antics](https://mathantics.com/)"
ElementaryTeachers,Done üòä
ElementaryTeachers,I think some videos on learn zillion and brain pop are free.
ElementaryTeachers,Kahn academy is always a good resource. Their videos break down concepts well.
ElementaryTeachers,"I recently just had my license reciprocated for moving to another state.  I stated the process 6 +months ago and the Dept. Of Ed. I went through just issued my license a couple weeks ago.  I started applying for positions before it was accepted/issued, however no one responded to my applications until my issued license was uploaded.  Start your paperwork ASAP!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I've moved states a couple times.  Go to the state's Department of Ed website and look into their process for out-of-state teacher's licenses.  Usually it involves $$$ and maybe a certification test in your subject area.  

I would recommend getting the license process started as soon as possible, state governments move slow and they will definitely need your school transcripts, test scores, background checks, etc.    All of this takes longer than you think!  If you apply to a job before you get your license and they ask, just say it is in progress, or list that on your resume."
ElementaryTeachers,"It honestly depends on what state to what state. Some have reciprocity and some don‚Äôt. My friend just moved across the country, she got her license before applying to jobs. She had to take a couple tests. That was from New York to Washington state."
ElementaryTeachers,"Seconding that writing prompt idea! That‚Äôs a great way to get to know each of them.

I also spend the first week teaching procedures a little bit at a time, but for the first day they need to know basic stuff like:

- Your restroom policy (Do they need a pass? How many can go at a time? Etc.)
- Any must-do jobs each day when they enter your room (attendance/lunch count/morning work, etc.)
- Where extra supplies are (pencils/markers/etc.)

I try not to overload them on the first day and just keep it fun so they enjoy being in school. Best of luck!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Writing prompt: What I wish my teacher knew about me

You get a lot of surprisingly candid and helpful info from the kids.  It‚Äôs a great way to get to know how they are feeling, what they worry about and what they value."
ElementaryTeachers,True that üòÖüòÇ
ElementaryTeachers,"My favorite is Magic Playdoh (I teach 2nd). It‚Äôs a ball of white Playdoh with a smaller ball of colored Playdoh hidden in the middle. Each child is given a baggie with the Playdoh inside and a note that says this attached: ‚ÄúMagic Playdoh, oh so white / I wish I may, I wish I might / if a color should appear / it‚Äôs going to be a great school year!‚Äù The kids roll and press and squish the Playdoh around and soon a color appears‚ÄîI tell them to keep squishing until the white is mostly gone and the Playdoh is a new color. Then I have them make a sculpture of their favorite thing to play. There is so much excitement and it‚Äôs ‚Äúmagical‚Äù. It really helps to calm nerves and start the year off in a fun way. You can find it on TPT or Pinterest with recipes for salt dough and infusing the white dough with food coloring, but that just makes everyone‚Äôs hands colorful. Frankly, I found it really easy and less time-consuming to buy Sargent Art ‚ÄúArt Time Dough‚Äù in white on Amazon. I buy 3 tubs and have more than enough for 30 kids with a ball about as big as their fists. Then I buy the small colored Playdoh containers (about 3 oz.) in the Target Dollar Spot or on Amazon. They work great and avoiding food coloring is a win! 
Another great activity for the first day (to help kids get to know each other or to start small groups) is the great STEM activity called ‚ÄúSave Sam‚Äù. Google it or find it on TPT‚Äîit‚Äôs so fun! 
There are so many first day activities on TPT‚Äîlook there for sure."
ElementaryTeachers,Start doing community circles! Start off with norms for each meeting and easy to chat about topics.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks dude, I didn't know that..üòå"
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach 4th grade. I like to create the class rules with student input on the first day. We also do a lot of getting to know each other games. I usually start the morning off with some type of name game to help me and the kids with names. 

The kids have really liked the one where they think of an animal that starts with their name, and then we go around the circle (I usually start). They say theirs and then the ones before them too. (For example, I am Kate the kitten, that‚Äôs Bob the bulldog, Sam the snake, etc.) Then at the end the kids think it‚Äôs pretty funny when I have to go back through and name all of them."
ElementaryTeachers,"You might want to ask this closer to schools reopening. Right now, we don't even want to think about the first day. Give it a few years, and you'll know what I mean. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Sorry, but Reddit is really not a hiring platform. You should be working with local schools either as a supply teacher to get experience or applying to positions, or applying to international recruiters if your certification is recognized internationally."
ElementaryTeachers,"Fractions have always been a challenge for me to teach. Not fractions themselves, but converting mixed to improper and vice versa. The kids really struggle with this standard."
ElementaryTeachers,"Agree! I‚Äôve taught 1st grade thru 5th. Teaching Reading is HARD! It‚Äôs like trying to teach someone to walk by breaking it down into all the little movements each muscle, tendon, bone make. Phonics are definitely the key but so often not prioritized in the curriculum. (At least that‚Äôs been my experience)."
ElementaryTeachers,First grade reading. So much phonics. And you have to do it well or the kids get to the upper grades and still can‚Äôt decode well. A lot of people look down on the lower grades and think it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù But it‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs not easy if it‚Äôs actually done well.
ElementaryTeachers,YES! 100% I have seen this so much and the kids just get further and further behind.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I do hear this from a lot of teachers. I have also struggled with this."
ElementaryTeachers,Writing with evidence. I think it‚Äôs because the students don‚Äôt get enough practice.
ElementaryTeachers,Teaching everything in 5th grade math is challenging because half of the students get there not knowing their facts or how the base-10 system works.
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve been wanting to do this too!
ElementaryTeachers,"I completely agree. I‚Äôm also a second grade teacher and I‚Äôm about to go on my third year. I thought I was going to start with zero student and teacher materials. But then I looked at my classroom and noticed the teacher before me left everything. I definitely suggest putting priority on teacher materials such as good scissors, label maker, laminating machine, storage bins, good pens and even chart paper."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey! Definitely keep a good book list going, but your school should provide almost everything else. I‚Äôd wait and see what you absolutely need to spend your money on (or ask other people to spend their money on) once you know exactly what you need."
ElementaryTeachers,"Reason 1, money."
ElementaryTeachers,Done! Best of luck in your research! :)
ElementaryTeachers,I used the practice exams on the CTC website and I also used the yellow Cliff Notes book for the CSET exams.
ElementaryTeachers,"My question is that there is not a known CRT curriculum being pushed on schools. I'm a progressive, anti-racist educator and if there were one I'd probably know about it.

I've mainly taught upper elementary so I've also navigated parent concerns around sexual health education, which I think is a similar story here. My experience is that the curriculum is almost always years behind the current political debates.. I'd actually love to be involved in writing the curriculum political conservatives seem to think we're teaching, but in reality we're all just trying to build meaningful relationships with our students while getting them to pass the state test. I'm sure some of my students got the anti-racist and feminist subtext in my lessons, but they're the minority as always."
ElementaryTeachers,"On CRT, many (relative term, I know),school systems who have added this or are planning to will have it for parents to review. I‚Äôm hearing varying accounts of it, and with the media (all of them), reporting with their own bias, it‚Äôs hard to know what it is - really. Like any new curriculum adoption, I‚Äôve always encouraged parents to take a look so they know what their kids are learning."
ElementaryTeachers,"Social/ emotional concerns are first, followed by students behind academically. Will we be expected to bring kids traumatized by a worldwide pandemic up several grade levels in a single year?

The inclusion of ""CRT curriculum"" is very odd. I'm a progressive-minded teacher in an urban (read: very liberal) area of the country and I have no idea what this CRT boogeyman actually is. I teach upper elementary and my students are empowered when we have thoughtful, intentionally-planned lessons and classroom meetings about race, gender and other identities. I'm a white mother of a first grader who loves talking about how his friends are ""the same and also different"" and our age-appropriate conversations are enlightening for both of us. I'm unclear what's so scary about all this? I hear media speculation about ""teaching white kids they are racist and bad"" but I have no idea what real world curriculum this is referring to. It feels like a made up moral panic akin to ""rock music played backwards is devil worship."" What am I missing here?"
ElementaryTeachers,Social emotional- the kids that didn‚Äôt come back to school at all
ElementaryTeachers,"I think the issue of behavior may be underestimated this upcoming year. With students doing school from home the last year 1/2, the expectations have been different. Many of the lower elementary students have not even stepped foot in a classroom so the basic behavior expectations will need to be taught to them for the first time as 1st &amp;2nd graders."
ElementaryTeachers,All of the above AND behavior!
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,Other- bwhavior behavior behavior!
ElementaryTeachers,Also family involvement
ElementaryTeachers,Social and emotional well being- it‚Äôs a crazy world out there and many people are struggling.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks! I checked it out and it seems like the numbers aren‚Äôt editable. It‚Äôs a great resource, but I was hoping to use it for some basic addition and subtraction practice."
ElementaryTeachers,https://pbnify.com/
ElementaryTeachers,"There is a website where you can upload pictures, you click on the colors, and it will create a color by number. I found it years ago by googling it. I‚Äôll see if I can find it again."
ElementaryTeachers,I love this!! I‚Äôm gonna use this next time I‚Äôm there!
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve heard the best teachers are also the best thieves. This idea right here? Mine now!
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi guys! Sorry I haven‚Äôt been responding to y‚Äôall‚Äôs awesome comments, I have been really busy with the end of school and my AP tests. I have absolutely loved y‚Äôall‚Äôs suggestions and my next session with him Tuesday I‚Äôm gonna put some of these to work. Much love to you guys, thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,This is phenomenal!
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much for this! This is so cool!
ElementaryTeachers,"Same im uk, and was a bit confused so didn't continue."
ElementaryTeachers,I am a tutor myself and I have learned from personal experiences that it always helps to make activities fun plus interactive for them. You should try turning reading/writing activities into a game of some sort. Check out Amazon. They have loads of flash cards and other materials you can use to create a fun and interactive activity
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, by making the 5-8 year olds stop running with food in their mouths and to slow down, chew, and swallow when you see it happening, and when one does invariably choke you help them dislodge it safely. Part of supervising is making sure the hundred or so small humans are safe. I've had kids choke at recess before and had to respond."
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,"This made perfect sense and I hope you were able to get some rest! I appreciate the library system tips, it‚Äôs super helpful! I‚Äôd love to see pics of your classroom library ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yard sales, the libraries have used book sales, and the hospital auxiliary in my town used to have a huge book sale every year. I got a lot of complete or almost complete sets off of ebay years ago. 2nd graders still like Junie B. Jones, and some still like Magic Tree House. Send home Scholastic flyers next year to start earning those bonus points, though I find their books aren't made as well. They fall apart easily.

Also, think about your book loaning system and how you'll handle that. I found and started a digital library with an app to check out real books. However, it's awkward and not as fast as my little index card box with a little ""file"" for each kid. Every book has one of the old fashioned library book pockets with an index card with the book's title on it. No need for kids to sign the cards. They just hand them to you and you put the card in their little file (by student number so you only have to do it once). Then when they return, you retrieve the cards from their pocket, match it up to the books, and reshelve the books. You can train 2nd graders to put the cards back in their own books and it was a classroom job for 2 ""librarians"" to reshelve the books during book shopping time or the end of the day (all my books had labels clearly marking where they go.) Of course, Covid modified the way I did this this year, but it's still a good system.

Whew...sorry that was so much. My classroom library is kind of a point of pride with me. I can attach pictures too, if you want. I'm sleep deprived and not sure if this made sense. Enjoy 2nd grade! It is an awesome age!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I go by 2 different Goodwills on the weekends. I usually leave with 10-20 books per store. I also will go to Half Price Books, I left with like 12 books this last time. I asked my neighborhood FB group if anyone had old children's books they'd like to get rid of. I got 2 moving boxes full, for free. :) oh! And eBay, search ""children's book lot"". I ordered 40 books that way. (I will be a first year teacher (4th) this Fall, so I'm in the same boat as you)"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve taught 2nd for 18 years. I teach writing through the ‚Äú4 square‚Äù method. Look it up- it basically maps out their ideas.
ElementaryTeachers,"I would suggest getting a blank journal and then give him a prompt to write about. It could be anything! A couple examples;

If you were stuck on an island and could only bring 3 things, what would you bring and why? 

If you could choose any one super power, what would it be and why?

The more you incorporate his interests the more engaged he will be. The idea above about getting a book with no words and having him be the author is also a great strategy."
ElementaryTeachers,When my daughter was in first grade the teacher thought she couldn't read because her writing was so poor. I arranged with her older cousin to be a pen pal with her. They wrote short notes back and forth for a year and her printing improved greatly so her cousin could read what she wrote.
ElementaryTeachers,"Start with the end in mind, then plan backwards. Let‚Äôs say you want him to write a paragraph- what does he need to know to do that? Topic sentence, detail sentences, conclusion, indenting, etc. Then plan lessons to help him master each of these skills- then put them all together!"
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs smart! He likes to read to so that could be an idea. Thank you! Also I will def have more questions so I will DM you sometime
ElementaryTeachers,"Also, I teach second grade. So if you need some extra help you can DM me."
ElementaryTeachers,"What is he specifically struggling with? Ideas, grammar? 

I remember I used a book without words once. Student had to write what was going on in the book. I think it was called the Adventures of Polo?"
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe ask [r/tutor](http://reddit.com/r/tutor).
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre doing that! What is he interested in? If there‚Äôs a way to tie in his interests that will definitely help him be more engaged.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm a 1st year teacher and I asked friends/family for donations. There were a lot of people looking to get rid of books that their kids had aged out of. Not all of the books are great, but I was able to pick and choose what I wanted to include in my library!"
ElementaryTeachers,The ones I‚Äôm a part of are ‚Äúteachers buy sell trade-Orlando‚Äù and ‚Äúteachers bargain basement‚Äù. You can also find people selling books on the Facebook marketplace too. I would just search up teacher groups in your area.
ElementaryTeachers,Do you know some names of the Facebook teacher groups?
ElementaryTeachers,"Welcome to 2nd grade! It's such an awesome grade to teach. I've spent the last 10 years slowly accumulating my library. Scholastic often has deals, like 50 books for $50. Half price books, garage sales, teachers retiring, our book fair just did  a BOGO promotion. I've invested thousands of dollars into mine over the years."
ElementaryTeachers,"Not really. Recess isn't a break for teachers, btw, since we have to line the kids up, take them out, supervise snack so no one chokes, do supervision duty, bring them back from outside, and prep. Recess is just more work for us."
ElementaryTeachers,"Depending on where you live, Scholastic will have warehouse sales that you can volunteer for. They give you $10 credit an hour to spend at the sale.
I got so many of my books doing this over the summer."
ElementaryTeachers,I asked my parents to send in age-appropriate books their child no longer wants.
ElementaryTeachers,"Depends on what you need for it. I collected donated locked down tablets &amp; e-readers and downloaded a bunch of kid-favorite books. Most local libraries also give access to their digital collections or third party digital collections. 

Epic books is also an awesome, free library for elementary kiddos where you can create profiles for each student. It tracks everything they read and how quickly."
ElementaryTeachers,"I second goodwill. I got a lot of good books without spending a lot of money. I also joined some Facebook teacher groups in my area that were buy, sell, trade. 

Some of the popular titles that my students like (2nd grade) are the Dogman books, Bad Guy series, and Magic Tree House."
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely Newbury Medal, Corretta Scott King Award, Pura Belpre, and Caldecott awarded books are definitely a good start. I try to annually buy my own copies of these award winners, depending on the needs of my students in a given year (make sure to label or stamp it as yours! It‚Äôd suck to get your personal books mixed with the school‚Äôs books).

With second grade, I also like having collections of Mo Willems for students who are still developing phonetic awareness. For students reading beyond second grade I had Magic Tree House, Roald Dahl, or other higher-level chapter books. 

As for paying for all this ‚Äî it was collected over time. Thrift stores, previous teachers, or giveaways at events. I bought my own books that were harder to get and newer prints. Overall, I‚Äôve got a nice little personal collection and my school provides a decent amount per class."
ElementaryTeachers,"Looking at award winners children's books such as Newberry, Caldecott, and Geisel is a good start."
ElementaryTeachers,"I would laugh, and then put it away. It is funny, but I‚Äôd rather a positive mug; or something I‚Äôd use like starbucks or a set of fine point sharpies. ü§©"
ElementaryTeachers,I built mine through Goodwill runs and joining Scholastic book clubs.
ElementaryTeachers,"No. I got 8 mugs for Christmas, 3 for Teachers Appreciation Week, 2 for my birthday, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get more on the last day of school. Save me a trip to Goodwill amd get me a Starbucks gift card!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for the information. I will make sure to pay attention to the weekly instructional reports.
ElementaryTeachers,"I am an intervention specialist whose district uses it and I love it personally. Teachers must pay attention to the weekly instructional reports to track student progress, especially in the domains that they score low in on the diagnostics. I incentivized my students when I was a classroom teacher each Monday morning by awarding/recognizing them on usage and pass rate goals. Instructional groupings provided by iReady helped me form intervention small groups and also provided some good lessons."
ElementaryTeachers,Following!
ElementaryTeachers,Go to the dollar store and get a whole bunch of assorted toys and put them in a ‚Äúprize box‚Äù
ElementaryTeachers,I teach second and my kids love Brag Tags! You can find them on TPT.
ElementaryTeachers,I like to get party favors from target.
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,"Fancy bookmarks, fun erasers in the shape of...anything (I bought food shaped erasers from the dollar section of target, like hot dogs and hamburgers that come apart, and they love those), cute mechanical pencils, tiny slinky‚Äôs/tiny rubix cube. Also, they probably still like stamps and stuffed animals"
ElementaryTeachers,"I would let my students ‚Äúrent‚Äù fidget toys, it was their responsibility to return them unharmed to get to choose another one. One girl broke hers and it was really cute how much effort she put in to getting one just like it to make up for it. I would have told her just to be more careful next time, but she insisted that she had to replace it."
ElementaryTeachers,"Books, bookmarks, clicker pens, fidgets, positive call home"
ElementaryTeachers,"Snappy hands, slap bracelets, free hw pass"
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe this is my chance to bring them back and change the world
ElementaryTeachers,"Mechanical pencils, shaped erasers, dum dum pops. Skittles are great for instant gratification (following directions, participation, etc.) Also small fidget toys such as stress balls or Koosh balls."
ElementaryTeachers,Haha not at all! I think they only lasted a couple of years in the early 2010s. I liked them! Haha. I was 19/20 and had one! :P
ElementaryTeachers,"Are silly bands still a thing, I feel old."
ElementaryTeachers,"In grade 6 the teacher used to buy the big bulk container (I assume from Costco) of Sour Keys. Those were always a hit! They were fairly large. (I wasn‚Äôt a fan of sour but most kids were) 

I like any fidget type toy. Search ‚Äúmonkey noodles‚Äù those are my new fave! Haha"
ElementaryTeachers,You know those rubber animal keychains you can get where the eyes pop out? Kids go wild for those
ElementaryTeachers,"It always makes me feel a little better to find out they are no longer in the classroom, because when I see some of those Instagram accounts, I‚Äôm like- what teacher has time for all this ON TOP of teaching full time?!üòÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,"I appreciate it, thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"To my knowledge, your master's degree likely doesn't have to have any type of licensure tied to it. It will, of course, mostly likely have to be an accredited program (but you knew that).

If you were already employed, I would tell you to call your HR department and ask what kinds of master's programs they'll accept for movement on the salary schedule. They'd be able to tell you which ones would work and which wouldn't. For example, my district states we can do whatever program we want, so long as it's accredited and the degree relates somewhat to our content. I teach elementary and I got my master's in educational technology, for example. I would assume one that would NOT work would be, say, a science teacher getting a master's degree in French Literature. 

As far as your worry about the licensure or endorsement, I would not worry about this. I've honestly never heard of such a thing. Just get your credential after your bachelor's and you'll be fine as far as teaching goes. Then decide what master's you want to get. By that time, if you already have a job, then you can start asking around regarding specific degrees and programs.

I am in California, for reference."
ElementaryTeachers,"It may be obvious, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many teachers forget. Especially this year."
ElementaryTeachers,"that isn't too weird to me as this is kindergarten, esp if this is closer to the beginning of the school year? the student might have had some separation anxiety as a lot of kiddos come to kindergarten without any preschool experience"
ElementaryTeachers,i feel like this is obvious. anyone who starts teaching and doesn't want to smile at their students should pick a diff career imo
ElementaryTeachers,Depends on the state. Some only require one of them.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for your reply!
ElementaryTeachers,You have to take both. Core is first. And then the elementary praxis is usually due a little before you start student teaching.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! We are pretty new, launched a couple months ago so people are just starting to find out about Set4Math. We have had a very positive response from our users! Would love to have you try a free trial and share your feedback!"
ElementaryTeachers,Has anyone tried this?  Opinions?
ElementaryTeachers,Oh my! Great point! Thanks for this!
ElementaryTeachers,I love the numbered list! Another teacher after my own heart! Thanks for all of the help!
ElementaryTeachers,The book clubs are a great idea! Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,Ohhh yes! That makes sense!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yesss the girl drama is so real. Also the boy drama. Also the boy/girl drama. Every year so and so has a crush on so and so and nobody knows how to deal with it/everyone loses their mind about it. Last year I had a student who would loudly proclaim his undying love for another student at random. We had to have the ‚ÄúI know that you like her, but look at her face. You‚Äôre making her really uncomfortable,‚Äù conversation like twice a month."
ElementaryTeachers,"Agree with the above. I‚Äôve taught 1-5th grades. One year I went from teaching 4th to teaching 1st - reverse of what you‚Äôre wanting. 
Agree about the sense of humor - and it‚Äôs very effective in relationship building with the students. 

They like to feel like you trust them with their learning. Show them you truly believe in them and they‚Äôll far exceed their own expectations. 

Big difference between a 1st and 4th grader is they KNOW the difference. If you tell a 1st grader ‚ÄúI know you can do it‚Äù they‚Äôll believe you even if you‚Äôre just saying it. Fourth graders? Not a chance. They KNOW whether you believe it and they‚Äôll call you out on it. In a nutshell:

1. Above all else, foster trusting relationships with the students - this will help with classroom management- because they‚Äôll start to push the boundaries. (1st graders love you no matter what, 4th graders. Are a little more discerning)

2. Give them some independence - they‚Äôre ready for it. They‚Äôre also able to think more abstractly and critically which can make learning so fun!

3. Begin your year touting the importance of kindness - girl drama is real at this age

4. When it comes to what they really need and want, it‚Äôs not all that different from 1st graders - 
A safe environment, acceptance, sense of achievement, boundaries and love. 

Good luck!! üíû"
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I taught second grade for a year and now 4th grade for 6 years. 

Academically, 4th graders are ready for more independence. Not TOTAL independence, but definitely less hovering. Most importantly, they are super 100% ready for more in-depth collaborative projects that the little guys could never pull off. In my room, we have ‚Äúbook clubs,‚Äù where each kid has a job and they read a chapter of the book together, on their own, without a teacher present (or, I mean, with the teacher across the room). Nobody can do their job without everybody else, so they have to hold each other accountable. We do something similar in math, where kids work on their own on a problem that‚Äôs just a *little* too hard, then come together after a certain amount of time to see if they can figure out how to solve it. 

Socially, they‚Äôre ready for more responsibility! I definitely push the ‚Äúhow do you solve this problem?‚Äù (Like...an argument with your friend) off on them more than I did in the little grades. Sometimes, if they do something foolish, I air them down and ask them what they think their consequence should be (depends on what they did, though). 

Fourth graders are also have a way better sense of humor than the little guys (they ‚Äúget‚Äù way more jokes) so it‚Äôs easy to make everything funny and boom they‚Äôre engaged. Just make sure they know where to find the line between ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to be funny,‚Äù and ‚Äúyiiikes not now bro.‚Äù"
ElementaryTeachers,"Agreed. And to add onto this, a lot less learning to read and a lot more reading to learn. While phonics still comes up occasionally the focus really shifts to comprehension."
ElementaryTeachers,"I have taught both. In my opinion, 4th graders are at a transition age where they are trying to be more independent and fit in with peers. While firsties are total pleasers, 4th graders begin with the sass, but it‚Äôs more like experimental boundary pushing than being disrespectful.
4th graders are also ready for independent project based lessons, so I would talk about how I would create some lesson designs based on that."
ElementaryTeachers,Still doesn‚Äôt make it legal. But I understand.
ElementaryTeachers,"Some schools force you to stand for it but not say it and that‚Äôs how they get away with it. My entire school district I worked for years ago you had to stand even if you didn‚Äôt say it. I didn‚Äôt make kids stand, but I explained how some people tie it to respect for the nation, and openly discussed the controversy with it (middle schoolers). I was so happen when I got two semesters in a row it happened during my planning, and therefore no kid could tattle I didn‚Äôt stand."
ElementaryTeachers,It's normal. There may have even been communication between Mom and the teacher about why the student was so upset that particular morning before dropping her off. No biggie.
ElementaryTeachers,"So, that would not have been a big deal back in the day.  If the child was distraught and was made to feel safe, it sounds like the teacher made an appropriate move at the time."
ElementaryTeachers,As an early childhood teacher it is normal to comfort children who are having a rough time. It‚Äôs much different than teaching older kids. Also it‚Äôs not a good idea to send them home because then the child learns if I make a big deal then I get to get out of school and get what I want.
ElementaryTeachers,It was just that one time.
ElementaryTeachers,INFO: Was this an every day thing or did it happen that one time?
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe you could use if you give a mouse a cookie and say it‚Äôs an oatmeal cookie.
ElementaryTeachers,"Check out Epic! They have a ton of online books that are super visually appealing. You will have to ‚Äútry it out for free‚Äù as it is ultimately a paid service.

ElementaryTeachers,"Sorry about that! The paperback version is available for purchase online in Jordan. 

Here is a link of one bookstore where it is available: https://www.jordan.ubuy.com/en/product/1ZECEQ88-good-morning-trees-a-journey-in-learning-about-climate-change-and-how-to-make-a-difference

I hope you and your students enjoy it!"
ElementaryTeachers,"It's probably based on my country! I'm in Jordan and can't use a VPN right now, so that's likely it. Oh well! Thanks anyway."
ElementaryTeachers,"That‚Äôs odd. I just tried the link and it worked. 

Here is the longer url link for the free ebook starting tomorrow: https://www.amazon.com/Good-Morning-Trees-learning-difference-ebook/dp/B08ZMCM4NT/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=good+morning+trees+nnoli&amp;qid=1618896129&amp;sprefix=good+morning+trees&amp;sr=8-3

Let me know if these links work for you. Happy Reading!"
ElementaryTeachers,The Amazon link didn't work! It says not available for purchase.
ElementaryTeachers,I would talk to the parents about getting a newer edition of the game IF you know the parents are financially able (which they likely are if they are paying for private tutoring). I also remember doing a ‚Äúone hour of code‚Äù event and they have a free website here: https://hourofcode.com/us
ElementaryTeachers,"I still have a year left of my program but I feel you with the overwhelm! My plan is to either sub or work as a para for a year or so to get a feel for my teaching style and if I might want to get special ed training. If you know you want to teach Montessori that sounds like a great plan, and even if you don‚Äôt end up teaching Montessori you can take what you learned into any position. I personally don‚Äôt feel ready to commit to having my own classroom yet and I think I would benefit from other types of teaching experiences before moving into that role."
ElementaryTeachers,"You could always sub! Subbing is a great way to make connections in a school district, figure out your teaching style, and see which grade or type of schools are best for you. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,Still spamming this trash?  Yikes!
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs great to hear. Yes it‚Äôs a lot to take in. Some of the complaints my district‚Äôs third grade planning group had were how we had trouble applying lessons that required partner work online. We felt it didn‚Äôt lend itself very well to remote learning.
ElementaryTeachers,"I would highly recommend just switching to an elementary education major and I'd you want some expirence in childhood development try getting a minor in it! It would be helpful in the classroom but an elementary education can be mandatory for certification and getting a job (depending on district). In my state you can get an emergency teaching certificate if you are in with a district but they require you to be in a program or starting a program. If you have any questions you can dm me and I can help you look for information based on your state.

I highly recommend an ed program though because a lot of programs can help you to be more prepared."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! I have access to it right now and it‚Äôs SO much to look at.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much!!! Sorry for the delay!
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for your interest and for checking it out! I really appreciate it. If you want more info or to check in on why you might not qualify, feel free to DM me and we can troubleshoot. Otherwise, thanks for trying!"
ElementaryTeachers,Done üòä
ElementaryTeachers,I will check toMorrow when I go to school! Isn‚Äôt there a bot that can remind me...
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôd be interesting in helping via zoom! During the pandemic I‚Äôve actually been thinking about starting my own tutoring business. It‚Äôs called Tutoring with a Twist and each 45 minute lesson includes 15 minutes of a fun social emotional activity in addition to 30
Minutes of whichever content area you or your child feel they need help in (or homework, etc). I studied child development in school and am currently a third grader teacher. I‚Äôve seen what this pandemic and not being in classrooms has done to students first hand and I thought this idea could help students. I‚Äôd be willing to try it out with her! She sounds lovely to work with and like such a bright girl ü•∞"
ElementaryTeachers,Hmm for some reason I didn't qualify.
ElementaryTeachers,I would buy a few pairs of Old Navy Pixies and try looking somewhere like Marshall‚Äôs for some tops and dresses/skirts. A lot of teachers will start to wear dresses in the warmer months. I felt absolutely lost when it came to dress code when I started student teaching and felt obligated to buy an entire wardrobe. Don‚Äôt stress out too much about it! You‚Äôll build your wardrobe in no time.
ElementaryTeachers,"When I teach this stuff, particularly growth mindset and conflict management, I wish there was a class on it for adults! I went to elementary school in the 80s, and there really wasn‚Äôt any such thing as growth mindset yet- at least, not taught in a mainstream way. We could all use a little more of it in our lives!"
ElementaryTeachers,"The majority of my time is spent in class building relationships, cultivating community before curriculum every day and tending to their socio-emotional development. I‚Äôm not really worried that a few deadlines are going to trigger their trauma. But thanks for sharing your perspective."
ElementaryTeachers,"I did watch the video. Assuming you created this video, you addressed my main concern, but not quite to my satisfaction. 

You mentioned that students with good reasons for missing assignments are given exceptions, but that completely glosses over the fact that students in trauma are not likely to share about that trauma with their teachers. Most of my class population has 6 or more ACEs. They‚Äôre not going to tell me they didn‚Äôt do their work bc they‚Äôre worried they won‚Äôt get enough to eat, their parents are fighting/doing drugs and they don‚Äôt feel safe, etc. They‚Äôll say they don‚Äôt care or make up other flimsy excuses. By not working with them on the deadlines you‚Äôre feeding into their anxiety which could further trigger their trauma."
ElementaryTeachers,I sent you the questions! :)
ElementaryTeachers,"And of course you didn‚Äôt actually take the time to watch the video, because your time is too valuable, but you still have time to make assertions based on a perspective you haven‚Äôt actually listened to. Stay classy. Thanks for your comments!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I 100% disagree with this. I‚Äôm not going to go into all my reasons, because frankly I value my time more, but this is wrong on so many levels."
ElementaryTeachers,Why 1944?
ElementaryTeachers,Me not racist
ElementaryTeachers,ü•∫
ElementaryTeachers,You're a racist troll account. Fuck off.
ElementaryTeachers,So the world isnt flat :/
ElementaryTeachers,No. This is not the sub for this. Leave.
ElementaryTeachers,8th year 1st grade teacher! I‚Äôll help if tik still need :)
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey person! 5th grade and it‚Äôs my first year. Shoot me them q‚Äôs if you still need.

Edit: a word"
ElementaryTeachers,"At a deeper level, it must be odd starting off your day participating in something so plainly against your conviction. 

From the outside looking in (again I‚Äôm not American) it seems so unfair to staff to force them to bring nationalism and religion into the classroom."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so so much! I really appreciate it! I sent you a message with the questions.
ElementaryTeachers,I'll bite. I teach 4th grade and this is my 5th year teaching.
ElementaryTeachers,"Some really interesting insights here, love to see so much engagement on a post! 

It was noteworthy that a few of you commented saying that you never realised how strange the pledge actually is and that is perceived by people outside of the US as a little uncomfortable. 

Another question if you might indulge me. Do the teachers unions have a stance on the pledge? Is there any sort of organised movement dedicated to either removing/maintaining the pledge? 

Thanks üôÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,Padlet. Padlet.com is the only thing I can come up with.
ElementaryTeachers,What grade?
ElementaryTeachers,"Epic is a feee website! You sign up for a free educator account and create profiles for the students. When they login with a class code, they click on their name. They can read tons of books or listen to books on there! It tracks how much reading they do, so you can see their minutes and books on your account. It‚Äôs essentially like free reading time. You can create quizzes and assessments for books on there and assign books to students too. You can sort the books by grade and reading level. I really like it!

Edit: Websites like Bookflix or Storyline Online are good for read alouds too. It depends on your grade level and school though for it you could justify it. I know that I could easily justify it as modeling fluent reading, exposing students to books, and background knowledge of new content at my grade level."
ElementaryTeachers,Gotcha. That's great advice because I intend on working abroad again sometime in the future! I also worked in South Korea for 2 years and loved it. If I go back abroad i will definitely look into teaching at an international or American school so getting a teaching license in elementary ed sounds like it would open up more doors for me. Thanks for the awesome advice and help @teskar!
ElementaryTeachers,"This hugely depends on where you live. In Texas, just about every district requires ESL certification no matter what you teach. Consider where you live and where you want to work. It will vary state by state as to what makes you more competitive. I'll be adding a SPED certification to my license when Covid settles down, so I'll be ESL and SPED certified, but I teach 4th grade ELA and social studies."
ElementaryTeachers,"6th year teacher. 4th year in Kindergarten.  It is already hard being a first year teacher, let alone during THIS wacko year of teaching.  Take a breath, and take it day by day.  I don‚Äôt know what I would do if my grade level didn‚Äôt collaborate and plan together so we can share the work load.  Maybe consider simplifying what you do with the kids, or reach out to your grade level."
ElementaryTeachers,"I worked in South Korea for 6 years and Japan for 2. I am working as an elementary teacher in Canada where I intend on staying. While abroad, most people I met who worked at international schools did their Education training in either a Secondary School teachable (science, math, English) or Elementary. There are certainly teaching positions for teachers who specialized in ESL, but fewer that for teachers who have more teachable subjects.  Could you possibly take methods course in another teachable in addition to ESL?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks Teskar! That makes sense, elementary education seems like it would be much more desired and needed rather than a specific subject such as ESL. I know that here in the US major cities that ESL is in high demand. Also did you work abroad or have friends who worked abroad and had better luck getting hired licensed in elementary education rather than ESL?"
ElementaryTeachers,"On the other hand, I prefer seeing a small group of students and a lot of students. I was a homeroom teacher. Now I get full classes for 40 mins and they rotate. I prefer the latter, so it‚Äôs all personal preference."
ElementaryTeachers,"I also taught ESL abroad for 6 years, then got my masters in Elementary Ed and am teaching fourth grade. I enjoy having the same core group of kids every day, whereas I had to work with a lot more students than when teaching ESL abroad. Also, its nice you can kind of pick the grade you want to teach rather than having to teach a bunch if different age groups. However, the workload is pretty intense, especially this year. They just put so much of your plate that it is hard to do everything. I honestly think ESL would be better because you have small groups of students that you work with each day and have less of the other random paperwork and communicating with parents. Plus you can probably reuse some materials across multiple groups."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm Canadian, so take that into consideration.  Imho Elementary Ed will get you further long term. You will typically take your methods courses in a variety of subjects rather than a few more in depth. ESL jobs in public school often involve a circuit because you have you caseload distributed over a few schools. If you decide to work abroad again, employers often favour Elementary-trained teachers over ESL teachers because of their methods courses. ESL is more likely to pidgeon-hole you."
ElementaryTeachers,Wow. Thanks for the thorough response. You‚Äôre great.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 4th grade teacher. I had a 3rd grader and a 5th grader at home with me when we went remote. I'm a good parent and a good teacher. My kids just rejected me as their teacher. We fought pretty regularly and they didn't put in the same effort that I know they put in when they are in class. The student teacher relationship, especially at that age is still one where the student has the mindset that whatever their teacher says is the right thing to do and something that they need to follow to a T. 

4th grade is a really important year for taking skills in 3rd grade and expanding them. In third grade you multiply, in 4th you multiply 4 digits by 1 and 2 digits by 2 digits. With regards to reading practice practice practice. Read everyday and it gets easier. 

You might really hate this but the Common Core Standards are a guide for what they should be learning during the year. Most people are pretty intimidated by / unknowledgeable about them. But what they generally break down to is a skill that a child should be able to do. For example. 4.nbt.b.4 Breaks down to 4th grade, Numbers in Base 10 (this is generally going to be how do you compute with number), B (honestly know idea why they differentiate b from a here), 4 - this is the fourth item on the list. 

4.nbt.b.4 reads:  Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm. .... All this means is that students can add and subtract the regular way. This is a lot different than what most people think of when they think of Common Core.

Free Resources: 

I really like Khan Academy as a resource to maintain skills you've already learned. [https://www.khanacademy.org/](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

Epic has a ton of books that are available during school hours: [https://www.getepic.com/](https://www.getepic.com/)

PBS Learning Media has a lot of great and interesting stuff: [https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/](https://mass.pbslearningmedia.org/)

The Smithsonian - This is quickly becoming one of my favorite sites for teaching history because of their excellent collection. [https://www.si.edu/](https://www.si.edu/)

If/When I think of others that do not require a subscription I will let you know. 

Remember at all times, this is fucking pandemic and we are all trying our hardest. None of us were prepared for this and so you are not failing your kids you are showing them how to put one foot in front of the other and trying to make it through each day. 

Godspeed!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Every state has the standards you can Google! Don‚Äôt forget about Social Studies and Science. 

English: Work on reading from short stories to bigger chapter books. Kids should be able to answer simple questions about the text as well as think deeply about the theme/message.

Math: make sure they know all their times tables 1-12 quickly. Identify, visualize and add/subtract  easy fractions. Be able to do longer(up to 5 digit) adding and subtracting questions. Multiply larger number such as 2 double digit numbers.

Social Studies: Learn about your home state and Native Americans.

Science: Learn about the human body!

If you have any further questioner me know and I‚Äôd love to help."
ElementaryTeachers,Reading with comprehension
ElementaryTeachers,You can be sarcastic but you have to be real blunt. Exaggerated faces to go asking with it.  Be prepared if you do for them to still not get it and even have their feelings hurt.
ElementaryTeachers,I'm gonna miss the sarcasm from the older grades lol. Which humor works best?
ElementaryTeachers,I teach fourth grade and love it! I agree with everything Teacherman6 wrote. Good luck!
ElementaryTeachers,"I've been in 4th for a few years and I really like it. Its an interesting grade because you have half the class still in the imagination based play world and the other half of the class interested in walking and talking and socializing. This can be hard for a lot of kids who quite literally see their friends walking away from them when they are not ready to move on. 

They will still work hard for you which is one of my favorite things about elementary kids. Even the ones that are struggling still give effort. 

They haven't really had the hormones kick in yet which is nice. You may have a few who do by the end of the year but for the most part I think the bigger changes start to happen in the second half of 5th grade. 

They may present like they are understanding what you are talking about but things do need to be a bit more clear than you may first expect. 

This is a huge growing year just all around. I wouldn't use too much sarcasm as they probably wont really get it. 

Have fun, its a great grade!"
ElementaryTeachers,What are the options in Texas?
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm in college right now and plan to become an elementary teacher. There was never one eureka moment, but there were a few big moments that contributed to my decision to try to become an elementary teacher.
1)It seems like by highschool, pretty much all of the students hate math. I want to teach math to the students in a way that makes them move it and want to explore it more in highschool.
2)The way I‚Äôve seen elementary kids being taught history (of Colombus, the founding fathers, ect). This definitely needs to change.
3) Childhood is just such a pivotal point, and so much good can be done. 
Sorry if this was kind of incoherent, I just wrote stream of conciousness/whatever came to mind"
ElementaryTeachers,"For me, it was when I taught Sunday school for the first time. I fell in love with teaching kids. It's unpopular for males to go into the elementary teaching field, but I'm glad to be making a difference!"
ElementaryTeachers,Honestly that is one of the reasons i wanted to teach.
ElementaryTeachers,"For me, it was when I realized how crooked the US education system is. I want to start a revolution of newfound education and apply different educational approaches so that we can be sure that our kids (aka the future of humanity) have a well established knowledge that they can apply in the real world not only personally, but also environmentally, socially, and psychologically. I want to change the world and I believe that the best way to do that is to teach children in an empowering and honest manner rather than a systematic placement of kids based on their level of ‚Äúskill‚Äù so that they can enter the world with a clear mind and a clear intent of keeping it safe and livable and enjoyable"
ElementaryTeachers,"Unpopular opinion here, but I don't think teaching is a calling. It is a job. I choose it as my job because I hate doing it everyday less than I hate doing most other jobs every day. I try my best to be good at my job because I am a try hard. But it is not my life and I was not inspired to dedicate myself to this great calling."
ElementaryTeachers,"I feel like I had some awesome trusted adults that I learned a lot from in middle school science and high school English; I knew I wanted to be a teacher because of them and the amazing work they did - for me and my peers. Then I thought about how stupid it was that it took until 7th grade for me to feel like I had a teacher who cared about me so I decided to teach elementary. I‚Äôm teaching third and fourth grade science, and I do a lot of coverage on my prep times; my school is significantly better than the school I went to - I definitely made the right choice."
ElementaryTeachers,"When I was in the teaching field, I fell into teaching preschool bc I needed a job right out of college. Ended going for my masters in elementary education. 

Then I saw how crappy my coworkers were. 

Then I realized how much I loved actually teaching. Teaching isn't just giving information, it's making sure the content is understood and finding ways to make it understood for everyone. It's being a mom when there's a need, a nurse when needed, a mandated reporter when needed. 

I fell absolutely in love with my students and how the light bulbs would go off when they understood something. The trouble makers, the nose pickers, the assholes. Everyone has something going on and needs kindness. 

Every child is someone's miracle. If not, then they should be yours. It's hard to see past the behavior sometimes but needed."
ElementaryTeachers,"I guess I just figured because measurements are done with x. Like measuring wood, we write 2 x 4."
ElementaryTeachers,I agree with everything you said. I'd rather have kids learn with the dot instead of 'x' in regards to learning multiplication
ElementaryTeachers,"If you want to check them out, they are on Amazon (The Able Fables) or theablefables.com!"
ElementaryTeachers,Aw! Thank you! They are in Amazon (The Able Fables) or my website theablefables.com!
ElementaryTeachers,They are perfect for 1st grade! You can check them out on Amazon (The Able Fables) or theablefables.com!
ElementaryTeachers,"Pre-covid, we just asked Mom to come in and observe her child. It works really well for two big reasons: 1) the child‚Äôs behavior is improved and 2) Mom gets to see what her child‚Äôs peers are doing in comparison. 

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an option, but I‚Äôd encourage it. We had a student whose mom was in absolute denial for 2 years and then finally, we invited her to observe / spend the day with him as part of his birthday celebration and after that Mom was onboard."
ElementaryTeachers,"It sounds like he‚Äôs acting out because he‚Äôs not able to access the content. I‚Äôve had students like this in the past, but they‚Äôve all had IEPs and so we had SPED support for them. Maybe see if your SPED department would be willing to provide interventions even though they aren‚Äôt legally required. If at all possible, providing text to speech and speech to text accommodations are super helpful as well. Are you using any behavior trackers or reward systems?"
ElementaryTeachers,4th!
ElementaryTeachers,I would love these! 1st grade
ElementaryTeachers,Absolutely! These are wonderful. 2nd Grade
ElementaryTeachers,"Good to know. For now I‚Äôm starting at Kinder and working up to 5th. With main focus on ELA/Phonics/Math. 

I know I‚Äôll get tired of the grind and will be sure to toss in a science ones for 4th/5th. Thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Ooooh, I‚Äôm super interested in this. I teach 3rd and 4th grade science and all the good science songs seem like they‚Äôre targeted at middle school or early elementary."
ElementaryTeachers,"This is really helpful, thank you!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Our SPED this year is in the big multipurpose room along with students who want help, all spaced apart. I had to leave so no idea how that‚Äôs going."
ElementaryTeachers,"Also, expectations include sitting up / not laying down, wearing clothes, raising hand / staying on mute until called on, focusing on the learning. A lot of HR teachers were able to have them mirror our normal in school rules and I think that really helped."
ElementaryTeachers,"We have a 2-3 adult per Zoom policy. If a child needs to be muted / corrected more than 3 times, we pull them into a breakout room with 2 adults to discuss behavior. If unable to do so, we text our student behavior support team and social work teams to join our Zoom to support, and set the child in the waiting room until adults can join. I‚Äôm really thankful we have a robust student support team and policy. Also, if students misuse the chat, we disable it until the next class and don‚Äôt allow individual private chats between students."
ElementaryTeachers,"Darn.... Thanks for trying. If I ever find time to figure this out, I'll definitely let you know!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Same. I emailed one of the people who sells them on teachers pay teachers, but she really didn‚Äôt want to tell me how she makes them."
ElementaryTeachers,"During student teaching and my first year, I had to seriously take day by day. Good luck to you."
ElementaryTeachers,"I use a lot of great texts that spark conversations if you read deeply. A couple great examples are Last Stop On Market Street, and Rap a Tap Tap."
ElementaryTeachers,"Not a book, but Scholastic magazines for Kinder have a lot of civics in them and your kids would enjoy them."
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely depends on the state and their licensure requirements! Look into it for your specific circumstances, but you're not out of the running for most jobs, I would think! Good luck! :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I literally did this. My M.Ed program has licensure kinda built in, so I got my teaching license around the time I graduated with my masters."
ElementaryTeachers,"What state? You can get an alternative certification with any bachelors degree in some, if not most, states."
ElementaryTeachers,"Some have mentioned asking the college, which is a good start, but to absolutely make sure you should call the certification agency of your state. They are the ones who determine if you have the qualifications to teach"
ElementaryTeachers,"I myself had my bachelors in business and I just recently graduated with my Masters in Childhood Education.  I recently got a long term sub position after looking for a few months.  Like others have said, it sort of depends on your location.  

Because of the current situation in the world, there will be jobs available at some point, the timing will be a bit different, just keep a lookout and when you do student teaching, try to meet as many people as possible and network!  It will help!  Good luck."
ElementaryTeachers,I have a bachelors in ethics and went back for a Masters in Teaching last year. Some states offer a 1 year program that includes certification. Currently teaching 1st grade!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm finishing my M.S.Ed. right now and my undergrad was not education-related. Most places will let you teach with a M.Ed. or M.S.Ed. because those programs generally require student teaching and lead to certification.

Having classroom experience/experience working with school-age children will help a lot too if you‚Äôve done that before.

My guess is you will be fine doing a master‚Äôs, but you can check your state‚Äôs DOE website to be sure if you‚Äôre in the USA. Best of luck!!"
ElementaryTeachers,I think you are all set as long as you get your teaching certificate in the state you wish to teach in. I would ask the advisers at the Masters program you are looking at. They will have answers too
ElementaryTeachers,"Hello! I got my teaching certification in California and moved to New York, they did have a ‚Äúshorter‚Äù path for me since I had my clear certification and had been teaching over 3 years. Three 1 day college classes and a year of waiting for them to approve all my paperwork is all it took to get my teaching certification in New York State."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the info!
ElementaryTeachers,"Ya, you generally have to take all exams for that state that you haven‚Äôt taken. Hopefully there is some overlap! I agree the edTPA  definitely helped across states."
ElementaryTeachers,"In Minnesota we have to do the Ed TPA and pass our MTLEs. Teachers who move here are also required to take the MTLEs to get licensed on this state. I‚Äôm not totally sure about the specifics on it, but the Ed TPA helps with getting licensed in a new state if you move!"
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,Look into Minecraft Education!
ElementaryTeachers,"You need to meet with his parents right away. ‚ÄúHands are sore from typing?‚Äù Give me a break. You‚Äôre the boss, not him, but it sounds like he‚Äôs running the show. Switch to Google Meet or Zoom and you both can do everything you want to do. Your current tutoring platform isn‚Äôt working so who cares what he wants? He sounds like a stubborn, spoiled kid, used to getting his way and full of excuses. Because of the pandemic there are myriads of digital learning activities out there that he would enjoy doing if you could just expose him to them. Look on Teacher Pay Teacher, for example. Look for stuff like escape rooms and mysteries as well as language arts activities. Take back the reins and I‚Äôm sure this kid will come around.  But first get his parents to back you up."
ElementaryTeachers,Hello. I teach 3rd Grade in Maryland. I can have a short conversation over the phone of Zoom if that works for you. I am free M-F after 3:15. Let me know and I can PM you.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! I found a lot of read to me book websites but I was really hoping to find an interactive one that makes the children think. Maybe it will be invented by time I am a teacher haha! Thanks for the help!
ElementaryTeachers,"The survey has now ended! Thank you to all who participated. Please check your emails and possibly junk folders for access to your gift cards today and tomorrow.

If you have any more questions please email us at [info@picscience.com](mailto:info@picscience.com)"
ElementaryTeachers,"You could easily make this in GoogleSlides. But there‚Äôs tons of Read To Me websites for kids, and a lot of them are free due to covid. My school uses Epic (getepic) so that‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôm familiar with, but I haven‚Äôt seen that feature."
ElementaryTeachers,"I wish I could! Since coronavirus the parents aren't allowed in the building so they call the site manager and he, the one who yelled at me about my sarcasm and my tone of voice with the kids, walks them out"
ElementaryTeachers,Talk to their parents so they get consequences at home if you tell them a bad report?
ElementaryTeachers,"CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT STARTER KIT with Huge Rules, Routines, and Expectations Bundle

ElementaryTeachers,"It's the first day of school, and the teacher doesn't know the kids in the class or what they're like. The seating is based on a lot of factors you don't know about, and we don't just seat students with behaviour challenges at the front of the class. We seat based off of **legally protected** IEPs, and if a child has an accomodation to be at the front or the back or away from reflective materials or windows, we abide by that. 

Even if kids had poor behaviour the year before, we don't like to label kids as ""bad"" first off because behaviour can change as they age or over the summer. 

Also, I strongly take issue to your statement ""the few kids that can excel"" because **all kids have potential** and it is not genetically determined that some will and some won't.

While you are looking out for the best interests of your one child, the teacher is trying to create a positive learning environment for *all* 20-30 students in the class. This includes not labelling some as bad or unable to learn.

The other thing we work on is teaching children to be assertive and manage their own social-emotional regulation in school. Your daughter may actually benefit from sitting next to a less-preferred seatmate and having some coaching on how to work on telling her peers if they are annoying her or being rude, especially as she gets older, and how to problem solve.

Don't project your own experiences on your daughter, and don't forget that schools have changed massively. Try engaging in a measured conversation with the teacher and also understanding that it is about the needs of the many, and remember toy do not have the full picture."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much for this advice! I‚Äôm going to take all three separately at the end of September. I also have already taken and passed the CBEST so hopefully that will help in my preparation as well as looking at different study resources and books.
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes this is definitely true, many schools said they were waving the CSET this year due to COVID, however I had a friend who applied to the CSU school I attend for the credential program (I‚Äôm still working towards my bachelors), &amp; he said they passed him over because he didn‚Äôt have his CSET. When he asked why he didn‚Äôt get accepted, they said they just had way too many applicants and they had to choose the most qualified people. 
TL,DR: take your required tests, even if the school(s) you‚Äôre applying to tell you they‚Äôre not necessary."
ElementaryTeachers,"If it's the first day of school the seats were almost certainly random so this teacher isn't doing anything to your daughter on purpose.
Just talk to the teacher about your concerns and see if she can be moved somewhere else in the room."
ElementaryTeachers,Okay thank you for the advice!
ElementaryTeachers,"For some reason my Reddit isn‚Äôt letting me reply to your comment so I‚Äôm just writing this here. 


This year, because of Covid, CSETs were not required immediately at the time of applying. I‚Äôm not sure how it will be this year. Every school‚Äôs application has a different requirement on that. You need to declare what credential you want anyways, ex. Single subject bio credential, multiple subjects credential, etc. so you might as well take the CSETs you need when applying or before applying. The credential program is pretty busy anyway, so you would want to be focusing on that during the program rather than the CSETs."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for the advice. I have already taken the CBEST this summer. Do you know if I have to take the CSET‚Äôs before applying to a credential program or can I just take them while I am doing my program?
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe try to have a discussion with the concerned school/teacher? Communication is important and here it seems you‚Äôre just venting which will not resolve your daughter‚Äôs situation.
ElementaryTeachers,"First, you should make sure your tests are in order, like the CBEST and CSET‚Äôs. There are other ways to satisfy these requirements, but I found it easier just to take the tests rather than dig up my old SAT score and whatnot. No need to take any ‚Äúpre-teaching‚Äù courses because each program requires different prerequisite courses. 


Then, you just look up schools in CA that have teaching credential programs. Choose a few that you like or have researched, then check when applications for the next instruction period are open. I suggest starting the application process as soon as you‚Äôre able because different programs require different things such as prerequisite courses or certain certifications like CPR and livescan. 


Finally, stay on top of your email for updates, such as interviews or other materials you need to provide, and then hope for the best :)

Best of luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks so much! I have heard a lot that a special ed license helps a lot, even if you aren‚Äôt planning to go into special ed, so that‚Äôs definitely something I‚Äôm planning on looking into after I graduate when I go into a teacher certification program :)."
ElementaryTeachers,"Math minor would help more. But it does depend on your area. In my district, you're more desirable if you have an ELL/ESOL/CLD or special education license."
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks very much for your reply!
ElementaryTeachers,How'd it go?
ElementaryTeachers,"
 1. What grade level do you teach and what standards are you using?

3rd, Utah Core.

 2. What kinds of diverse learners are in your class this year?

Huge spread. 5 nationalities, 4 languages spoken. Title 1.

 3. How do you assess which students are diverse learners?

Reading fluency scores, comprehension tests, computer based learning progress, direct one on one formative assessments.

 4. How would you describe the health and wellness of your students?

There are a few that are grossly overweight but most are fairly healthy.

 5. What negatively impacts the students‚Äô health and wellness at school?

The school is where a lot of them get the most nutrition. And we create a pretty safe environment for them. I can't point to anything negative about their time in school that would impact their health and wellness.

 6. What negatively impacts the students‚Äô health and wellness outside of school?

Troubled home lives. Living in homeless shelters, out of cars, moving a lot. Not having the opportunity to practice english.

 7. How do you, as the teacher, support the health and wellness of the students?

Lead by example. Stay healthy. Talk about things that impact their health. Second Steps social and emotional program is good.

 8. What activities do you incorporate to support your diverse learners?

I provide a variety of levels where students at multiple levels of ability can learn and demonstrate improvement.

 9. What do you wish you had known and prepared for as a teacher of diverse learners? 

I felt I was pretty prepared. My education had a strong focus on tapping into the funds of knowledge that can be found in students homes, cultures and experiences."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! This helps
ElementaryTeachers,"Don‚Äôt be afraid to take a centering moment in the middle of the class. For example, take some deep breaths before beginning a lesson or lecture. Once students begin independent work sit at your desk for a minute to collect yourself and take some more breaths before getting up and moving to check on and help students. Drink your comfort beverage of choice throughout the day (coffee, tea, water soda or a combination) even better if you put it in a cute cup or mug. Get the kids moving or transitioning through the block via brain breaks or group work or a gallery walk or anything. They would appreciate the break too and it gives you a break as well. If you‚Äôre having disciplinary or management issues take a few breaths before addressing it to calm yourself and avoid over reacting or yelling or anything unproductive. And most of all keep things simple. it‚Äôs your first year you don‚Äôt need every lesson and every class to be the most exciting engaging multi modal lesson they‚Äôve ever seen every day. Build simple and consistent routines and soon you and your students will breeze through the blocks in both halves of the day."
ElementaryTeachers,No worries and good luck! Happy to help :)
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! I learned a lot from your answers and am already finishing up my assignment based on this interview. I appreciate your help :)
ElementaryTeachers,"&gt;1. What grade level do you teach and what standards are you using?

I teach grade 2 and I use the British National Curriculum for Literacy, and the Australian Maths curriculum. For Social Studies/Science I use IPC. 

&gt;2. What kinds of diverse learners are in your class this year?

One autistic student, two EAL learners, and one anxious student so far (from last year's assessment). We'll see what else I have next week. A lot is caught in Grade 2. 

&gt;3. How do you assess which students are diverse learners?

Data data data. I do a preliminary basic assessment in the first weeks with observation and tracking (looking for difficulties writing, listening, doing math, with behaviour, inconsistencies between subjects, sensory red flags, and following directions) and then I have a basic referral form that asks for more detail and examples. I also have a writing and math diagnostic assessment that's a hodgepodge. I have some OG materials for reading. I also talk to parents.

&gt;4. How would you describe the health and wellness of your students?

Good. They are generally higher SES as it's private schooling.  Some are emotionally neglected to some degree. Most have poor diets (sugary snacks, all carbs). Some are not active enough.

&gt;5. What negatively impacts the students‚Äô health and wellness at school?

Lack of consistency due to covid is the big one. 

&gt;6. What negatively impacts the students‚Äô health and wellness outside of school?

Lack of activity, sometimes poor parental engagement or the flip side, too much parental engagement. My students tend to lack independence and problem-solving skills.

&gt;7. How do you, as the teacher, support the health and wellness of the students?

We educate on SEL, diet, and incorporate movement in. We have a routine. 

&gt;8. What activities do you incorporate to support your diverse learners?

Daily multiple movement breaks, routine, explicit SEL curriculum (Second Step), and lots of encouragement.

&gt;9. What do you wish you had known and prepared for as a teacher of diverse learners?

I really think education programs should do more on disabilities and how to accomodate and read/build an IEP. Less siloed specialities would be better - there is no reason a classroom teacher shouldn't incorporate basic OT, SLP, etc."
ElementaryTeachers,As long as it pays my bills I‚Äôm not worried. Not looking to become rich or anything. Just make the money I need and do what excites me
ElementaryTeachers,I make 40k first year teaching in Tennessee
ElementaryTeachers,Where??? Spring ISD pays 58k to 1st year teachers
ElementaryTeachers,"Keep in mind that if you have to take out loans, even making mid 30s might stretch you pretty thin."
ElementaryTeachers,It really depends where you‚Äôre at. My mom has been a teacher for 30+ years and got multiple certifications and two masters degrees and she is at 65k
ElementaryTeachers,"When I worked in childcare I made about $24,000 a year. My sister is an elementary school teacher in Washington state and she makes $80,000 a year. Many states now pay their teachers better than others, so you need to look into it state by state. Washington state has a flat rate that they start you out at, she‚Äôs been doing it for 20 years, so you won‚Äôt start out at 80, but certainly more than 20."
ElementaryTeachers,Invest in crypto
ElementaryTeachers,"Teacher pensions are not nearly as great as they used to be, at least in my state. More like half of what they used to be."
ElementaryTeachers,"20k? Lmao, my dad earns 12k a year if we're lucky, ya'll better enjoy with what you have"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, my mom was an intervention aide, no college degree and worked part time - made around 20k. (Retired last year) teachers in the same district make 40-100 depending on education, subject and seniority."
ElementaryTeachers,"Depends on where you live. My aunt worked at an elementary school in rural Illinois for years and only made about 20k by the time she left. 

I teach elementary school in Boston and I started at about 55k. With a masters degree, extra credits, and a solid amount of years teaching, Boston teachers can get to the six figures. I think I‚Äôm in the high seventies or low eighties now."
ElementaryTeachers,"In AZ, I started at a public charter school teacher K-8 music at $35.5k.


In NJ, I started at a K-12 private school for $43k which wasn‚Äôt enough to live alone on.


I‚Äôm now seven years in at a Title One public school making just under 60k. And I‚Äôm still a music teacher if that helps any. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Starting pay is around 40k for elementary teachers in NC now. 

Source: wife is an elementary school teacher, this is her 2nd year teaching."
ElementaryTeachers,Most school public districts you can actually look at staff pay. The school my kids go to they make way more than 20k
ElementaryTeachers,"The average teachers salary ranges greatly depending on where you‚Äôre located ‚Ä¶ but remember it‚Äôs just the starting salary‚Ä¶ the salary will likely increase as you gain tenure and experience.  Google avg teachers salary for your area‚Ä¶ nationally it‚Äôs about 24k to as much as 60k or higher. 

Private school teachers make even more on average because of funding ‚Ä¶ daycare a s preschool teachers make less on average 

The bottom line is, if you want to teach‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt let someone‚Äôs negative and generalized comment stop you from changing course and regretting your decision later.  Many ppl go to college and don‚Äôt know what they want to do ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd you have a sense of purpose follow that instinct.  Also‚Ä¶ teaching can open doors for other things down the line ‚Ä¶ Google career paths or career transitions for teachers ‚Ä¶ you can eventually become a principal, superintendent‚Ä¶ private tutor ‚Ä¶ course instructors outside of traditional school‚Ä¶ teaching is a valuable skill to have under your belt ‚Ä¶ and you get to have summers off ‚Ä¶ if you love the idea of teaching follow that path ‚Ä¶ just be sure to educate yourself on alternative options in the teaching field if you decide to change paths."
ElementaryTeachers,You could ask her to support her claim with evidence &amp; counter argue with research online.
ElementaryTeachers,"Florida is $46,800.00 starting base."
ElementaryTeachers,"Come on over! WA state, Seattle area!"
ElementaryTeachers,Dang! I wanna teach where you‚Äôre teaching!
ElementaryTeachers,"Depends on your area. 

I am a U.S. public school teacher with a MA and 12 years of teaching experience. I gross 109k per year."
ElementaryTeachers,"I make 53k in my 2nd year at the moment. I‚Äôm teaching in a title 1, elementary school for context."
ElementaryTeachers,I live in a house that my fianc√© already owns and don‚Äôt plan on having kids
ElementaryTeachers,"Something to think about is that 24k is fine for a single childless person.  If you want to raise a family, buy a home, travel a bit‚Ä¶.maybe not.   I don‚Äôt want to discourage you in any way, but that‚Äôs something I see lots of young people not consider."
ElementaryTeachers,Texas is 34k first year
ElementaryTeachers,"There are dramatic differences in pay between districts, states and locations in a state. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have trouble making more than 20k if you have any flexibility in where you work and shop different job offers. I can‚Äôt imagine daycare teachers in most places making more money."
ElementaryTeachers,No not true at all.
ElementaryTeachers,Please teach your kids how to readüôèüèª my Lil cousin just started 3rd grade and none of his teachers bother to teach him
ElementaryTeachers,Don't sleep with any of the students
ElementaryTeachers,"I don‚Äôt know any teachers that make 20k. Teacher aides can make around 20k, but full time first year teachers in the districts I‚Äôve worked make 35-40k"
ElementaryTeachers,"You will *feel* wealthier than your wildest dreams, good elementary teachers are basically rockstars in their students' eyes."
ElementaryTeachers,"Google ""district name salary schedule"" 

It will come up with a pdf of the pay scale for the district your looking for. Teachers can move up the pay scale with teaching experience and education level."
ElementaryTeachers,Modeling behaviors is sooooo important in all grades but especially elementary. This is great advice.
ElementaryTeachers,"Accept constructive criticism from others. You don‚Äôt know everything. 

I thought I was a huge know it all when I was student teacher/first two years of teaching. I def needed some humility ü§£ 

Also kids (no matter the grade) need instructions of EVERYTHING. I still cringe thinking about how I had centers for 3rd grade and a student asked me how to play this game and I told her ‚Äúwell the instructions are there you should be able to figure it out‚Äù üò®"
ElementaryTeachers,I am a kindergarten teacher sitting at 60k with 4 years of experience
ElementaryTeachers,well i can assure u that as time goes on you won‚Äôt have to worry abt the future or worry abt breaking ur leg and being in medical debt for the rest of ur life. and who knows 10 years down the line i‚Äôve seen teachers that make 6 figures cuz they get stipends for doing extra curricular activities like sports and stuff
ElementaryTeachers,I didn‚Äôt want to become rich. I work at Walmart right now and I hate it there. Thinking about becoming a teacher excites me fuels me. I watch teacher youtubers all day bc I‚Äôm that excited. I shelved the idea when I dropped out of high school cause I figured I wouldn‚Äôt ever finish high school but I did it and now I want to go to college to get a degree and do something i love and that excites me. I figure being a teacher isn‚Äôt gonna put me in a Tesla or a mansion but it‚Äôs gonna be the career I want to be in and I‚Äôll make the money I need to live my usual life.
ElementaryTeachers,"lol 20 a year is extremely underestimated even for a starting pay. and the pay isn‚Äôt gonna make u rich but the benefits are amazing so long as u work for a state run school like a public school or something. they have rlly strong unions, nice pensions and good health insurance"
ElementaryTeachers,That‚Äôs perfect. I told her I didn‚Äôt really care about the money. It was about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Obviously getting paid to work is 1 thing. But I‚Äôm not looking to become rich or anything. I just don‚Äôt want to work retail forever
ElementaryTeachers,"Yea, you will likely make more than that. I taught in neighboring NC and started at like 32k in my district. And that was in 2011. I don't teach anymore, but the starting pay is higher than it was back then. Best of luck if you decide to pursue it!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I just started as a Kindergarten teacher at a private religious school in a city with a population of about 100K and my salary is $21K. I have a friend who just started as a public school first grade teacher in a neighboring rural town and I think she is making low to mid 30s. For context I am in Colorado. From what I've seen here, I think it's more likely you'd start in the 30 thousands as a first year public school teacher."
ElementaryTeachers,"I work at Walmart in Tennessee rn and make 24 a year which is plenty. If I make that much at least, I‚Äôll be fine. üòÖ I just had to ask you all cause she was really fighting me on all that"
ElementaryTeachers,"It definitely depends where you are teaching, if the school is public vs. private vs. charter etc., and what your most advanced degree is.

For example, many private or charter schools in the U.S. pay less than public schools. And if you have a masters degree you will generally make more than with a bachelors. States like CA, MA, and NY are known for paying teachers more, whereas states in the South often (but not always) have a lower starting salary than those in the Northeast or PNW."
ElementaryTeachers,"You should be able to find the salary rates for almost any school district online. Just browse the various school districts in your area (or the area you think you want to teach in) and find the pay grades. It will show how much teachers are paid based on years of experience. 

But to answer your question more directly, if you are in the US, you almost certainly will make more than 20k starting out. It may not be much more depending on your state, but it will be more than 20."
ElementaryTeachers,It depends on several factors- the state and sometimes even in the school as well as your education level and a number of years teaching.
ElementaryTeachers,Lots of ‚Äú when completing this activity who can remind me what our room should sound like?‚Äù You get the idea. Have The kiddos repeat your expectations to you and if it‚Äôs something that involves moving have one of them act it out before the rest give it a try.  You got this!!!
ElementaryTeachers,"Try your best to be calm, patient, and try to get to know them. I used to volunteer and help 1st graders once a week for a year. 1st day was a mess. But after every week went on I got to know what kids needed help with the most and how to approach them. I‚Äôm sure everything will work out. Good luck!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Take advantage of your recess and lunch breaks! I didn‚Äôt at first and burnt out really quickly. Also write down little things your master teacher says that you see work and want to repeat/try yourself. For example, redirecting behaviors or encouraging learning phrases."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôd get a notebook and jot down what worked, what didn‚Äôt work. Nothing fancy, just bullet point what you did. 

Review behavior expectations and rules before you start your lesson!! You got this!"
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶ but you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know.. so don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself and learn from your mistakes. :-) good luck!
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for watching!
ElementaryTeachers,I'm not one of those people but many of my colleagues are. It's different with your students. Give it a try. Substituting is great advice.
ElementaryTeachers,Go for it! But be careful to use working as a substitute to see how it is at school as a teacher. I am a sub - it is hard. You do not have the long term role and relationships the teacher has. I do learn a lot from working as a teacher assistant/ aide. That would give you a better idea of what it is like in a classroom.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hated school, hate being the Centre of attention, hate speaking in front of a group.  Love being an elementary school teacher.  It‚Äôs different."
ElementaryTeachers,That casual thinking makes me feel very at ease about it. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ElementaryTeachers,You can‚Äôt knock it till you try it
ElementaryTeachers,"I think teaching a group of kids is quite different from public speaking because you can move around, pass papers out, and interact with students in an informal, laid back classroom environment. And if you practice each day, you probably get really comfortable with the kids."
ElementaryTeachers,You're welcome.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you, this is a great idea! I‚Äôm a long-term sub and have been wanting to find these kind of warm up videos for the kids."
ElementaryTeachers,Came here to recommend this exact book.
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yardsticks: Child and Adolescent Development Ages 4-14

Hands down my favorite resource - helpful for teacher and parents and seems like exactly what you‚Äôre looking for!"
ElementaryTeachers,give tickets for doing good then do a drawing for a treasure chest on fridays
ElementaryTeachers,Epraise?
ElementaryTeachers,Names on kids on the wall and whoever misbehave gets a warning. 3 warnings and it's a detention or break time in the classroom.
ElementaryTeachers,PBIS
ElementaryTeachers,She should talk with her coworkers and admin. Every school I‚Äôve ever been with has had a strict school wide behavior system. So they probably have something already in place that she needs to be using.
ElementaryTeachers,"Used to do a half sheet kids took home daily for their parents. Everyone got to give themselves a check mark for having a decent day, if they had a rough day they would instead draw a red circle and then have to write a letter to their parents explaining what happened and what were better choices they could make next time. They needed to return it the next day signed. Also, I generally always texted parents as a heads up so they knew it had been addressed in class and  to have a discussion with their child. Every 20 good behavior check marks they got a prize from the prize box (generally small things or snacks) and we had a weekly ‚Äúfun Friday‚Äù as extra incentive. It‚Äôs been a pretty ez system to keep up."
ElementaryTeachers,I absolutely love ClassDojo. I have a store kids can spend their dojo points at to receive cool knickknacks and stickers. Do I need to focus on negative behavior when you can celebrate positive.
ElementaryTeachers,Classdojo
ElementaryTeachers,I think tracking all good and bad behavior is a major task. I have my students names on a clip board. I put a tally by their name if I have to give them a reminder to get on track. I seriously reflect on student behavior and strategies when a student receives 4 reminders in one day. She can track positive behavior on an app like class dojo to give students points.
ElementaryTeachers,"With the upper grades, I keep a binder called the ""Choices Book."" Students each have a numbered section to flip to for their personal log. They log ""glows"" and ""grows,"" so if an individual is sent to the log, others don't always know if it is a positive ""glow"" or a consequence (room to grow). The log includes date, what happened, and reward/consequence. If they need to work on something, like walking instead of running or respecting others, they take a colored ""choices ticket"" (1/4 sheet of paper with lines) and fill it out with what choice they made (bad behavior) and how they will work on making a better choice next time. Depending on the infraction, they may need a parent signature on their ticket. Since the students are responsible for their own logs, this is a great tool to have at conferences to show parents or SSP teams how the behavior in class is.

When students get 3 glows, they get to choose from the prize box.

For the lower grades, I like using Class Dojo. I don't show points to the whole class, but boy do kids respond when they hear the +1 sounds and the -1 sound. I like this free online program as I can use my phone or computer and update points from anywhere in the room. Center time, if they hear a good chime, they all smile and get focused and working. If they hear a bad chime, they hunker down and work."
ElementaryTeachers,Yes to love and logic.
ElementaryTeachers,"I don't really track behaviors so stringently, but as a new teacher I did. Privacy is huge. I did cards and would hole punch for infractions one year. Most years I just have had a class list and given ""checks"" for infractions. We would do a ticket drawing every week. If you got three checks in a day you would lose your ticket for the day and get a note home.
If she is looking for more resources for discipline I highly recommend Teaching with Love and Logic."
ElementaryTeachers,She could try a sticker chart/grid at their desk or somewhere private. (Catcha or Caught Ya Being Good charts.) She can check in with those students at the end of the day privately to see how they‚Äôre doing. It helps to have agreed upon goals that the students are partners in creating (even if they are guided towards those goals by the teacher). 4th graders are are developmentally ready for more accountability and agency. They like knowing specific goals and working towards them.

ElementaryTeachers,"So in principle, I do agree. Being punitive rarely leads to wholesale change, and there are no doubt places where the consequence is disproportionate to the behaviour. The thing is though, that there is a middle ground between ""chewing gum"" and ""guns and drugs."" Chronic disruption, for instance. Vandalism. Racial or homophobic insults. In Ontario, any of these would be reasons to consider suspension, though mitigating factors should be considered.

Plus, honestly, kids are sometimes suspended because the teacher and/or the rest of the class need a break."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much! I appreciate your help!
ElementaryTeachers,I just did it!! Great questions. I recommend if you have a moment to fill it out.
ElementaryTeachers,I know this is an old comment but I‚Äôm gonna out in my two cents. It‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt realize that we actually learn how to teach stuff. They think ‚Äòoh I know how to read!‚Äô And not ‚ÄòI have no idea how to make someone else read‚Äô like I think they genuinely believe that elementary teacher school is just learning like elementary math and nowhere in there is teaching it or why we‚Äôre teaching it.
ElementaryTeachers,Excellent counsel. Thanks for adding more detail.
ElementaryTeachers,"I attended for a semester. Then went to an in person program at Pacific University.  I am in OR.  I do know of others that attended this program.  I don't recall how they felt about it. 
Good luck. 

Stay off of social media when you are teaching is my best advice. Or at least don't share negative opinions about curriculum. The news re: Massachusetts teacher who got canned for sharing her views recently. 

Stay well."
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks I may do that
ElementaryTeachers,I currently am. Feel free to DM me about it!
ElementaryTeachers,Will take a look. Did you attend or do you know someone who did? Thanks
ElementaryTeachers,Did you attend and can you teach in your state? This one is to be considered but there are so many negative reviews and a class action suit.
ElementaryTeachers,Grand Canyon... it was ok. Check that Mass accepts it of course
ElementaryTeachers,Western Governor‚Äôs University
ElementaryTeachers,"Once you finish your bachelors program, you will need to apply to a teaching program. Once in the program you will start student teaching and take your exams/ requirements based on your state. Since your BA is in elementary education I am assuming the majority of your class will be going straight into a teaching program post-grad."
ElementaryTeachers,This is what they are. If they are all the same they are pattern blocks. If they are all different they are attribute blocks. They are typically used in K-3.
ElementaryTeachers,"Your college should've been doing this for you. Most states have you do student teaching and then your university recommends you to be licensed by the state. 

I would contact the school you got your BA from."
ElementaryTeachers,Louisiana. I saw it requires a state license to teach in public schools here but they were kinda eh on answering these questions.
ElementaryTeachers,"Which state are you in? I would advise talking to your student teaching supervisor, advisor, or another professor that understands the licensure process in your state"
ElementaryTeachers,So for first grade 1.G.2 in the common core standards is to make new shapes with other shapes and I give my kids these and tell them to make shapes and pictures with them.
ElementaryTeachers,Nice! Sounds like a good way to use them. Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,"In 4th grade we use blocks like these in geometry. We give the kids a baggie and they have to do stuff like ‚Äúfind the quadrilateral,‚Äù ‚Äúfind a shape with an acute/right/obtuse angle,‚Äù etc."
ElementaryTeachers,Attribute blocks. What a score!
ElementaryTeachers,"Tangrams, possibly."
ElementaryTeachers,I just looked up attribute blocks. It's seems to be a match! Thank you for helping me figure out what do with these. üòÉ
ElementaryTeachers,"Some of these look like attribute blocks. They come in different shapes, colours and thickness and you can use them for sorting and patterning, but it also looks like there might be some pattern blocks mixed in there as well."
ElementaryTeachers,"Reminds me of a comic i saw a while back.  The teacher is talking to his class, explaining that in English, as well as many other languages, using two negatives can mean a positive.  He goes on to say that luckily, in no language, does a double positive mean a negative.  The smart @$$ in the back of the class blurts out, ""Yea, right!""  Double positive.  Means a negative.  LOL"
ElementaryTeachers,"If you want to pull small groups, are there other activities the rest of the students could be working on that they can do on their own?  Perhaps setting up some stations to keep them busy and productive?"
ElementaryTeachers,"Try Khan Academy. it's free, and they have some well-made early math videos.  When my ""little one"" was in kindergarten (she's now a high school freshman) and she was having a problem understanding what a number line was all about, I played her the video on Khan Academy, and in less than a minute she had it!  Sometimes it is just a matter of having someone else present the same information in a different voice that makes all the difference.

If you Google ""Khan Academy ones and tens"" you should get a link to the videos.

Or just follow this link:  [Khan Academy ones and tens](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-1st-grade-math/cc-1st-place-value/cc-1st-ones-tens/v/place-value-introduction)

ElementaryTeachers,It definitely can be a lot! Hopefully this next month I'll get a better hang of things... I'm in Iowa!
ElementaryTeachers,It‚Äôs great but challenging for sure. I‚Äôm in northern ca. You?
ElementaryTeachers,Woohoo! How do you like it so far? Where do you teach?
ElementaryTeachers,"First year, first-grade teacher here!"
ElementaryTeachers,"This reading assignment was recommended to me by my team-teacher, who I've often thought of as a lazy teacher with nasty habits and I think that her teaching instincts are off by a country mile.  Forget about the fact that it's text only with no pictures to supplement context.  The words themselves and the concepts behind them would not be familiar to your typical 4th grader.  I've always had to rely on my own instincts and opinions of other co-workers which weren't always descriptive; it's good to hear objective opinions from you all here. Thank you.  I feel vindicated."
ElementaryTeachers,"The acronyms tell me this is a recent college grad and this is how they were taught. Feels very sterile like a college paper would. 

The subject matter is fine, the presentation needs a lot of work."
ElementaryTeachers,Way too hard for fourth
ElementaryTeachers,"I wouldn't even say this is appropriate for a 4th grader who speaks English natively. Maybe at the end of the year? This is more of a 5th/6th grade level, but for non-native speakers it might even be higher than that."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yep, this was my opinion as well.

Thank you for your input.  It bolsters my initial thoughts as well."
ElementaryTeachers,"I wonder if the variety of vocab might be too advanced. Would your students be able to differentiate between producers and produce? Words like premium, handicrafts, charitable, foundation, all might stump native 4th grade English speakers, let alone non-native ones."
ElementaryTeachers,"This seems quite advanced for 4th grade. 
Any 4th grade."
ElementaryTeachers,"Exactly what u/paintedbillboard said. When they get the test, it will look something like this: 

What does the root **mono-** mean in the word **mono**cycle?

Or two columns with a selection of roots on one side and a list of definitions on the other, and instructions which state to connect the root with its definition

Or a collection of roots and then a fill in the blank ‚Äúmadlib‚Äù style sentence, with instructions to use the correct root for the meaning. Ex.: I love to ride my ___cycle. Choices: mono- , ulti- , centi-, multi- , mega-"
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,"IDK, I think the subjective assumption of ‚Äúshaming‚Äù might be a bit much. The teacher doesn‚Äôt read out student names who *didn‚Äôt* get 100% with a score they got; the teacher only reads the names of ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù. Publicly acknowledge a job well-done to those who earned it, and give everyone else an opportunity to try again for pride of accomplishment of being on the list of achievers next week. 

What‚Äôs the problem with that? Some teachers have treat jars or ‚Äúpool‚Äù jars which encourage teamwork, some throw in a bit of friendly competition‚Ä¶ 

My kids never got their 100% vocab tests back either; only when they missed any words so they (and the parents) would know which ones to spend extra time studying."
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach third and this isn‚Äôt outside our realm of learning.  It‚Äôs in our standards and I do a ton of work on Greek and Latin roots and how to break words down into their parts to understand meaning.

You arent learning words, you are learning a root (like mono meaning one) and then learning what the second part of the word means.  Lingual means language, one language.  Chrome is color, one color.  It‚Äôs actually pretty simple.  The kids pick this stuff pretty easily.

I don‚Äôt do vocab tests, but I could totally see doing work like this at our grade level.  

I also do what she does with spelling tests.  If you get an A+ on the practice test you don‚Äôt need to take the final.  I don‚Äôt publicly tell everyone but I do post how much each kid reads each week.  A little social motivation and competition works really well at this age.  I definitely don‚Äôt shame though."
ElementaryTeachers,Agreed. Learning the meaning of different word parts in order to be able to decipher a new composite word is on par with 3rd and 4th grade skills
ElementaryTeachers,5th
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you, this is what I need to know!  And I love your state, I grew up there and went to CSU."
ElementaryTeachers,"Just a heads up. In most states, 'decoding words with Latin prefixes' is included in 3rd-grade reading standards. [Here's my states 3rd grade reading standards, for reference.](https://www.cde.state.co.us/apps/standards/6,5,19) Your child should be learning the tools to decode words that *seem* difficult but can be easily separated into parts to determine their meaning. And most vocab lists like this are included in the curriculum, and not created by the teacher. 

The teacher's instruction may be questionable (I have no idea), but the words themselves are likely appropriate."
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,I would give this to my 6th graders. Definitely not 3rd grade unless it was to challenge some kids who were ready for it.
ElementaryTeachers,Seriously. What are you worried she's missing out on based on this homework as claimed in another comment?
ElementaryTeachers,Just wow
ElementaryTeachers,"Seems about right for 4th/5th. 

If I were the teacher and you came to me about this being 'off,' I'd probably stop sending anything home, period. 

This is one aspect of a whole curriculum. Be happy your kid is getting a quality education."
ElementaryTeachers,"Ya, i do not like that she is calling out the names. That will only divide and hurt the kids. Best of luck to you with your conversation with the principal!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you!  The teacher is giving the weekly test and then reading out a list of names of the kids who got 100% in class and saying ‚Äúthese students got 100% and don‚Äôt have vocabulary for next week, the rest of you have to study those same words and take another test next week‚Äù.  She also states it in Class Dojo without a names list.  She doesn‚Äôt send home the test, so I have to trust my daughter when she says she got 100 because grades aren‚Äôt posted until the 2nd test.  It makes my stomach drop for those other kids because it seems like shaming to me.  This is a tough year for parents as well as teachers so I was trying to give it a minute to maybe smooth out but it just isn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm going to have to talk to the principal tomorrow.  Thanks for your input and your apology"
ElementaryTeachers,As a fourth grade teacher this is fourth
ElementaryTeachers,"Sorry, i didnt mean to imply you were giving your child excuses to give up or not trying to help them or anything of that nature! Sorry it came off that way. I was just saying that as a general statement. I believe,  as part of a new way of approaching education,  its not negative to see how far you can push education.  It could be that the teacher felt the class, or maybe just a few of the children,  could potentially handle this type of work. When my son was 7 the teacher just kept giving harder and harder assignments,  in a fun manner, just see how high they could go. At first, i was apprehensive about it, but afterwards we realized how much more they can handle. I attribute that teacher to a lot of my sons early success in school. It helped him develop better study habits that were far beyond what i could have envisioned. I do see the concern or second guessing of such material.  Also, i will add, the teacher could be doing this out of... spite, for a lack of a better word. In my opinion,  if the teacher is just trying to push the limits, in a ""fun"" experimental way, its ok push for it. If the teacher is just being a jerk than its a problem and i could see it discouraging the children.  
Anyways. I apologize for how it sounded.  I was in no way trying to say anyone here is a bad parent or anything to that level."
ElementaryTeachers,"If think 3rd-4th grade. I remember learning Roman numberals, Latin prefixes and beginning algebra in third grade.

Also, I‚Äôm 28 if that gives an idea of how long it has been since that age."
ElementaryTeachers,"It‚Äôs not that my child can‚Äôt do it or needs new study methods, she gets A‚Äôs on all her tests because we memorize.  My concern is that if this is ‚Äúoff‚Äù, what is she missing out on learning?  Let me be more than clear in stating that I am not in any way teaching my child to make excuses or put in less effort.  Nothing about my questioning this involves failure.  I recognize and give my kids credit for their intelligence.   Having four kids with the oldest just turning 26, I‚Äôve seen my fair share of vocabulary lists and this doesn‚Äôt seem right, so I‚Äôm here asking.  Sometimes responsible parents question things and shouldn‚Äôt be talked down to for doing so."
ElementaryTeachers,No way this is third grade.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôd say it depends on what they‚Äôre expected to know. If this is JUST to teach the prefix ‚Äúmono-‚Äú and the words are only examples, why not squeeze in some real-world exposure? There are only so many words that start with mono. 

If they need to be able to remember/spell/write these, it‚Äôs a bit much. My 3rd graders would have a difficult time with most of them"
ElementaryTeachers,"This is definitely elementary school material. Look at the words. They only have to focus on the last half of the word. Kids are smarter than you are giving them credit for, especially nowadays.  Kids are coding games and apps in elementary school. Also, teachers have to push students to do the best they can. Things like this help parents and teachers understand where their child is at. If your child can not do it, perhaps you should help them start to develop a better way to study. Do not put into their young mind that they have an excuse not to try as hard as they can. Failure happens."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you!!!  I will talk to the principal!
ElementaryTeachers,Oh my god. There is no way this is G3 appropriate. Talk to the principal. That is ridiculous.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for responding!!!  My 3rd grader is getting these lists.  I have asked the teacher why, because I feel it‚Äôs far beyond grade level.  I‚Äôm not sure how to get someone to look into this, the whole class is doing terribly with it.  This is the third list this year, the other two include words like posthumous, postmortem (?!), postindustrial.  I want to support the teacher but I can‚Äôt let my daughter feel like she isn‚Äôt smart enough to get her vocabulary list either.  She‚Äôs getting A‚Äôs, but only because we work on memorizing daily.  Any advice would be appreciated!"
ElementaryTeachers,What? This is odd. Not elementary.
ElementaryTeachers,This age also loves to help and are usually friends all around--less social drama than older grades
ElementaryTeachers,I get that! I have some students that are well below grade level and it‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm not in a ‚Äútesting grade‚Äù which is why I don‚Äôt want to go above 2nd grade. It sounds like kinder is the best fit for you though so I say go for it!
ElementaryTeachers,"I've also thought 2nd grade might be a good stepping stone toward the primary grades, but I'm so burnt out on the rigorous reading comprehension of 3rd grade that I'm nervous 2nd grade will be too similar for me to enjoy. I'm truly looking for something different than what I'm used to. I miss when I was in college and had the experience of teaching little firsties their foundational reading skills. Those experiences are pulling me towards 1st."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for your perspective!
ElementaryTeachers,"This is what makes me love the idea of kindergarten, too! I know it's a lot classroom management-wise to teach kids so young, but I love the foundational content that is taught in kinder and I love how there is the possibility for adding more playtime during the day. I'm so burnt out on teaching 3rd-grade content."
ElementaryTeachers,"I spent a year in kindergarten for about one hour per day when I was a high school senior. That experience was what made me want to become a teacher. I really loved helping kids learn the very beginning, foundational skills. In college, I spent more time doing intern work in 1st grade, and again I loved the content I was teaching.

I honestly feel burnt out on teaching the rigorous reading comprehension of 3rd grade. I'm exhausted with the level of difficulty the content is for my students who are mostly below grade level--many on a 1st-grade or even kindergarten reading level. I honestly just want to be able to go back to teaching the foundations of phonemic awareness, phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, etc. That's what mostly is pushing me toward primary grades. I am nervous that if I go for 2nd, it will feel too close to what 3rd grade feels like."
ElementaryTeachers,2nd would be a good transition. I taught 2nd for years before moving to 3rd this year. There is a big difference in independence.
ElementaryTeachers,"I've taught K and 1. I love K because the schedule allows a little more play time, which they need. But mostly because I get to teach non-readers how to read."
ElementaryTeachers,"Out of those choices, definitely 2nd. I taught &amp; subbed 1st grade &amp;  have spent a majority of my career teaching 2nd. There's such a huge difference! I'll never teach anything below 2nd."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve had experience in K, 1st, and 2nd. My kinder experience was a senior internship during the 2nd half of the year which was great (I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the beginning of the year)! After I was finished I thought for sure that was the grade I wanted to teach. Well, I was hired as a first grade teacher and spent one year there. At the end of the year I thought first grade was great! Then I was asked to move up to 2nd grade! Fast forward 4 years and I can confidently say, this is my favorite of the three so far! Compared to 1st grade the amount of independence these kids have is day and night. Coming from 3rd grade you may not think so but trust me when I say the difference between 1st and 2nd grade is crazy. So if I had to make a recommendation I would say to loon for a 2nd grade position. If you aren‚Äôt able to find a 2nd grade job I don‚Äôt think you would be disappointed in kinder or first either though!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Your vote of confidence is much appreciated.  But I'll wait for congratulations until it works in the classroom.  Haha.  

BTW, do you agree that class quizzes (which call upon volunteers from the class room on a one-by-one basis) and Bingo are not really examples of ""Active Learning""?"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you for your words. It calms me a bit to know it gets better.
ElementaryTeachers,thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,You‚Äôre doing a great job just because you are interested in your students actively learning. Keep learning and inspiring minds! Thank you for all you do to positively change lives.
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you for your reply.  I've read of the four Cs before.

Also, from what I've interpreted in the content of your reply, neither Quizzes (in the framework as I described above) nor Bingo are stellar examples of Active Learning activities."
ElementaryTeachers,"AdvancED quantifies active learning based on four indicators that can be observed in the classroom. 1. Learners dialogues/discussions/exchanges with each other and teacher predominate, 2. Learners make connections from content to real-life experiences, 3. Learners are actually engaged in learning activity, 4. Learners collaborate with their peers to accomplish/complete projects, activities, tasks, and/or assignments. 

Active learning is more about the collaboration and engagement students take in the learning and less of the activity. 

I would suggest framing your thinking around the four C‚Äôs when you are looking at incorporating active learning (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity). 

Hope this helps."
ElementaryTeachers,"You don't need a degree in education. NYS has a few alternative methods to get your license. 

Here's a link that might be helpful: [NYSED Teacher Pathways](http://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/certificate/rightpathway.html#two)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Idk how far into the year you are but I taught virtually all last year, and it does get better.
Something important to me was spending time online with them that wasn't instructional because you lose all those transitional get-to-know-you moments you get in person. So we would get on to play silly racing games and stuff they liked together for recess.

You will get to know them better and have fun. You will even maybe have a handful who do their best learning yet online. Try to enjoy having a year off from managing blurters, lines, and bathroom breaks. Enjoy seeing their faces since you aren't in person and masked.
It is a challenging time and so many people are experiencing trauma. Know you are these kids' connection to the outside world. I hope it gets better for you."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hated schools, but it had the merit of..
.finishing my scolarity, by ending up on a failed diploma (no occasio  to repass, neither to continue) on zoom, and ending up up employed.....
And my job it was.....teleworking, which had a short learning sessionw in an in-company school....

We had the options of coming...i'd come to avoid the bad home ambiance...3 would come too....it was nice to get to know, but we would see often only 6 weeks, then it was rhe dispatch."
ElementaryTeachers,"I loved my teachers, someone from a ""low-ish"" which comprised low income some well."
ElementaryTeachers,Dm me I could send you some of my lesson plans!
ElementaryTeachers,"There are some wonderful ones, but not all are free and will require a subscription"
ElementaryTeachers,"when I went to school units and rods meant something entirely different

HEY OH"
ElementaryTeachers,"When I taught third grade I did this with larger numbers, but you can do it for two-digit.

I have every kid 10 index cards. On one side, they wrote a digit (so 0 - 9, on on each card). On the other side, they wrote a 0.

Then I asked them to make a number using the cards. To find the value of a digit, they flipped over every card that isn't that digit and they can see the new number.

So 37

What is the value of the 3? Flip over every card that isn't the 3 and see the value. You flip the 7 to see the 0 on the other side. 30.

If you ask for the value if the 7, when they flip the 3 they have 07, so they can see the value.

After I did this, I would make a place value chart and they would write the zeros underneath instead of flipping cards."
ElementaryTeachers,"Physical props to show carry over and replacement can be really helpful. Mainly just understanding stuff like 
9 ones + 7 ones = 16 ones but only one digit can occupy that space so we can say that 16 ones is the same as 1 ten (showing the physical stack being replaced by the 10 I find helps) and 6 ones to give only one digit in each place"
ElementaryTeachers,Show BrainPop Jr. Videos
ElementaryTeachers,The link does not work for me.
ElementaryTeachers,Awesome!! Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Learn zillion is a website. iirc it is free with sign up
ElementaryTeachers,units and rods might be good for in the meantime. It's hard to predict when anything will come in anymore these days. I've not heard of learn zillion. Is that a book or a website? Number talks sounds familiar. I'll check them out. Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Didax.com has free virtual manipulatives!
ElementaryTeachers,"For sure manipulatives. You could print out units and rods while you wait, but it will take a bit of prep. Have you checked out learn zillion, or the book number talks? Those helped me when I taught first."
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,"Just an update, I did confirm that to teach mainstream elementary we only need pass the PPR and EC-6 content. It's also encouraged to take the ESL supplemental if you plan to work in any location that has a high bilingual population. Regardless, I think it's good to have!

Also, it is not required to be bilingual! At all. Texas in no way requires it for teachers (aside for the bilingual route I believe, which makes sense), it's really just a valley preference.

In fact, the bilingual supplement and BTLPT is only required if you plan to teach in spanish and english. 
I've heard the btlpt is challenging for fluent speakers, and myself not being that great I chose to just do the mainstream route vs bilingual. If your spanish is good, I would totally encourage you take both! ü§ó If you're interested I found a fb page that helps with the btlpt..I can add it here for you. The members are nice and share a lot of good tips for studying the material. 

All-in-all, I feel relief I can still do my dream job with the grade levels I am most comfortable teaching üôÇ"
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm glad I became a teacher because I have some sort of job security and good retirement when the time comes.  I got a bachelors in Anthropology 15 years ago and then worked in restaurants 'til I was almost 30. I'm finishing up my 7th year teaching, and am glad I took the risk on pursuing it as a career. I didn't even get an additional degree at first, just a teaching license for PreK-6. Anyway, I say get the BA in Elementary Ed if hanging with the little kids is fun for you--but also know that life is long and you can change careers as you go. Teaching can be emotionally taxing but it's very rewarding to know you're making a difference."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes that totally makes sense! Thank you!

I'm unsure if it's just my region in south texas (RGV) but I heard that I needed the bilingual cert and just found out theres another test, BTLPT (for spanish). I'm assuming that other test is because theres a majority of spanish speaking students here. However I dont know if that itself is a requirement or if the bilingual cert is enough.

So then the ESL cert is also for elementary?"
ElementaryTeachers,"I have always been told you do NOT have to be bilingual to teach / be certified bilingual. For example, I‚Äôm bilingual BUT my second language isn‚Äôt Spanish so yes I‚Äôm a bilingual person who could get a cert in bilingual education but my second language isn‚Äôt super common in most areas of a Texas. 

I don‚Äôt know if that helped at all. üôà

There is a big difference between the ESL cert and bilingual one though. We had a teacher who was bilingual and had the bilingual cert but didn‚Äôt have the ESL one (it wasn‚Äôt mandatory at the time) and she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have ESL kids. She had much smaller classroom sizes than the rest of the team (she had 18 and we were all pushing 22-24) but the years following our admin required all teachers to obtain the Esl cert."
ElementaryTeachers,"No kidding! I'm from the same area! 

I'm not fluent either. I can understand to some extent but to hold a conversation, I couldn't. 

It's interesting that they would go further up north and pass. You'd think the tests would be the same. 
I had heard there were some schools here that weren't strict about the certifications, but I'm assuming because those teachers are probably fluent in both languages so it's not as big a deal, per say."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm from south Texas (Hidalgo, TX to be exact) so literally right next to the border. I‚Äôve heard from some elementary teachers (who are now bilingual certified) took the tests in the upper cities (Houston, Dallas etc) because it seems that the tests administered down here in the valley are harder just for the fact that we are known for having a strong Spanish speaking background although personally I don‚Äôt consider myself extremely fluent in Spanish."
ElementaryTeachers,"That's good to know! Honestly my biggest worry is that I HAVE to be bilingual. I skimmed through the bilingual study booklet and it didnt seem too difficult. 

However, I just heard about the BTLPT from a family friend and she stated she did have to do written, oral, etc. in english and spanish. Also that in [some] interviews you may have to be able to prove you're capable of spanish speaking.

From my understanding the bilingual and BTLPT certification is required for elementary, and ESL for secondary. Though I have seen on some applications that ESL is a requirement for only some subjects, such as ELA."
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm in the exact same situation. I'm taking my EC-6 Core next month on the 15 and assuming I pass, I will start applying to jobs. I will, however, begin studying for the two bilingual tests that are required for the bilingual certification. While doing that, I'll just list it on my resume that my bilingual certification is pending and list it as: Bilingual certification (anticipated 2020-2021) that way the school districts I apply for know that I'm working on obtaining it. 

AND YES, I've also heard that many school districts are now wanting teachers to be bilingual or ESL certified but I don't know if IT IS a requirement. I know of a few elementary teachers that have had a hard time passing these two tests and have not lost their jobs til this day.  

I would totally go for it though. It will make your application stand out and they'll probably hire without questioning you too much in an interview. 

I haven't looked at the material on the bilingual supplemental nor the BTLPT because I have been studying and only focusing on my core subjects exam! 

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck! If you have a heart for teaching, then I'm sure you'll excel in whatever you want to be :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"I was enrolled there but my fianc√© did some research on the school and it said it was no longer accredited, but it could be wrong! I might try to give them another shot"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm just starting at WGU and I really like what I‚Äôve seen so far. I‚Äôm getting my masters but they do offer bachelors degrees as well!
ElementaryTeachers,DM me! I‚Äôm happy to share. I‚Äôm definitely figuring it out as I go (as we all are I guess haha)
ElementaryTeachers,"I be interested in the details of your plan, I also teach elementary art. My district has offered full time in person, and full time on line. However, large districts in my state are announcing fully online first marking periods. I am wondering if they will change it up."
ElementaryTeachers,"Our school board only just voted yesterday afternoon to go 100% virtual for the first quarter (I‚Äôm an elementary art teacher). I‚Äôm very interested to see how things play out. I had a pretty strong feeling this was going to happen so I drafted an action plan for resource (art/music/PE) to record videos and teach asynchronously and sent it to my admins a few days ago, to get ahead of the inevitable chaos when the decision was made.

I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôre going to give us very clear guidelines and support as we do this. During the closure (mid-March to June) here, it was super unclear what was expected, how we could do things, etc. 

I‚Äôm a new teacher, started mid-Feb, literally a month before school closed, so I‚Äôve been sweating bullets.
(edited bc hit send too soon)"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you so much this was also very helpful :) Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to get into my preferred credential program!
ElementaryTeachers,"First you need to decide on which program you want to go through. I would say the best options are the nearest CSU or CalStateTeach. If you want to go in person do a CSU. If you prefer online go CalStateTeach.
Then study and take your CBEST, and Multiple Subject CSETs. You will most likely need this in order to apply for the credential program.
Once you‚Äôre in the program it will be 3 semesters long and you‚Äôll follow their courses. Let me know if you have any questions!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you so much this was very helpful! 


I‚Äôm a little bit worried about getting accepted to a program because I didn‚Äôt do that well in college :( 


I, too, am unsure about the pandemic, but I just wanted to get my ducks in a row, like getting some money saved up, studying for any entry tests, and just getting my foot in the door, before I really buckle down and start everything. 


Thank you again!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Coincidentally, I have a biology degree and teach elementary! 

Not sure how much it's changed since I got my multi-subject credential (aka elementary) 21 years ago, but the typical route is to get accepted to a credentialing program, usually through a university - I went through San Francisco State University. It can last anywhere from 1-2 years depending on the pace of the program. They're not difficult to get into but it does cost significant money for tuition and you'll be a full time student so it's tough to work a regular job simultaneously. There are various academic theory tests you must pass plus student teaching before getting your credential. Keep in mind that despite all the credential classes and student teaching, you will NOT be prepared for the rigor, chaos, and insanity of being a teacher - not even close!

In rare cases, you can find an internship and teach your own class while doing your credential classes at night which is NOT easy and is absolutely exhausting as you might imagine. You would teach all day then go to classes until late at night. With this route, at least you get paid while earning your credential although it's very low pay on an auxiliary pay scale lower than a first year teacher. 

If you haven't already done so, I would STRONGLY getting your feet wet by substitute teaching first. While it's nowhere close to being an actual full time elementary teacher, it will give at least a small taste of what the job entails. It's also a good way to get your ""feet in the door"" of districts that you may want to work for in the future. 

With the pandemic, getting a credential right now is a huge unknown. I don't know how you could possibly get experience working in classrooms right now so you'd have to talk to the credential program leaders. 

Good luck!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Look up the licensing guidelines for your area. In the states, different states have different requirements and levels of teaching degrees. For example, in some states, you can get a provisional license with a bachelors degree and job offer from a school."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, I am about to start my sixth year, I'm going to do my best answering these questions.

* Can you pick what grade you teach?
   * Not often, but administration does try to accommodate with what you're comfortable with because you'll do a better job there. When you are student teaching, some programs let you request a grade level.  Whatever grade you spend the most time working with can show your preference and can help placement between guide upper or lower grades when looking for a job.
* How do you know what type of curriculum you must teach? Is there anything you are given that helps you teach the lesson?
   * The state or school system will provide the curriculum and often has a ton of resources.  I work for a bigger county, and there is a TON of support.  Making friends with coworkers is huge; it is certainly a team effort when someone is in their first year.  Everyone feels like they are floundering, but you're not.  You'll get it and be amazing! Tip: When going on interview, as principals if they have a mentoring/new teacher committee.
* Whats the best way to plan activities/lessons?
   * That's a bit of a broad question. Be sure that your lessons completely align to the standard being taught.  I realized after two years that I had not understood the standards to the degree necessary to teach.  Look at the standards, map out a schedule, create the unit test, and teach with the end goal in mind. \*Don't teach the test, but teach the curriculum thoroughly.
* Are there other things I should do before applying for any teaching position that would help?
   * Jump into your student teaching with the mindset of being hands-on.  I was shy the first year of mine, and I feel like I missed out on a lot of learning opportunities.
* How do you find out about open teaching positions?
   * Go to the county or school systems websites and fill out applications.  Also, drop off resumes to the schools you really want to work at in person. It's okay to talk to people you know in the system.
* What is the interview process like?
   * It depends on the school.  They'll call you in and there is usually some administration and possibly some teachers.
* What if I have to call out of work for an emergency or that I‚Äôm sick? What do I or the school do?
   * The school will go over all this information at new teacher orientation at the county and school."
ElementaryTeachers,No I just wanted to check out plenty of options and compare costs.
ElementaryTeachers,I know of online schools but within my state of Texas. Are you looking for in-state?
ElementaryTeachers,Not a game- but Epic! Books is a virtual library! There‚Äôs a lot you can do with it academically and my students asked every day if they were getting on.
ElementaryTeachers,"Just my 2 cents:

* When you do get an interview, I would suggest researching the school &amp; district history, student and family demographics for the school/district, and the district's educational philosophy in the days before the interview. It would also be helpful to know what reading/writing and math programs are used in the district and learn a bit about them before the interview if you're not already familiar.
* I've been on multiple interview committees over the past 20 years and they've been held in various ways. Sometimes, it's a large group of principals and teachers in a large conference room at the district office. Other times it's just been at the school site in a  small meeting room with just the principal and a few teachers. They will often ask you various questions from what makes an effective reading program to different behavioral scenarios and how you would handle them. There's usually between 10-15 questions. We've always end with ""Do you have any questions?"" so be prepared to ask questions as this part often tells more about a candidate than any of the other questions.
* Right now it's a bit difficult with school closings but substituting is a great way to get to know a school and district as well as get your ""foot in the door"". My school has hired many good teachers that were former subs that built a good reputation. The saying ""It's not what you know but who you know."" holds true, at least in my experience in my district."
ElementaryTeachers,"- you will he hired for a specific grade level not just generally by the school so ideally you can ‚Äúpick‚Äù the grade by applying to positions that you want. 
- Most schools have a curriculum for at least reading and math and they are different all over the Country but whatever curriculum it is, you follow basically what the books tells you to do. Most curriculums have extra supplies, workbooks, homework sheet, etc.
- you can‚Äôt plan anything until you know what curriculum you would be using but joining Facebook groups, following teachers on insta, and looking on Teacherspayteacher.com is extremely helpful to find fun ways to teach your lessons. 
- For applying you‚Äôll need you‚Äôre resume and cover letter for each school you apply to. The cover letter should talk about the schools mission or anything that they represent, while also selling yourself. That means you have to change the cover letter a bit for each school. Make sure you do basic research on the school‚Äôs website in case they ask you anything about it. 
- I use Applitrack.com, not sure how popular it is in CA but usually you can type in ‚Äú(school district #) applitrack and you can fill out an application. This website it cool bc it will autofill your info if you apply to more than one school on applitrack. 
- interviewing is different everywhere, sometimes it‚Äôs just questions, sometimes they will want you to teach a lesson in front of them or something like that so it depends on school district. 
- each school is different about subs. I formed relationships with a few so that I was able to text them if I needed someone last minute but usually you just call in and they will assign a sub or there is usually a website to just input that you arw sick and it looks for subs in the district. You make easy lesson plans for the sub to follow. All you‚Äôre doing is losing one of your sick days. You‚Äôll have a set amount of paid sick days

ElementaryTeachers,"Not at first. I‚Äôm currently in the process of looking for a position and it‚Äôs whatever‚Äôs available at the moment. I use edjoin.com for positions. Also, look at the district websites.

Interview is basic questions about your teaching style, examples of activities you‚Äôd did, and they ask about specific scenarios."

ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôll hang out in this thread as I have the same goal (either counseling or social work).
ElementaryTeachers,"In our district, we have non licensed folks called ‚Äúcommunity school outreach coordinator.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need your license for this job as it is considered a ‚Äúclassified‚Äù job. Basically they work in the schools to identify the needs of the students and then reach out to the community for support. Mostly in title 1 schools and most like people who are bilingual in the languages of the community."
ElementaryTeachers,Nathan Hale‚Äôs Hazardous Tales
ElementaryTeachers,"Many got in the door early on Teachers Pay Teachers, and they make enough money through the products they post that their income allows them to leave their classroom. Instagram is such a great resource for ideas and classroom activities. It‚Äôs harder now to build up a following like those teachers did, and there‚Äôs a lot more competition for activities on Teachers Pay Teachers."
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I agree. Seems lame. I want advice and encouragement from those still in the trenches so to speak."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you. I'll remember thatüôÇ. Looks like I have taught my poor students completely wrong üôÅ.
ElementaryTeachers,"Your model is inaccurate. Fractions represent equal sized parts. Your parts are not equal. To draw sixths with an circular model, draw an X with a horizontal or vertical line going through its vertex."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôve been thinking about doing a ‚Äúspotify theme‚Äù, basically just black and green with a ‚Äúclass playlist‚Äù, a bulletin board for ‚Äútop of the charts‚Äù great work, things like that. It‚Äôs easy to find music themed classroom stuff, and basically at that point you‚Äôre just working off of some colors. You can also make name tags with artist tags, all things that would be free with a bit of clever computer work and printing"
ElementaryTeachers,"I did this with ""respect"". Everything always came back to our classroom motto: Respect - show it, earn it."
ElementaryTeachers,"I've worked in education for a long time and that sounds weird.  This sub is full of posts about admin overreach, it's really strange, but also, I guess it's cool that admin cares enough to overdo it? That said, as a first year teacher, I would want to focus on science. I want to blow some minds, make all my kids feel like astronauts for NASA, or be more innovative with SpaceX stuff. I'd call them my classtronauts, lol"
ElementaryTeachers,"Congratulations! A free resource that can help your fifth graders is [Dreamscape](https://playdreamscape.com), a FREE reading reading game that is perfect for students in grades 2-8 and helps improve reading skills.In order to move time within the game, you have to read a passage and answer questions. Our game has been proven to help with standardized tests as well.There are dashboard features built on the website that are perfect to monitor student progress. The game can be played on PC or iPad.

Good luck with your transition!"
ElementaryTeachers,"Be prepared if you don't get hired right away. In 2004, I got married and moved 800 miles away from my hometown. I started substituting in 2006.Then decided to go back to school in 2008. I graduated in 2010. I continued to sub and could not land interviews. It was depressing. So, 2015,I had my son. He started Kindergarten this year, but I kept him virtual. Well, I decided to apply in the district in hopes that I could get interviews for his school. Well, I'm now going to be teaching 3rd grade summer school AND 4th grade for the 2021-2022 school year! I'm ecstatic!!!! So, nowi can really tell kids that you don't always have to give up your dreams, they may just be put on a back burner for awhile."
ElementaryTeachers,"Go to Schoolgirl Style (Google it). She‚Äôs got tons of themes on her website. Never heard of a principal asking or even caring, though. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to have a Pinterest-worthy classroom. It takes years and a lot of paychecks to build up a supply  of things to really give your room a theme. See what‚Äôs been left-behind in your classroom also.  There are also a lot of classroom decor ideas on Teachers Pay Teachers, with downloadable, printable stuff for free or just a few dollars. Speaking of dollars, Dollar Tree is a great place to start! Great classroom storage and even bulletin board stuff. The Target Dollar Spot puts out great Back to School classroom items around July."
ElementaryTeachers,"I always have something very generic like rainbow, which really just means I print and laminate a lot of stuff in color using school resources.

But, for real, themed stuff costs big money. If your principal wants a theme, I would suggest asking about the budget for themed items. 

If you need a cheap, overall mindset then ""Growth Mindset"" is a good one since there are tons of free printables out there."
ElementaryTeachers,"Here‚Äôs the thing: the classroom is the students‚Äô learning space, not just staff workspace. If you absolutely have to do a theme, pick one based on what you want to teach your students about (social emotional skills, character traits.) Then, have them decorate the space over the course of the year."
ElementaryTeachers,Maybe something like this? https://www.teachercreated.com/classroom-decorations/travel-the-map.php
ElementaryTeachers,"Theme: ""For the sake of humanity, don't force teachers to have a theme."""
ElementaryTeachers,"Make sure that if they are super focused on that theme, that they reimburse you for buying all the decorations."
ElementaryTeachers,"Your principal is reaching out to you about themes?

I have never heard of this!!"
ElementaryTeachers,"To be honest, every conference I've been to about classroom design has said not to use themes. 

How about something like kindness?"
ElementaryTeachers,Haha that‚Äôs actually amazing!
ElementaryTeachers,You should get together with that [5th grade teacher switching to 1st grade](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElementaryTeachers/comments/ni9leu/advice_for_a_first_year_1st_grade_teacher/) and mail each other all your teaching materials lol.
ElementaryTeachers,"I am just finishing up my 1st year as a 1st grade teacher! I was expecting to teach upper el as well so it was a big adjustment. 

The biggest thing I‚Äôve noticed is that 1st grade is a huge jump from Kindergarten in expectations and so it‚Äôs a big adjustment. I only taught Math, Science, and Social Studies so I can‚Äôt speak to ELA. For math there will likely be a large range of students. I have students who couldn‚Äôt count to 25 all the way up to students who could do basic double digit addition. The biggest thing is to build their basic number sense as a lot of students don‚Äôt really understand numbers. I also got a lot of pressure to teach concepts like multiplication and division to ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù their students. Some parents don‚Äôt understand that there is an appropriate sequence and that their 6 year old isn‚Äôt ready for multiplication just because they have memorized some multiplication facts. 

1st grade was a lot of fun (I‚Äôm moving up to 5th next year) so I hope you enjoy it!"
ElementaryTeachers,This was very helpful! Thank you so much!
ElementaryTeachers,You can look at the state common core curriculum on your state's Department of Public Instruction website. They have a variety of instructional resources
ElementaryTeachers,"**Assess early and often and make referrals as needed for suspected learning or mental health disabilities - ask for support if you need it on spotting them. If they're not caught by grade 2 the damage to self esteem can be irreparable.**

You will be doing a whole lot of literacy, which should ideally following a solid multisensory phonics-based approach with small group reading instruction built in in levelled grouos. You can support with sight words. Activities need to be kept short, light, and focused with lots of play built in and loads of repetition of the concept. You will likely use a levelled reading system but try not to focus overmuch on levels. Try to use decodable texts as much as possible. Read-alouds, think-alouds, modelled and shared writing, as well as independent reading and writing time are all important. You want to have a good balance. Keep an eye out for students who are having a hard time segmenting words into sounds and use a lot of visuals to support.

You will spend most of the rest of the instructional time on maths. Again, lots of repetition, lots of physical manipulatives, lots of play-based learning if you can, and try to look into open-ended maths tasks with low floors and high ceilings. Number talks are great for this. If your school supports it, I would recommend trying to incorporate guided or small-group maths as well with levelled groups. Doubles and skip counting through games are great too. 

Start to give them choice as much as possible. 

You'll need a solid solid solid daily routine (I like to start with morning meeting and calendar to drive home a literacy and maths approach, songs and poems, and a daily SEL focus. The Mojo videos are like 2-3 minutes long and the kids love them!) 

Then you'll shoehorn in art, music, and PE, depending on how your specials break down. You might get a little science or social studies but really, you'll have to use maths or literacy to get most of that in. 

Your big thing is ROUTINES. Expect to spend a week teaching them routines at the beginning of the year. Don't even bother with academics much. The kids need to know where to sit, where to put their things, how to sit, how to go to the bathroom, when is snack, how to wait, where to get pencils, how to transition, how to quiet down, how to ask for help, how to be independent in these routines, and how to walk in a damn line. (They will not do this.) I'm serious - we practiced at least 2x a week, and I teach grade 2! Kids love incentives - fill a jar with pompoms for a choice activity, or do a chart indicating growth and give stickers. I also do laminated paper strips for rewards - get ten and you can trade them in for sitting with a buddy during snack, or save to 20 to trade for a small prize. Save 50 for a big prize. Etc.

Expect to reteach these routines CONSTANTLY through the year. After each break. Daily. Be gentle and kind but firm. 

Additional things to watch for this year and embed into the beginning: fine motor and pencil grasp. Video your kids' hands and really look at their grasp. For students with poor FM skills try to refer or remediate as much as possible early on. If you have an OT on staff or available have them set up some activities for the kids to do in down time or incorporate them into guided groups.

Gross motor: use movement activities to strengthen midline crossing and core strength. Go Noodles are great. Body breaks are the best. Alternative seating is the bomb. 

Finally, always end the day on a good note. Story time, telling (bad) jokes, an award or praise once everyone is organized is such a great way to finish up the day. 

For you, borrowing and tweaking routines from a teacher with experience will work best. 

Send a positive note home or call home to every single student in the first week. For classroom management, positive praise works best. Call out good behaviours every time you see them. 

Have fun! Grade 1s are still basically little walking egos who want to share their excitement with everyone and who start to really blossom with empathy and awareness as the year goes on."
ElementaryTeachers,"Get some games under your belt, classroom management is key, my principal told me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt work for free, neither will they‚Äù she told me to bribe them with candy, being concerned with unhealthy rewards I bribed them with technology and stickers instead. Classroom jobs was always helpful as well. Always smile. Don‚Äôt have corners in your room where you can‚Äôt see them."
ElementaryTeachers,"First graders should be very well-versed in phonological awareness, phonics, sight words, and concepts of print to have a strong foundation for reading. Look up state standards for math. I agree that the SEL component is very important as a means to bridge the gap of learning loss."
ElementaryTeachers,"Ask the district what curricula they are having you use and if you can look at it over the summer. I hate ever letting anyone know I do anything over summer that‚Äôs work related, but it‚Äôs nice to get a sense of the scope and sequence before being thrown in. It also helps me meet the unhealthy expectations I put on myself as an educator. First grade is a lot of reading instruction, writing instruction, and working on math skills. I‚Äôd be curious if you have a dedicated phonics block or SEL time. Depending on where you‚Äôre at, you might want to also look at any kindergarten skills that were skipped due to distance learning, especially social emotional skills."
ElementaryTeachers,"It really depends on where you work. Some schools and districts, and states, are great places to teach, with supportive administration and good compensation/benefits, and others are a nightmare. If you go into education, remember that you are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you. Do research and get as much information as you can about the school and district from people who work there before committing to anything."
ElementaryTeachers,I know the feeling. My own mother has said to me that I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äúreal teacher‚Äù now that I teach elementary and not preschool. Makes me so mad!!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm not sure if you were an educator or not. But if so, I really hope you choose another profession."
ElementaryTeachers,I used to teach elementary school and now I‚Äôm a software engineer. Fuck anyone who thinks elementary teachers are dumb.
ElementaryTeachers,I could teach highschoolers if I wanted. I don‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt like older kids as much as I do younger ones.
ElementaryTeachers,"There are  a lot more pointless meetings than I expected. There's almost no time to plan or get ready for the next thing or breathe or eat or go to the bathroom.  After kids get on the buses, you can bet money you'll need to wait your turn to use the bathroom because everybody's been holding it all day. Yes, the kids are great, but there are so many added stressors that unfortunately it can sometimes be hard to enjoy them. I'm in year 8 and thinking about changing paths. The retirement benefits (in Virginia) are amazing but I don't know if I can do 22 more years."
ElementaryTeachers,"OP is right. I have also heard elementary teachers talk about themselves like this, unfortunately."
ElementaryTeachers,Yes! I have a doctorate in education and I teach elementary makerspace. I used to teach high school English. I tell people I was finally promoted to the important work.
ElementaryTeachers,"It is hard but it‚Äôs so rewarding. And there‚Äôs no community like a teacher community. It‚Äôs amazing! Every school has a different climate, and even if it‚Äôs not great school wide, YOU get to set the climate inside your classroom. Teachers usually feel ‚Äúcalled‚Äù to the job. It‚Äôs a job of passion and service. Follow your heart - it‚Äôll lead you to your purpose."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you're currently poor, you'll stay poor, but kinda feel good about yourself, until you're sick of being poor, and then you can't escape, and by year ten you're ready to quit, but you just quit on the kids instead because it's easier that way and the parents don't care anyways, so why not just kick back and get that check. So...yeah...."
ElementaryTeachers,"I think it strongly depends on where you work and your own life goals. 

For me, it's not worth it. I adore working with my students but everything else is a nightmare. The hours, work-life balance, terrible pay, lack of professionalism, lack of respect, poor career advancement options, etc. If I could actually focus on teaching my students, had quality resources, and plan time that was worthwhile, I would likely not be leaving. Conditions are better in other states/areas but it's such a gamble."
ElementaryTeachers,"It hugely depends on where you live and work. I had a really really hard experience in one state, moved to an adjacent state and it's a dream."
ElementaryTeachers,"I currently a third grade teacher and yeah it‚Äôs tough but I love it. There are many demands and you sometimes feel pulled in many different directions. You do wear many hats and fill out lots of paperwork (most of it useless). You have to sit through various trainings and meetings. You build relationships with students and sometimes see pretty heartbreaking things. But you also see some amazing things, like seeing that spark in a child‚Äôs eye when they finally just get it and you helped them get there. And this is all after you graduate. That‚Äôs a lot of work itself. My mom also tried to tell me it was a tough industry and a couple of her friends told me a few horror stories. I still wanted to do it. 

When I was placed in a ‚Äúrough‚Äù neighborhood for student teaching I still loved it and wanted to do it. When I couldn‚Äôt find a full time teaching position after three different positions as a maternity replacement teacher I still loved it and wanted to do it. When I moved and couldn‚Äôt find a teaching position and had to accept an assistant position just to stay in the classroom I still loved it and wanted to do it. When I broke up three fights in less than six months I still loved it and wanted to do it. When I had to complete switch gears and teach 100% virtual and student engagement was way down I still loved it and wanted to do it. 

I‚Äôve been teaching for over five years now and I still love interacting with the kids as much as I did when I first started teaching preschoolers in high school. If you love it, do it! You won‚Äôt regret it- at least I don‚Äôt.

ElementaryTeachers,"I started the survey, but then realized it was for US teachers. If you want to add other countries, I'd be happy to contribute my experience in Ontario."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you! Our aim was to give space for teachers to have a voice.
ElementaryTeachers,I did as well. This is my topic for my dissertation as well.
ElementaryTeachers,I took the survey. It was nice to have a space to vent about the last year and the unique pressures we faced.

ElementaryTeachers,What pants do you wear with your teacher t shirts? I‚Äôm in Florida‚Ä¶ :(
ElementaryTeachers,"Is this something being sold? Something publicly accessible? (Sorry, I'm new to this thread)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Me too, but that was 17 years ago. Not sure how easy it is now"
ElementaryTeachers,"Graduate level teaching preparation courses. I have my BA in psych, did 12 credits in a grad program, started teaching, and then went back to the same school to complete a master's in education. Luckily they applied my 12 credits towards my masters so pretty sweet deal."
ElementaryTeachers,"I also got a B.A. in Psychology (and German) originally. I also got an M.A. that was unrelated to teaching and worked for a number of years in other jobs. Eventually, I realized I wanted to teach, so I applied to a master‚Äôs program in elementary ed. Mine was a one year professional development school program, meaning we had a partnership with certain schools in a nearby school district. Through that program, I was able to get my license, and I am now about to start my second year as a first grade teacher. (I live in the U.S.) I will say most M. Ed. programs are 2 years I believe. The one I got into is not the norm."
ElementaryTeachers,"Depends where you live. I'm in Canada and I have a BA in Psyc and where I live, I was just able to use that to get into a teaching program. :)"
ElementaryTeachers,"Check out alt routes to certification.  The program I used serves a handful of states: [https://www.teachersoftomorrow.org/alternate-teacher-certification](https://www.teachersoftomorrow.org/alternate-teacher-certification)

but you can find programs at colleges near you.  Just be warned if you try program I used, their customer service and advising takes forever, so give yourself lots of time.  If you start now, you could teach in the spring."
ElementaryTeachers,Alternative certification! Theres lots of programs
ElementaryTeachers,Get some rest because you have to do it all again tomorrow!
ElementaryTeachers,ME TOO! Not to mention car line took an hour and it was 91 degrees
ElementaryTeachers,We believe in you! Sending you strength!
ElementaryTeachers,"remove.bg is great‚Ä¶ they have a sister site called unsceen.com that can mask out backgrounds for short videos.

ElementaryTeachers,Why?
ElementaryTeachers,Thanks! This is great.
ElementaryTeachers,Don‚Äôt.
ElementaryTeachers,"During my internship, long-term sub position, year one, and year two, I was sick what felt like every month (although mildly). I did not get sick once last year. I was very much masked and very much sanitized."
ElementaryTeachers,"I was incredibly healthy! The constant sniffles, occasional cough, and tiredness fixed itself by staying home. 
I did full in-person summer school recently. Sniffles are back."
ElementaryTeachers,"100% less sick. I usually get strep at least once a year, to the point where the doc said maybe we should remove my tonsils, along with miscellaneous other colds/viruses/flus. Last year‚Ä¶nothing!


And then, the second I stopped wearing my mask bc of summer break/the mandate ended, what happened? I got a cold that lasted like 10 days."
ElementaryTeachers,6 feet is the length of approximately 3.66 'Logitech Wireless Keyboard K350s' laid widthwise by each other
ElementaryTeachers,Our school district had many options for students last year. We still had in person classes. I was less sick last year than previously with I think 1 sick day call out. Students and were required to wear masks when they couldn't maintain 6 feet of social distance. This year there is no mask mandate but I plan to wear a mask when I am within 6 feet again.
ElementaryTeachers,"6 feet is the length of exactly 17.96 'Standard Diatonic Key of C, Blues Silver grey Harmonicas' lined up next to each other"
ElementaryTeachers,"I definitely got less sick! And I didn‚Äôt have a single student out due to the classic cold/flu. They were only out if they were a close contact for covid and had to quarantine.

We were in-person 4 days/week (1 virtual day), sat 6 feet apart, and were always masked except when students ate lunch at their desks."
ElementaryTeachers,Many thank you's :)
ElementaryTeachers,Done!
ElementaryTeachers,"Thank you! I will definitely be looking into it more. As someone who works full time, the ability to have a self paced school sounds wonderful"
ElementaryTeachers,"I came here to recommend WGU as well. I have a year left in my term and I've had a positive experience overall. The term rate was recently raised, however, so now it's around 3700 for a term.

Edited to add my age: I will be 31 this year."
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you and congratulations!! üòá
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm going into my final practicum this year, I‚Äôm 22 right now so I‚Äôll be 23 by the time I start my career. That being said I‚Äôm by far the youngest person in my year. The majority of people in my classes are around 30 years old, so I would say go for it! 
 Definitely not too late üòä."
ElementaryTeachers,Roger that! Subscribe to my youtube channel to be alerted once I complete it.
ElementaryTeachers,Wonderful information thank you so much!!
ElementaryTeachers,"- Is it too late? - No, absolutely not. I started my first year teaching at 27 after taking a break to start my family. 

- Can you start at Community and Transfer? - Yes, absolutely. You should be able to transfer (and hopefully many of your existing credits will transfer) and complete your degree in a total of 4 or fewer years. 

I would also STRONGLY recommend WGU, which is an online college. It's the one I personally graduated from. It's completely self-paced and it's easy to accelerate your degree if you put the work into it. You pay by semester (6 month term) at a flat rate and get credit for as many courses as you complete. It's also only like 3k per semester, iirc. 

The best place to look to get started is usually your state education agency since they usually have a comprehensive list of accepted educators and the requirements to be licensed in your state."
ElementaryTeachers,Done :)
ElementaryTeachers,"Multiplication facts!

ElementaryTeachers,Third and fourth grade math teacher here!  This is awesome!  Thanks!
ElementaryTeachers,Have you ever been a part of either personalized or differentiated professional learning (based on your definitions)?
ElementaryTeachers,"Personalized and differentiated are very different. Personalized would mean learning paths. Most of the time when a teacher is taking part in personalized learning it is because they are on a professional growth plan. Differentiation is done three ways through process, product, and content. In most instances the amount of time available for teacher professional learning is so small direct instruction is the most effective delivery. You will find the differentiation in the follow up in how the process, product, or content is developed to put the professional learning into practice."
ElementaryTeachers,You MUST be patient and passionate to do this job!!
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm new to this, I‚Äôm struggling but I‚Äôm really trying. When they finally understand something or they say something that even you never thought about yourself, you feel so damn proud. If it‚Äôs younger kids, they are very very loving. There‚Äôs not a lot of money in it but if you‚Äôre looking to give children a beautiful start and you really want to commit to them you should do it. I don‚Äôt know how it works where you live but if you can get some experience before jumping into the profession try that out. In my country you have volunteer programs."
ElementaryTeachers,"I do love to teach and I think you‚Äôre absolutely right about volunteering. It will really help me in making a decision. Thank you to everyone who replied, I appreciate you!"
ElementaryTeachers,I agree! Canva helps make things so fun and lets them see a good side of you.
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely volunteer in a classroom. I think your idea is great. I do want say, I hear a lot of people saying the reason they want to teach is because they love kids. Which is obviously great. But you need to love the act of teaching. There are so many other jobs where you interact with kiddos, and honestly have more time to interact with them than a classroom teacher. 

So volunteer in a school, and if it is for you than go for it! Best career in the world."
ElementaryTeachers,Definitely the most rewarding job in the world.
ElementaryTeachers,"You aren't going to become rich in money if you become a teacher, but if you're doing it for the right reasons, that's not going to matter.  Your heart however, will be FULL.  I love my  job. It isn't making me rich, but being ""rich"" is not what is going to giving me a fulfilling life.

My job and family FULFILL me. That's more important than money any day."
ElementaryTeachers,"Lots of good stuff to think about, thanks!"
ElementaryTeachers,"That‚Äôs a great suggestion, thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I realize it's probably difficult during these Covid times, but volunteering in a classroom would be a great experience. Ask the teachers questions. Get their real opinions and experiences so you get a better picture of what it's like to be an elementary school teacher. 

Earning your teaching credential is both a time and monetary commitment so I'd hate for you to dedicate that and find out your first year that teaching is not for you."
ElementaryTeachers,"No one goes into teaching for the pay. That said, there are plenty of states that pay a livable salary. Obviously you will want to avoid the states that are known for abysmal pay. If you live in one of those states, you need to be open to relocating. Teaching is an incredibly rewarding job but you have to be really committed to it and ***passionate*** about it or you will quickly be burnt out. You need a growth mindset and be okay with constant PD, often self-administered rather than provided by your school. You need to be open to trying new things, always. I've worked with plenty of teachers who look at a method that is proven effective and say ""Well that's just not my style"".... that is not the right mindset to have in this career.

Also, if you want a homey and well-furnished classroom, you need to be willing to invest your own $$ if your school/district doesn't provide funding for that (most do not). I see tons of teachers complain about spending their money on their rooms but I mean, no one made them, and it's common knowledge -- we all go into this career ***knowing*** that funding usually isn't provided and that most teachers fund their own classrooms. If you're not cool with that, don't go into this career, or at least try to get into a district that DOES pay but be aware that, again, most don't."
ElementaryTeachers,"The only times I feel poor is when I want something for my classroom and realize ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt buy 25 of these!!‚Äù Sometimes I wonder if I got paid more, what that would mean for my students. 

Theater will definitely help. A lot of my teaching is working on emotional regulation and empathy (really working on recognizing how someone else is feeling.)

Yoga will help to - kids love doing yoga. We do it for stretching breaks frequently or as a buffer between snack/indoor recess and switching our brains and bodies back to learning. 

If you feel like it‚Äôs something you want to do, do it! There are also a lot of pathways to becoming a teacher (TFA) and licensing options so depending on where you are in your studies, it might be good to check those out."
ElementaryTeachers,"I turned off the DM option for students on Zoom this past school year. They could send messages to everyone or to me privately only. If we didn‚Äôt follow online etiquette or used the chat when we shouldn‚Äôt be, I would just turn off the chat feature. 

I know it‚Äôs not great, but I think your conversation on compassion and empathy will be enough. I‚Äôd follow up with parents. And maybe explain that because some of us haven‚Äôt met the expectations of using the chat, they can no longer send DMs during class."
ElementaryTeachers,"‚ÄúAre you following online etiquette?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhy am I receiving reports of mean messages?‚Äù
Let the student explain. Then definitely let parents in on the concern."
ElementaryTeachers,"TPT is Teachers Pay Teachers. It‚Äôs an absolutely WONDERFUL website with materials created by teachers for teachers. You can filter the products by grade level, subject, and price. Lots of stuff is free or minimally priced. You download and print the materials out. Lots of schools have an account and will pay for purchases, which are kept in a school ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù so other teachers can use them. Say I want to teach subtraction with regrouping to my second graders. I can scroll through probably around 60 different resources and select the one(s) I find most engaging and that best meet my students needs, purchase it and use it immediately. TPT has enhanced my curriculum in countless valuable ways. They also have an app. You should definitely check them out."
ElementaryTeachers,By genre without levels listed
ElementaryTeachers,Canva is great to make your own.
ElementaryTeachers,Agree with Clark‚Äôs. Nordstrom Rack and Zappos usually have nice prices.
ElementaryTeachers,"This will be my 3rd year teaching. Teaching is tough. More days are stressful than not &amp; in my city I would be unable to live comfortably without my husbands income. I make 35k a year with a bachelors degree and state licensure. I work in a private school that pays 12k less than public school salary for first year teachers, however I rather have less pay and have my spirit fed rather than stripped away (I live in a very popular city with a huge school district, kids are just a number and so are teachers) With that being said, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do anything else with my life. I love teaching. I love connecting with kids &amp; inspiring future leaders. I deal with a few mental health issues including anxiety and depression, I‚Äôve quit a teaching position mid year due to an extended depressive episode. I would not recommend teaching to someone with major anxiety issues. You will have to talk to parents and coworkers daily which sounds like it could be a trigger in your case. I would say focus on your mental health and find the root cause and maybe teaching could work for you!"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôve worked in schools with different dress codes. One did not allow sneakers. One did not allow jeans. Another one did not allow open toed shoes or flipflops.
ElementaryTeachers,"This word/phrase(tpt) has a few different meanings. You can see all of them by clicking the link below.

ElementaryTeachers,what is TPT?
ElementaryTeachers,Social anxiety and presentation anxiety will make being a teacher harder on you. Teaching is a very social occupation.
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm now entering my 5th year of classroom teaching and making 50k this school year. I started at 38k, and before that I was working at a nonprofit teaching in different schools every week for 25k. I won‚Äôt ever say that I‚Äôm still doing teaching because of the money, but on hard days, it‚Äôs a thought that crosses my mind. 

I usually work around 65 hours a week and it‚Äôs exhausting. Now that I‚Äôm in my 5th year, I think I will have a better handle on work-life balance, but also last year my role changed halfway through and I spent the entire school year teaching from home. I couldn‚Äôt even try to leave work at work. 

I tell friends ‚Äúmy dream job is a job where I sit at a desk - maybe in a cubicle - and answer phone calls, write emails, and occasionally clean out the microwave and then go home.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd suggest finding a administrative job for now - I‚Äôm sure your interviews have gone well - and then decide what you want to do. You could also apply for some paraprofessional jobs at schools - or even look to see about some administrative jobs at schools. After a year or two, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have a better idea of what you want. 

I think you should also try to reframe ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing what I‚Äôm meant to do‚Äù because that doesn‚Äôt seem healthy. Maybe what do you feel like you‚Äôre meant to do? Why? Then make it more general and see how you can still do that in other roles (at least for now.)"
ElementaryTeachers,Theyre expensive $130-$170 but so many people i know swear by ‚ÄúOn Clouds‚Äù and almost everrryone where i live has a pair
ElementaryTeachers,"I worked in a UK private school.... Rigid, pointless dress code.   I wear Clarks"
ElementaryTeachers,Theyre expensive but people swear by On Clouds
ElementaryTeachers,Vionic shoes are the best for teacher feet.
ElementaryTeachers,oooh i haven‚Äôt tried the cushy ones yet. that may be my next purchase
ElementaryTeachers,Allbirds
ElementaryTeachers,I bought the clarks slip on shoes amd they worked well! Also Dr. scholls sandals were super comfy
ElementaryTeachers,I love it! I am also 25 but going on 87 so I am always looking for comfy clothes! Nordstrom is having their anniversary sale so now is a good time to buy some work shoes from their too!
ElementaryTeachers,Check eBay! They have good deals sometimes too!
ElementaryTeachers,"Former waiter/bartender ‚Äî sounds crazy, but Crocs make a real comfortable clog that‚Äôs durable, easy to clean, and very comfortable.

They don‚Äôt look like Crocs, either, lol."
ElementaryTeachers,Yes they have the comfy cush ones!
ElementaryTeachers,They hold up super well! Even after putting them through the washing machine several times. I had mine for a few years. Good luck on your shoe hunt!
ElementaryTeachers,Why would you not be allowed to wear sneakers?
ElementaryTeachers,"Ive never heard of Everlane, but it has some cute stuff! And not too pricey, so they may be a good option :) thanks for the recommendation!"
ElementaryTeachers,No Off Broadway near me unfortunately. But I have been lusting over a pair of Steve Madden Beale Sneakers for awhile now haha I'm glad to hear they're comfy! Maybe I can finally justify buying a pair to myself üòÖ
ElementaryTeachers,"Omg. I never kept track, but 8000 steps sounds about right üòÖ I'm in a new district, so I'm not positive on dress code yet... but running shoes sound like heaven"
ElementaryTeachers,"Definitely pay for good socks!!  If you get romeos, remember they‚Äôll stretch a little over time. So get the right length, but don‚Äôt worry if they feel a little snug across the top. They‚Äôll stretch in. They last a long time too, and come in anti-skid."
ElementaryTeachers,"Ugh, those are SO cute. Just a little outside my price range right now üò© but definitely going on the wishlist. Thanks for the recommendation!"
ElementaryTeachers,Love a good pair of vans. They literally go with everything
ElementaryTeachers,"Ooooh, those aren't too pricey! Definitely could be a good Christmas present to myself haha 

And I just discovered the magic of supportive socks earlier this year! I had no idea those existed, but they're SO good"
ElementaryTeachers,Just faved so many pairs of Clark's on poshmark üòÖ  I was pleasantly surprised by their options!!
ElementaryTeachers,"Camping, hiking, biking, working out, even just taking a book and reading outside.  Just make sure  you take the time to relax, do things you want to do, and not think about work.  As much people mock teachers for having the summer off, it is needed to recharge so you don‚Äôt get burnt out (especially after the last year) and can give your best self to your students in the fall."
ElementaryTeachers,"My husband and I made a summer fun list so we have been going through that :) I was sad summer was almost over and my husband said ‚Äúwell it just means we should make a fall frolic list‚Äù lol 

I have things like, going to the park, swimming in the lake, spending time with family, watching a certain movie, at home spa day, etc."
ElementaryTeachers,Love Clark‚Äôs always- esp for a wide footed woman like me
ElementaryTeachers,"I wear Georgia Boot Romeos. With inserts ( I have wide and flat feet). I can‚Äôt wear their safety toe version though because it rubs the top of my foot. 

Don‚Äôt forget be good socks too."
ElementaryTeachers,Indescribable Shoes!
ElementaryTeachers,vans :)
ElementaryTeachers,Tieks is amazing! Super comfy. I have very wide feet and they don‚Äôt hurt at all. I have the fuchsia color and it goes with all my outfits!
ElementaryTeachers,I also recommend Brooks running shoes if you are allowed to wear sneakers. Super comfortable.
ElementaryTeachers,"I wear all black Under Armor running shoes. I don't think many non-teachers realize how much we're on our feet all day so comfortable shoes are a must. I keep track of  my steps and I rack up 8,000+ steps on a regular day of teaching."
ElementaryTeachers,"If you have an off broaway shoe near you, they pretty much always have buy one get one 50% off . They can be a little pricier, but if you're looking for something extra comfortable they would have something nice for you with a good deal. I've also been happy with my Steve Madden Women's Beale Sneaker."
ElementaryTeachers,I love my everlane day heels for my dressed up days. I think they stopped making them but they had just enough cushion for me (i have a really low arches so too much cushion is really uncomfortable). Toms also has some cute sandals.
ElementaryTeachers,"I wear Brooks running shoes. I have the Ghost 12 and absolutely love them. Not super stylish, but very comfortable."
ElementaryTeachers,My best advice is to spend time calling or visiting each family you have in your class! I do that instead of a paper.
ElementaryTeachers,"If you feel stronger in another subject area/grade level and you have the opportunity to switch, then go for it. But be aware that it's not going to change the pressure and feeling like you can't get it all done. That's just what teaching is."
ElementaryTeachers,"So many positives‚Äîyou love the kids, your admin says you‚Äôre good and they‚Äôre happy with your work, you have an amazing mentor teacher who helps you out so much,  and you love your colleagues.  Could it be that your expectations are too high? Every child will not end their year with you excited about Reading and Writing and doing it successfully.  How are you measuring success? You say you ‚Äúspend hours trying to plan effective lessons to make sure ALL of my students get equal opportunity to learn the skills.‚Äù Move away from the word ‚Äúall‚Äù. It‚Äôs simply not going to happen. For hundreds of reasons, even the best, most experienced teachers with engaging, effective plans will not reach every student. It‚Äôs not because they failed.  It‚Äôs because too many other things affect learning‚Äîhome life, cognitive skills, whether a child had a good breakfast‚Ä¶you just can‚Äôt solve every problem.
So please try to relax, and lower your expectations for yourself and the kids. Focus on all the positives‚Äîyou are so lucky to have them. Cut the hours of planning. Measure your success differently‚Äîare most of the kids engaged and learning? Good! That‚Äôs enough. Remember, you may never know the effects you may be having on a child. They may not show any success in your class at the time, but maybe years later they‚Äôll say you were their favorite teacher, and you are the reason they love Reading. And the biggest reason of all to just sit back and not make any sudden changes when it sounds like you are a wonderful teacher‚Ä¶your teaching career started and continues during the most abnormal, difficult and unprecedented time ever in the lives of your students, their parents, and you. You‚Äôre doing a great job! Don‚Äôt give up! Give yourself grace, and thank you for caring so much."
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey, unless it's free it shouldn't be on here."
ElementaryTeachers,Your post history is wild.
ElementaryTeachers,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ElementaryTeachers,"I'm in IA. First grade really surprised me with how much they know and how much they still want to learn. I did not like first grade when I was in school, and I think that contributed to my not wanting to teach first grade. But I am so happy that's where I ended up!"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm in NC. Yeah I always thought I wanted to teach upper grades but absolutely LOVE first grade!
ElementaryTeachers,"Yay! Where do you teach?
I always thought I only wanted to teach kindergarten and getting into first grade I'd be able to move grades... Now I don't think is ever want to trade first grade!"
ElementaryTeachers,I teach first grade! This will be my fifth year!
ElementaryTeachers,Reminds me of a response my student gave on a 4th grade math inventory assessment. The question was a picture of a trapezoid and it said to name the quadrilateral. He wrote ‚ÄúDave.‚Äù
ElementaryTeachers,I have several students who are displaying low reading levels but have at least some phonemic awareness and are reading the pictures. We have a new curriculum that really pushes reading and writing every day and encourages building a community around reading and writing and just loving books and talking about books. I'm so excited to see how the kids grow as readers!
ElementaryTeachers,"Thanks for pushing them to catch up before they hit third, when ""learning to read"" turns into ""reading to learn."""
ElementaryTeachers,Preschool. My favorite is kindergarten because I'm also a Reading Specialist and love teaching them how to read. They go from alphabet knowledge to real reading and it's very exciting.
ElementaryTeachers,I taught 1st for many years! Love that grade! You see their reading ability grow so much in 1st! I‚Äôm in second grade this year. It‚Äôs the year that someone can really catch those who didn‚Äôt learn to read and push them to catch up. You‚Äôre going to LOVE first!
ElementaryTeachers,I'm so excited for it all! Already I'm seeing a lot of growth and we're only 2 1/2 weeks in! What grade do you teach now?
ElementaryTeachers,I'm in my 9th year teaching in Virginia. I taught first grade for 3 years. Great grade where you get to see so much growth.
ElementaryTeachers,"Me ‚Äúthe subject matter in art is The Who or the what in the picture, who or what is in the picture?‚Äù
Student a: ‚ÄúA blue horse?‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúyes the subject matter is a blue hores. It is what we see in the picture‚Äù
Student b raises hand, ‚Äúso do we write math or science for subject matter?‚Äù Totally seriously."
ElementaryTeachers,[It's Elemental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcS3NOQnsQM)
ElementaryTeachers,I also want to know.
ElementaryTeachers,"Salary depends on state (I started at 55k myself). You should look up salary guides where you plan to get your certification and see if it‚Äôs a good fit.

But with that said, if you‚Äôre going into the profession for the money (beyond earning livable wages, of course), there‚Äôs something wrong!"
ElementaryTeachers,I‚Äôm pursuing my doctorate in curriculum and instruction and I‚Äôm still teaching kindergarten daily. I don‚Äôt plan on leaving the classroom. Besides with the shortage on teachers you should be fine.
ElementaryTeachers,"Depends on where you are. In Texas, most districts pay about 2K more for doctorate degrees (not worth it), but you have more ops for advancement. I'm of the opinion that all admin should have classroom teaching experience of 5+ years, and my district and those close by agree in some fashion. If you really want to TEACH, start now and get the EdD while you work."
ElementaryTeachers,"Doctorate in education.
Usually on pay scales they cost quite a lot and it's unusual for doctors to still be in the classroom."
ElementaryTeachers,They have a hard time finding teachers due to covid.  I dont think you will have a problem finding a job
ElementaryTeachers,"Not quite sure what an EdD is... but I've never heard someone being turned down for being ""overqualified."" Most industries would be happy to snatch talent at a discount (if you are as over qualified as you say you'll be). 

For example I transitioned to teaching from having worked in the film industry for over 10 years. Interviewers' eyes would light up and give me the ""really... you wanted to teach elementry instead?"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,"Apologies. It might be called ‚Äùhigh ceiling, low floor‚Äù in the US. Risk refers to risk of failure. So, basically, the kinds of activities that most students can access with minimal support, preferably in groups, but could be individually or whole group depending on the activity. Here in Australia, the same teacher teaches all subjects up to Grade 6, so any subject. I was just chasing general favourite activities. 

I don't have any specific gaps to fill as yet. I was just asking about general ideas for what came to mind... but obviously that doesn't fly :) Thanks anyway."
ElementaryTeachers,Google ‚ÄúSaving Sam Stem Activity‚Äù.
ElementaryTeachers,High challenge for whom? The average 3rd grader or advanced ones?  Are these activities they can do alone or is it something you‚Äôll all do together?  What do you mean low-risk?  Low risk of failure or low risk of injury?  What subjects are you looking for?
ElementaryTeachers,"Ah yes, the students much see my modern furnishings in order for me to win their respect and for them to grow educationally. This is definitely not a product made for an entirely different purpose and market being thrown at teachers to see if it sticks!"
ElementaryTeachers,[removed]
ElementaryTeachers,"Well if you $3 won‚Äôt break the bank, I just got this one from TPT that I would like. [editable Back to School Template](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Back-to-School-Meet-the-Teacher-Editable-Brochure-3350012)"
ElementaryTeachers,"There‚Äôs a lot of options for free meet the teacher templates, just make sure to check off free in the price preference when you search for them."
ElementaryTeachers,"If it had anything to do with the certification then I wouldn't have even made it to the interview. Information about my cert is very blatantly, clearly stated on my resume and in my portfolio."
ElementaryTeachers,"Oh it‚Äôs a shit show out here. Here are my opinions on why teachers are not getting jobs right now: we just don‚Äôt know what parents are going to do because of this delta variant. And we can‚Äôt pay teachers unless we have students enrolled. In my district, teacher cuts for low enrollment happen in the Spring. So if you are offered a contract now, and the students withdraw/disenroll, they still have you under contract and have to pay you/find a place for you to work. But it IS possible that we are already over-staffed‚Ä¶ School here doesn‚Äôt start until September, so my best guess is hiring frenzy in August. There is also substitute teaching as a way to get your ‚Äúfoot in the door.‚Äù But we both know that‚Äôs no benefits and not a living wage. Last year we did remote than hybrid. Parents are not going to go for that again. And you have both camps: parents who don‚Äôt want them face to face because of the varient, parents who will send their kids to school‚Äîbut not with a mask and some parents who will only send their kids if they all wear masks. The ONLY teachers I have heard of getting jobs are in Special Education. So we wait. Hope the Delta/Lambda Greek alphabet of COVID goes away and schools can open so teachers can teach. 
If you have a Master‚Äôs Degree, you can potentially teach at the community college level (maybe even some early childhood education courses??). Good luck, chin up!! üçÄ‚ù§Ô∏èüç©"
ElementaryTeachers,"Perhaps it the type of certification you received, is one recognized in most states?"

ElementaryTeachers,"Unfortunately there is no finger trick for smaller numbers (except maybe for 3, check out this link: [3 times table hands on](https://images.app.goo.gl/SVm6AW8VpuK4nJ2CA)
), 
though we can focus on some patterns on the multiplication table (e.g. symmetry of the table), learning how to count by 3 or 5 etc, so if you are interested in some more - less hands-on tricks - you have a look 
[here](https://youtu.be/nJhLMG9CScs)

and go directly to chapter 2 (multiplication table)

Hope that helps mate!"
ElementaryTeachers,Welcomes. Is there any method for low numbers 1-5 x 6-9 using a finger method as well. Can‚Äôt tel you how much I geeked out on this. My wife says thank you as well. She teaches 4th.
ElementaryTeachers,"Hey you are welcome, I‚Äôm really happy you want to share this trick with your students! They will love it! ;)"
ElementaryTeachers,[deleted]
ElementaryTeachers,Getting your masters is a great option because most teachers get their masters! It is one of the main ways educators get a raise. I would also check out emporia state. They are primarily a teaching college and offer a well priced online masters program. Good luck!
ElementaryTeachers,"This is great! Can‚Äôt wait to share it with my students, thank you!"
ElementaryTeachers,"[NASA STEM](https://www.nasa.gov/stem) has a ton of K-12 activities and lessons. I really enjoyed their activities during my STEM camp during summer school. 

[www.mysteryscience.com](https://www.mysteryscience.com) and [www.mysterydoug.com](https://www.mysterydoug.com) are Science based videos by the same company that takes a phenomena and make an interactive video on the topic. MS also has hands on written lessons as well. 

Best of luck."
ElementaryTeachers,"I‚Äôm going to try out classroom checkout this year to keep track of everything. I‚Äôm an art teacher so my plan will be image reference books, art how-to books, and fiction, preferably illustrated versions. I‚Äôm not getting further detailed than that. I don‚Äôt have a large enough library yet to worry about a more complex system"
ElementaryTeachers,"Great strategy.. always look for hands on methods for students to not get hung on basics in lieu of problem solving. 

This is literally hands on. 

Excellent post."
ElementaryTeachers,"I organized my books in Fiction in half grade level steps using ATOS method (find this to be most suitable for my first and second graders) ex: 0.5-1.0 1.0-1.5 etc. 

For Non-Ficiton, I sorted based on genre sticker as well as ATOS level. 

For my labels, I used Avery Labels with color code with each level or genre.

Certain collections or series that were popular (MTH, ...Black Lagoon etc) also gained a bin or container. 

For your set up and library, I would suggest tubs to go into the cubes. If you have an IKEA, look at Billy bookshelves or Home Depot online for three-four shelf ones. 

Sourcing books: Scholastic Book Club, Half Price Books, Library resale, and First Book Marketplace (if you are Title 1 teacher). 

Best of luck. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions."
ElementaryTeachers,Same!
ElementaryTeachers,"I teach first grade as well. For years past we have used Lucy Caulkins so my library was leveled. I had separate bins for levels A-M, some of the more popular levels had 2 bins. Then I color coded the bins and told students what color they could pick from. So like levels A-D was one color, then E-G, then H-L was another color. So students could still pick a range of book levels, but closer to their level as well. 

I also had 2 bins of multi level ‚Äúfiction‚Äù books (majority of these books were L level or higher) and 1 bin of multi level ‚Äúnonfiction‚Äù books, then a bin of alphabet books. I called these ‚Äúdessert books‚Äù. 

Students could pick out 5 books a week, but a max of 2 dessert books. My library consisted of 4 half sized bookcases. 

This year our county is switching to ‚ÄúScience of Reading‚Äù and they do not like leveled libraries so my library will be changing. I would suggest speaking to your team members if you should do leveled vs unleveled library. It goes with the curriculum you are teaching. Good luck üëçüèª"
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes!! When I first chose my major and was telling people what I was going to school for, all of my high school friends were like ""okay... Well what else are you going to study?"" Because apparently elementary education in and of itself just isn't worthwhile and is an easy degree. I worked damn hard to get where I am today and I know none of them could do it or have the know-how to see a group of kids and know what to do or see a pile of random materials and realize it has a valuable lesson that will benefit the kids."
ElementaryTeachers,"Our school district uses Lucy Caulkins Reading and Writing Workshop so our classroom libraries are leveled for the most part using the Fountas and Pinnell reading levels. 

I teach fourth grade and organize my library into two main sections: fiction and non-fiction. Books are put into plastic bins/baskets with the reading levels on the outside for fiction and by subject for non-fiction books then put on book shelves. I keep my picture books in separate, larger baskets. 

It was tedious but each book has its reading level labelled on the back with a sharpie. I have also labelled each book with my classroom name and whether its fiction or non-fiction using return printed address labels stuck to the bottom back of each book. 

I have some dedicated fiction baskets for popular series instead of reading level such as Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I Survived, Sports stories, comics/anime, Fantasy, etc. My non-fiction is by subject such as History, Animals, STEM, Sports, etc. 

Hope that helps and good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,"I wondered about subject matter. I'm going through my books and found I have some that are all the same character, like Pete the Cat and Junie B. Jones, and then I have a lot of Kevin Henkes and Mo Willems, but I overthink and second guess myself a lot and doubted that author, character, and subject matter could all work simultaneously."
ElementaryTeachers,"I do a lot of smaller plastic bins with labels according to subject matter: animals, planets, insects, sports, poetry, etc.  also some by author  or series if there are enough of those: Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Cam Jansen, My Weirder School, etc.
Good Luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,Thank you to everyone who has seen this and signed!
ElementaryTeachers,"I can see how wonderful the power of a good teacher is. You sound just as calm and encouraging as one should be. Twelve years is a long journey! Thank you, friend."
ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is such a difficult job.  I'm on year 12.  I moved into a Media Specialist position two years ago.  I'm still unsure of my ability, but I try to improve through reflection and knowledge.  Hang in there.  Really think about your future.  There are no right or wrong paths! Just keep going forward and listening to your heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ElementaryTeachers,This comment has come on a day where I was completely in shambles. Felt really nice to read this.
ElementaryTeachers,Procedures!  Read Harry Wong.  It really does set the tone for the year.  Giving students a guide and expectations is a gift!
ElementaryTeachers,"Be good to yourself.  This career is learned through experience.  You will look back on this first year with wisdom and laugh at your mistakes.  Keep them alive, make sure they are taken care of, and get them home.  You will grow as a teacher each day!  Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,A label maker is a great tool to stay organized!
ElementaryTeachers,"My kids love Brainpop Jr videos for Science. There‚Äôs also great YouTube videos (SciShow Kids). Another thing I do with my students is a RAN chart. It‚Äôs kinda like a KWL chart but it‚Äôs a little more similar to the scientific method. The categories are What We Think We Know, Wonderings, Confirmed, Misconceptions, New Learning. 
I do these with first graders and they work!"
ElementaryTeachers,"First grade teacher here! I spent a ton on my classroom and looking back there are definitely somethings I would do differently! 
1) Personal laminator and lamination sleeves. I have a scotch one from Amazon and it‚Äôs great! She can use it to make class decor or activities! 
2) They have ‚Äúvisual timers‚Äù for different intervals and the color disappears as the time passes. A little pricey but I love it and my students do too! 
3) Pricey item here but: I have an Apple Watch and I love it. It‚Äôs great during the day because I get texts or alerts from parents on it, I can set timers, check the weather, etc. without having to keep up with my phone!"
