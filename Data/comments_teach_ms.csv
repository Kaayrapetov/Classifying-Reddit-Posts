Middleschoolteachers,I'm going on my 13th year of teaching middle school science. PM me your personal e-mail and I'll send you anything you need. 8th grade is my favorite!
Middleschoolteachers,"Setting limits in the classroom. I teach middle school but would be applicable to any age level, really. I read this every summer."
Middleschoolteachers,"We had to read this book called CHAMPS a few years ago. I didn't follow it 100%, but I took some good stuff from there (like posting behavior expectations and earning behavior parties). 

I teach middle school, but I could see this going down to elementary and perhaps working with higher grades if tweaked even more. "
Middleschoolteachers,We middle school science teachers are a special breed.  Welcome to the club!  Don't die.  :)
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught for over three decades as all grades levels. For a short time I taught middle school language arts. My advice comes less from my direct experience in the classroom than from watching more children grow and learn. They are both adults now. They are very well educated and very successful. When they were young, I watched they play video games and while many parents and teachers were dismayed by the whole video game phenomenon, I observed that my boys were learning among other things literary elements as they played. In you case I would suggest that you might start within the students' experience and begin to ask them about the games they play. As they talk about it begin to put labels on the elements they describe and begin to say it reminds you of something you read... This could become a springboard into discussions in which the connections between games within their experience and books not with their experience come to be seen as part of the same thing."
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught middle school art in an alternative school last year and would continue to work there in a heartbeat if our program wasn't cut. The beginning of the year before you get to know the kids will be the hardest part...once you build rapport and maintain consistency your life will be much easier. Don't ever let them get to you...they will say/do some crazy shit occasionally, but it's not personal so don't take it personally. Be strict and consistent on enforcing rules, but also be compassionate and reasonable. If the kids know that you don't bend on things because that's just the way it is, but you don't have anything personal against them, they're much more cooperative. Good luck!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach an EBD program in a public school, middle school setting. I have 10 students that are isolated from general education to varying degrees. They perform at various instructional levels ranging from 1.5 through 12. 


What is the nature of your alternative setting? Is it primarily behavioral? "
Middleschoolteachers,"What level are you teaching? I teach middle school and I find myself frequently using graphic organizers, which really focuses student attention to the most important parts of the text. I use the Cornell note system infrequently as well (although this skill takes time to develop in the middle school).

As a side note, regardless of your note-taking system, I would recommend having a lesson focus question (preferably open-ended or provocative) which students are expected to engage with throughout the lesson and be able to answer at the end. Throughout the lesson this question can also serve as a guide to note-taking, discussion, and checks for understanding.

I would also recommend (sorry if this is too much) developing a simple annotation system for students as they engage with the text. That why you can identify their skill-level or understanding of the text and also ensure that they are active readers. 

This past year I used Interactive Student Notebooks and it greatly helped student organization (middle school :)). 

Good luck on your first year of teaching! Enjoy it! "
Middleschoolteachers,"I am a huge believer if it ain't broke don't fix it, just model it and it's something they can use all the way through college. As a teacher you want to be on the cutting edge, but understanding how and why to take notes will always be an essential skill for success, notes will be around for for middle school, high school and in college. Professors do not give a shit on new trends in education, they are still teaching the same will and most likely will for years to come. If anything Cornell notes will get them ready for the 21st century. You just can't do them everyday or your children will murder you."
Middleschoolteachers,"Amen.  This wouldn't work for most elementary school kids who don't always see the value in learning.  Despite what everyone seems to think, not every child likes spending hours a day in front of a computer, and no matter how much data a computer can take in, there is no way for it to deliver any sort of feasible consequence to a child.  Forget the fact that it requires a child to be self motivated to login for it to even work.  I can't imagine what this would look like for kids who have any sort of disability in areas of executive function, auditory or visual processing, fine motor skills or emotional and behavior issues.  

Having delivered an ""engaging"" computer based program, my kids grew tired of it a month in and actually asked to read books instead (middle school).  A lot of the programs require a lot of repetition to reteach for errors and that drains on a kid who struggles with learning.  One would also have account for the social piece in that we would still need these computer-based environments in areas where kids can be social...or a society of kids who don't understand body language?  Parents will be responsible for socializing them? 

I'm sure computers will become more prominent in helping to personalize learning environments to meet the needs and interests of students, I just don't imagine how we would completely remove the human component.  Even if it's just to make sure the kid doesn't spend the entire day out at ""recess""."
Middleschoolteachers,I taught for a few years casual now been ongoing for a few. Try not to let it bother you with the other teachers. The one's complaining about how easy you have it are probably the ones putting in little effort. I manage the middle school now and make it a point to offer cover teachers bhav support.
Middleschoolteachers,hmmm I am not sure!! I do know of a math intervention position at a middle school
Middleschoolteachers,"My principal(who is awesome) took a poll of teachers on whether to allow students during individual work time(reading, project work, etc) to use earbuds and play music.  95% of the teachers in my middle school said no.  I along with two science teachers were the only ones who said why not, if kids can concentrate while not bothering others and get their work done I could careless how they do it.  The three of us said screw everyone else and are going to allow our students this illegal privilege.  Side note, I always do what's best for the kids and don't make it a huge issue.  You need your iphone to take a picture of the homework for the week instead of writing it in your planner, fine by me.  Most of the stuff I do is my own classroom rules using the school rules a ""loosely followed template."""
Middleschoolteachers,"I used FOSS kits and texts for 3-5 and loved them. They have them for middle school as well. There were way more experiments than text, but it is fairly easy to add to them. The kids loved them!

Edit: wrong word"
Middleschoolteachers,"The number one thing that my S.O helps me with during the year is making decisions and plans when I am too burnt out from planning for work. Think dinner plans, date nights, even what movie to see. It's a treat to have someone else make a decision and think of all the steps involved.

The other thing that I really value is having an alternative perspective on lesson plans. It's wonderful to be able to ask someone ""Would you find this boring as a middle school kid?"" or ""What would make this more engaging to you if you had to sit through this lesson?"". I've gotten some fantastic ideas this way!"
Middleschoolteachers,"A big hit when I taught middle school was having the students draw little comics to help them remember the definitions of the vocabulary words. 

I also did synonyms, antonyms, fill-in-the-blank, provide a definition in your own words, write your own sentence, and I even did a decide from context / ""find it in the story"" (like a scavenger hunt) but I gave them page numbers. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks for the recommendation. My wife worked in an elementary public school here in St. Louis for a year and the horror stories I heard terrified me. I've been working as a TA and middle school elective teacher at a character-driven charter and love it. But, I'm going to begin teaching high school English next year, more than likely for St. Louis Public Schools, so I am doing every thing I can to prepare myself for worst case scenario. This book will go a long way to help me center and prepare myself. Thanks again!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I worked in an urban middle school for 2 years. I had many emotional students. Instead of yelling or getting mad at students, I found it was better to make a joke and be sassy. It also helped to talk to the students about their behavior once they calmed down. 

A book all my students love was Forged by Fire. I believe the main character is in high school and it is about how he deals living with an abusive step dad. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school science. My district requires us to have certain things posted in our rooms (examples of student work, LFS information, AVID things, etc.) but in addition to that I have some motivational/positive thinking posters, various science related things like the periodic table and the scientific method. 

I relied heavily on color to spruce things up a bit, since each classroom has much of the same type of things on the walls. I use glitter/sparkle letters where I can, lots of bright blue and green for my vocab on my word wall and my bookshelves are painted. It's working out nicely for me."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was the student council adviser for middle school for two years. Some things we did for community service that went off well were penny wars ([explained here if you are not familar)](http://www.pennies.org/index.php/how-to-conduct-a-penny-fundraising-drive), pay to wear a hat for a day, bake sales, Valentine delivery (cards and candy), and Christmas gift wrapping service, just to name a few. We would then use the money raised to donate to a charity of the kids choice. I think a lot of these could be adapted to younger students if need be.  Either way have the kids come up with some idea as well. Students just want to be a part of it and have some say. Just let me know if you have any questions; I'd be glad to help!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm middle school math, too.  
* I found some motivational phrases and flower wall art at the dollar store  
* framed photos of my husband, cats, and parents which the kids like asking about
* a SLANT classroom engagement poster
* pennants from favorite sports teams
* diplomas 
* a bulletin board that I add news articles, drawings from students, flyers
* This year I'm going to add a ""Kudos Wall"" which is an idea I stole from a colleague.  Neither of us handout candy or toys as prizes, but she lets the kids sign a large piece of paper stuck to the wall for winning games, good grades, or whatever else.  Apparently they LOVE it.

Other than that, I don't have a lot of generic stuff.  
* I make a lot of my math posters that have topics I reference frequently such as order ops, divisibility rules, etc.  
* make anchor charts with the kids to summarize an idea then hang it up when it's done.  Mine don't look pretty like the ones on Pinterest, but they are referenced by the kids frequently.  
* a word wall that I add to as we learn new words.  I found some pocket charts in the dollar bin at target and I write on some long, rectangular tagboard cards from the teacher store.

Kids love to see their own work hanging on the walls, too.  Attaching clothes pins to the wall will command adhesive or hot glue makes it easy to change things out."
Middleschoolteachers,Still looking for my first middle school teaching job. But I expect to continue adjunct teaching classes in two universities masters programs.
Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks. The modeling workshop by me was full by the time I tried to attend, but I'm definitely planning on doing it next summer. I took a seminar on inquiry based science, which seems close, but was geared more towards middle school. I'm trying to find resources for actual activities to run. I'll definitely take a look at the blogs. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I tutor high school (and sometimes middle school) math. Lots of money to be made there. I started off slow when I was in college as a way to make ends' meet. Now, as a teacher, it's a good way to spend money on hobbies."
Middleschoolteachers,"Nope. I make enough, so I don't need the extra money.

However, I love to coach sports.  I basically am coaching year round at a middle school level.

It is rewarding to coach students and I find they are more respectful and listen better in the classroom.

Time management can be difficult.  Deciding what to focus on at the end of the day. Especially when sports are so fun:)"
Middleschoolteachers,There might be a middle school art position opening but I am not 100% certain if it will end up getting posted. I originally wanted to be an art teacher and landed in humanities and have really loved it (but I miss art!)
Middleschoolteachers,"Thats the thing, my middle school generalist license wouldn't reciprocate, so they just 'gave' me a high school English license.

Crazy, but true."
Middleschoolteachers,Can you teach high school with a middle school generalist license?  
Middleschoolteachers,"My students can earn different passes for good behavior. I have a good call home pass, choose a song to play during the warm up (must be appropriate) pass, choose your partner pass, late pass and skip a warm up pass. 
I'm not totally consistent about giving them out so I have to remind myself a lot, but I find they really work. I teach middle school and they really like them. "
Middleschoolteachers,I know of 2 middle school math/science and 2 high school math off the top of my head!
Middleschoolteachers,"My husband managed to get the summer off with me. He works in manufacturing, and his company has been shut down for some major renovations, so we've had gobs and gobs of time together. It has been wonderful because normally we're like two ships passing in the night with schedules opposite each other, so I am really going to miss being able to spend so much time with him going on adventures and just being able to connect. Also, pretty much everything that you mentioned in your post! 

This year I'll be at the middle school level and all of my previous experience is high school, so I'm looking forward to a new challenge and a change of gears! I don't have children of my own, so I'm also really looking forward to the simple day to day interactions with the kids, too."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm a middle school physical science teacher with 12 years of experience. Let me give you some hints.

Don't just do notes. Notes are boring. The first thing you should do is figure out how you want to break your class up into units. Measurement. Linear motion. Circular motion. Things like that. 

After you have decided what your first unit will be, decide what kinds of activities you want your students to do. If you're starting with something really simple like displacement and speed and simple linear motion, work out what you want to cover as notes and how you want to then implement that knowledge. Find some worksheets where they apply the formulas that you are teaching. Then, create (or borrow) hands on labs that the kids can use.

I like to start with the big picture. *What are my over all topics?* Then, I look at the subtopics of those topics. *What exactly do the kids need to know about this?* Then, I look at how I can make them use the knowledge. *What's an activity that we can do?*

Once you've gotten that out of the way, I suggest breaking your class period into manageable chunks. 5 minutes to go over last night's homework. 20 minutes of direct instruction/guided practice. 10 minutes of independent practice/go over that independent practice. 10 minutes to start on tonight's homework. Tomorrow there will be a lab. (Don't really have a lab every other day. You'll drive yourself insane.)

Work on one unit at a time. Spend the first week getting to know the kids and assessing their level of knowledge. 

Don't beat yourself up when things don't work. Heck, there are times when I say to my students, ""Okay, kids, I've never done this before. This whole thing could crash and burn. Let's see what happens."" They're usually pretty cool with that.

Oh, and one last thing, high school kids can be big assholes. Don't let them get to you. Don't try to be their friend. Don't try to get them to think you're cool. Just go in there and teach."
Middleschoolteachers,"I guess just resources. For instance, in the math middle school world - I loved Dan Dyer and his resources. Who are the goto's for 9th grade ELA?"
Middleschoolteachers,"My school is Standards Based grading, so I give the opportunity to re-test or turn in missing class assessments(worksheets, etc) without taking off a late penalty prior to the end of the grading period. This usually does not result in a high number of students attempting, but some do. 

I teach Robotics, and it can be easy to turn certain projects into competitions. I give the basic goal of the project, requirements for success, and the time frame. Sometimes I give donuts (sugar works wonders on middle schoolers' motivation) or other treats to the group that makes and programs the fastest, strongest, or most precise robot. I think it gives more motivation than a few points here or there."
Middleschoolteachers,A girl high on E puked right outside my door my first year teaching (at a middle school).  
Middleschoolteachers,"Disclaimer: Music Teacher

What do you love about your job?

The kids. They are curious and willing to learn about anything. Even on my worst days they motivate me to do a better job which in turn motivates them. It is a glorious cycle. 

What do you hate about your job?

The paperwork. I teach all 500+ kids at my school which means my IEP, 504, Behavior issues folder is about 8 inches tall. With the little planning time I'm given it is impossible to keep up with it all. 

How easy is it to find a job as a newly qualified elementary school teacher?

I started at middle school my first year and only moved to elementary for year 3 and this coming year number 4. It took me 6 months to find a job but I moved at the end of January/December so the timing was bad. I would say for music it really depends on the area, even as much as 20-30 miles one direction can make a huge different in job availability. 

What are the main differences between grades 1-3 and grades 4-6?

I teach down to PreK. So I will start there. The little ones, Prek and K, are very shy at first and I spend a lot of time getting them to be comfortable in the room and comfortable to sing/play instruments and not be afraid of making mistakes. After we get rolling though they are a blast and I feel like I can do anything with them.

1-2 They are similar to the lower grades still however they are already willing to do everything without having to convince them. They are mostly happy to do something besides sit at a desk for another hour. 

3-5 is a difficult group, particularly coming in as a new music teacher. They don't like to sing in front of new people as singing is now a girls and little kids thing so I have to be sneaky about how I get them to do it. The best thing about the big kids is that I don't have to do much set up anymore. Orff day? they get them out and put them away. Percussion day? same. playing a game? they do it all and it saves a ton of set up time for me that I have to do for the little kids a lot. 

What is your favorite grade to teach?
PreK and K. Least favorite is 5th grade. But I still love all my kids and tell them regularly. 

If you could do it all again, would you choose the same career path? Why or why not?

Yes. I love my job and sometimes it is hard to consider it work since I get to play games, sing, and play instruments all day. There is still a heavy curriculum in teaching singing, note reading, rhythms, and vocabulary however it can all be taught in a very hands on, fun way. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach STEM classes at a middle school.  My district switched over to Project Lead the Way just over 3 years ago, but with my old curriculum I used several free sources to enhance the curriculum software we had. I'm sure you can use some of these to build some lessons.  I will also list some other websites that I currently use.  

**West Point Bridge** -  https://bridgecontest.org   --  Free Engineering and Bridge building software. The have a national contest that students can enter, but it's not required.  My student's loved using this program.  My students used this while also building bridges out of balsa wood strips which we tested to see how much force they could hold. (I realize that this is more Engineering than Technology, but was't sure where you needed to take your curriculum. I could probably give you some of my old resources for the balsa bridges if your interested.)  I'm pretty sure the West Point website will have something that you can use to create lessons.  

**Code.org** - lots of good sources to teach coding to students.  The even have a lesson for teachers that don't have computers for the students to use.    http://code.org

**Graphic Design** - https://pixlr.com - Pixlr Editor and Pixlr Express - free online graphic design programs that students can use to modify and transform photos.

You could also do a **""STEM Investigation""** - Students pick a type of technology - one that they are unfamiliar with! - research it - history, inventor(s), uses, etc. - and then create a powerpoint/Google Slides to share with the class.  (I can definitely send you some resources for this)
"
Middleschoolteachers,"As a fellow middle school Technology Education teacher I feel as if I can help with this...the county I work for spent a bunch of money to create curriculum for all Career and Technology Education, but there are three that pertain to Middle School Tech Ed.

 So, if you go to [](http://cteresource.org/verso/categories/science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics) and search for ""Introduction to Technology"" that is 6th grade and there are different lengths for the classes, ""Inventions and Innovations"" is 7th, and ""Technological Systems"" is 8th grade. 

Each of these groupings has different standards and within the standards are projects and stuff you can use! Hope this helps! Let me know if you need any other help!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I do like letting students choose seats, but this doesn't work quite as nicely in middle school. For the last two years, I've been tracking behavior with Class Dojo (which I love but will stop using because it makes me more of a judge and less of a scorekeeper; I'm going to have students fill out rubrics for themselves instead). If any class scored above 90% for a seating chart period (about a month), they'd earn the right to sit where they want. Nothing brought down a class's behavior quite so quickly. And the problem was that the four troublemakers would sit together and when I needed to break them up... there was nowhere to move them to without taking away a strong student's hard-earned right to choose his/her seat. I'll consider your rule of forced separation and see whether I can work that in later. Thanks."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have taught both high school and middle school. When I was single, I had this freakishly small class scheduled at the high school -- only about 17 students by some fluke in the counseling office.  Somehow, they figured out I was dating (either overheard me talking to another teacher or pieced it together from me not talking about a boyfriend or husband).  They teased me relentlessly but were adorably good-natured about it. It was a writing class so every time we did a sample assignment on the board and they got to choose the topic, it would either be about a bad date or a euphemism for sex. Some of their creative writing pieces sent me on dates with Ronald McDonald and Andrew Lincoln from *The Walking Dead*. We made outlines for breakfast food that got entirely creepy based on their insistence that you must PROTECT your lap with a napkin before eating. I mean, truly, it was all so ridiculous but completely silly and harmless in the end. Not that every class would react that way and turn out so positive, but it sort of restored my faith in [teenage] humanity. 

When I taught middle school, I was already with my SO. High schoolers usually ask like ""What does he do?"" or ""What kind of car does he drive?"" but the middle schoolers wanted to know (and I could not make this up), ""Does he have hair in his armpits?"" "
Middleschoolteachers,"Especially for high school, math positions are hard to fill because they can go to into something other than teaching for a lot more money.  I am a hs math teacher and I essentially have a math degree with a teaching certificate.  If I wanted, I could look into many different options for careers because I have had so much math.  That is the difficulty we have ran into in the past.  Not so sure about middle school, but I would imagine it is a very similar situation."
Middleschoolteachers,"I think it's helpful for people who may just need an idea from where to start. I also think it's more helpful to those who teach lower grades. I teach middle school setting and found it completely useless for my setting, but only because I thought it suited a more elementary level where some of those strategies could be applied. "
Middleschoolteachers,Florida is decent. There is a huge market for middle school math. The unions are very very strong.
Middleschoolteachers,"I think it depends, as a single person, I share absolutely nothing about my dating life.  However, I do let the kids get to know me as a person.  I teach middle school and my students know about my pets, that I like to read and craft... that my sister is a teacher... very benign details."
Middleschoolteachers,"Number one is behind true for me. My parents live in the neighborhood where I teach. I grew up in that neighborhood and I know what it's like to go through middle school in that neighborhood. There are times where stuff is going on in the neighborhood so my sisters and I hang out. When I'm not in school, I'm in shorts and t-shirt. Inevitably, I see students and their families. I never knew how emotionally exhausting it would be to be in teacher mode while I'm out with family. I'm held to an even higher standard because quite a few parents tell me that I'm too young to be a teacher (24 during my first year, turn 25 at the start of year two) because I don't have my own kids. 

That's probably my biggest complaint about teaching...my community has parents that will tell a principal everything. A teacher once got in trouble because a parent told our principal that said teacher was at a bar on a Friday night. Principal laid into this teacher. The teacher didn't even teach this person's child! Ugh. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Also, if you find your passion is there and can, TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL.  There is such a void of middle school teachers that understand the math curriculum that is coming in high school and college and can build the connections for students as they haven't had the math.  Strong teachers that have math backgrounds like yourself are needed so bad.  So many students from middle school enter my classroom with a memorized set of procedures and complete lack of understanding of concepts.  I have so much respect for the folks who certified 6-12 with me that are brave enough to teach middle school kids.  THEY RULE!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I had a pretty fun student teaching experience, but my wife and my roommate both had terrible experiences and ended up changing placements. I'll write about all three separately.


Mine: I was a music ed student. I student taught 6-12 band but going backwards (oldest kids in the morning, 6th graders last period). I had two CTs. The high school CT dropped me in Jazz band to fend for myself from day 1 and dropped me with the lower HS band in week 2. He payed very little attention to what I was doing and let me pretty much roll with the baton. It was fun, but it was scary-like I could easily screw this up and no one would know-scary. In middle school I was watched a little more closely and I had extremely difficult kids (inner-city). Planning for this ate up most of my time, but I always felt like I was skating compared to my wife (fiance at the time) and roommate. I ended up not going into teaching though because of the low pay and politics. 


Wife (Jane for reddit purposes): We'll call her CT Amy (neither real names). Amy expected Jane at school at a particular time. When Jane walked in a square 30 seconds late, it was a *huge* deal. She would regularly tell Jane that she was not as prepared as she should be. Jane would come in and spend ten to thirty seconds to do something in the morning, but be told she should have done it the night before. None of this would have been particularly major were it not for the fact that Amy would report Jane every time. If Jane asked Amy a question -*any* question- she would be told that she was un-prepared. At the end of the first month, Jane was told she had way too much negative paperwork and she might get dropped from Stu-teaching. Jane let Amy report her one more time before requesting a new placement. 


Roommate (John): we'll call his CT Mary (again neither are real names.) Mary was famous in the school for bad-mouthing the other teachers behind their backs and then being perplexed when none of them liked her. She had been at it for years before John became the stu-teacher. Her habit of being negative carried over to John because of his inability to be *impatient* with the students and she would make him write and re-write his lessons until he had two weeks worth of sub-plan like write-ups that scripted exactly like *she* would do it. The last straw was when another teacher told John she had heard Mary saying she didn't think John had done well enough to merit any sort of letter of recommendation. John asked for another CT an hour later and was granted. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I would strongly suggest (if you could) seeing if you even like middle school students. It is a very strange/weird age group and can be rather difficult. I found myself absolutely miserable in middle school.

some people love it or hate it, but there are few that are middle ground (in my experience)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Mine was interesting.  I did my licensure in Memphis before the country and city schools combined so I had a junior high placement at a then Memphis City school and a high school placement at a Shelby County school.  Some background for those who don't know, Memphis has one of the worst school situations in the country, it's absolutely awful, which is why you can make upwards of $70k after a few years, but I digress.  Before the consolidation of the districts (and then the suburbs forming their own districts) it was pretty widely known in our program that Memphis city was to teach you classroom management and Shelby county was to teach you everything else.

So my first placement was in a low-performing middle school teaching 8th grade Social Studies.  I was one of two white men on campus teaching 120 students split about 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic (about half of whom spoke English).  I learned more about managing a classroom in 8 weeks than I ever learned in school.  Luckily, my cooperating teacher was always in the room with me and gave me the backup I needed when I inevitably got accused of racism by the students.  Most of the students were there most of the time but I had about 1/4 who out of the 8 weeks of my assignment I saw them about 5 days.  It was rough, I spent much more time getting kids to sit down and stop fighting than I ever did teacher, which is what convinced me that I am not right for those type of situations.  I did have one honors class that was absolutely delightful, I never had to get on to them and I was able to do a TON of actual teaching with them, which is probably what saved me.

My Shelby county placement was a dream.  I was teaching Honors World History and US Government and after a week of observation, my cooperating teacher told me the classroom was mine and just let me do my thing.  I had complete control and I LOVED it.  I was able to establish relationships with the students and looked forward to going to school everyday.

All in all, my advice is this:  
1. You get out of student teaching what you and your cooperating teacher put into it.  If either of you don't make the effort and try, you won't learn a thing.
2. Next, ask for help!  If you don't get any from your cooperating teacher, site supervisor, or administration, tell someone so you can get it fixed.
3. You will want to quit at some point, try and get through the semester before making any decision about it though"
Middleschoolteachers,"High school placement: was thrown into teaching all classes from day 1. She told me on day 3 I needed to differentiate  more. 2nd week she tells my professor I'm not fit to be a teacher. Did everything in her power to make me feel like I wasn't fit to be a teacher Week 3 another teacher pulls her aside and says how my mentor was a horrible person and I needed to fail. Last week I'm pulled aside and asked what's going on, and how my middle school placement will determine if I pass or not. Mentor teacher hated me.

Middle school: kicked ass. Mentor teacher loved me, I thrived. Students thought I was the coolest teacher. Received praise left and right. Professor apologizes profusely to me after seeing me in action in this new class. I end up being an amazing teacher in this placement. Last day we have cake and soda.

Not to brag, but I'm a pretty good teacher in a high school setting. That first placement teacher was not a good mentor."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm late to the party here, but my plan for the upcoming year (I've seen it used successfully at the middle school level, but am planning to try it with 9th graders) is to have a ""poor choice book"". I'll have a binder hanging by the door and if kids don't follow a rule (they're late, off-task, whatever), they have to sign in the book and write down which rule they broke. If they're in there 3 times in one week they get a lunch detention, and every further infraction after 3 that week gets them another detention. This resets every Monday. I'm hoping this will hold students accountable while also not take away a ton of class time."
Middleschoolteachers,"It was extremely challenging, scary, stressful,  overwhelming, demanding, and the single most rewarding experience of my life so far. I give major props to my credential program for doing it right (CSUF). I had a science degree previously,  so it was one semester of pre-reqs followed by a full year of student teaching along with other classes and the dreaded TPA's. It was so valuable to see the entire arc of a year, from setting it up in the beginning to wrapping it up at the end. I'm not sure i would have felt ready to teach after 12 weeks or one semester. My mentor teacher was a.ma.zing. Within the first week she had provided me with digital copies of all of her resources, along with paper copies of her lesson plans from the previous year. She had impeccable classroom management and helped me out with behavior issues throughout the whole year. Any time I am faced with a difficult situation, I literally think ""what would Mary do?"" She was fine with me using her resources but was also very encouraging when I wanted to take things in a different direction. Obviously there are things I do differently than she does now, a few years in to my career, but she gave me such a great framework for how to run a middle school science classroom. I'm not sure I would have survived without such a fabulous mentor. Because of her, I can't wait to serve as a mentor after I continue to polish my craft for a few more years."
Middleschoolteachers,"It's really gonna depend on your programs and your cooperating teacher. 

I majored in special education in Wisconsin. I had a full year practicum in a middle school history/language arts classroom with a gen ed teacher to learn about that side of things. First semester I was only there one day a week for a few hours. I was basically an assistant, helped with a weekly email to parents and talked planning. The second semester, I was there four hours a day four days a week. It worked out that she had two groups of students, AM and PM. So even though I only saw the AM students, she was just doing the same thing in the afternoon with new kids so I felt like I had a pretty good experience. My teacher was really OK with almost anything. I taught a whole history unit I made and some parts of the day sort of became the time I took over. But mostly I observed and did assistant type things. It was a great opportunity to just talk to a teacher about things like organization, overall curriculum planning, politics around education, etc. 

In my final year, I was a full time student teacher. But in special Ed you're certified k-12 so my first semester was in an elementary school and my second semester was at a high school. 

At the elementary school, I went to the school in August and did PD with my teacher and although it wasn't required, it made the year start off much smoother as I wasn't learning everything all at once (not just being a teacher, but the layout of the school, IEPs of students, met staff before they were in the throes of school year, etc.). My cooperating teacher was awesome! We game planned how each day would go (which SEA would be with which kid, what groups we would need) and planned on me taking one reading and one math group and she would take one reading and one math group. I really felt like I was part of the planning and the team in general (I got a lot of time working with the gen ed teachers we supported too and they let me lead whole class lessons sometime too)  

At the high school level, I planned and taught our self-container math class every day, helped out in the resource room we ran for one block a day and then my cooperating teacher and I supported a gen ed history class. I made alternate materials/assessments and contributed in the history class to the general discussion as best I could (I was also a double major in history so it was a fun class for me to support). 

In our seminars, my fellow student teachers and I would just talk about our weeks. What I really found out was as long as you had a supportive cooperating teacher, the role is really what you make it. Need to practice parent communication? Ask if you can send emails or be the one to make a call home. Classroom management? Come up with something you lead the class in every day that gives you the opportunity to be in front of them.

I remember some girls in my program seeming kind of unsure of what they were doing or feeling like they weren't getting direction from their cooperating teachers, but you really just gotta try things. You can't get fired (unless you're REALLY bad I guess), so don't be afraid to try new things, even if they don't work. You have someone with you to help out in case something goes wrong, a luxury you won't have later. 

Don't be afraid to be unknowledgeable or make mistakes! Even if there was something I thought I knew for sure, I enjoyed playing dumb or naive at times (because you are in a sense! You're only a student teacher. People should be understanding) and trying to get the best advice I could from other teachers. 

Definitely try and meet your teacher and get your feet on the ground in the school a bit before you need to be there to actually teach!"
Middleschoolteachers,"It was interesting. I couldn't decide which grade level I wanted to do since I was being certified grades 7-12, so I was one of very few (maybe the only) in my cohort to split the semester up. I spent 8 weeks in 8th grade at a middle school and 8 weeks in 11th and 12th grade at a high school just down the street from the MS. I was hoping the two experiences would make it clear which age group I preferred, but I really didn't end up with a preference at all (and still don't). My 8th grade placement teacher had me just watch for about 2 weeks, then we co-taught for a bit, then the last 2-3 weeks I pretty much did everything on my own. She had a very clearly outlined curriculum, and I just followed it. I also put in grades and sat in on parent-teacher conferences, all with her oversight.

At my second placement, my teacher quickly let me take over her classes after seeing that I was relatively capable of doing so. By the end of my time there, she rarely came in to school at all (which is highly illegal, but our room was out in BFE and no one ever came to check on us) and I did everything. She wrote me one of the nicest letters I've ever received about how amazing I was as a teacher and how she'd want her kids to have me. Overall, I enjoyed my student teaching and felt relatively prepared.

Yeah, no. Maybe it's because I moved to a different state, or had a totally different student population, but NOTHING about my student teaching prepared me for having my own classroom. My students now are nothing like the ones in my student teaching, and a huge part of teaching is lesson planning, which is pretty much all done for you when you student teach. I had to come up with several of my own (very long and thorough) lesson plans for university administrators when they came to observe me, but other than that, I was following what my cooperating teachers had already had planned. Actually figuring out what you're going to be teaching and how you're going to teach it is a MAJOR part of the time teaching takes outside of the school day, and I wasn't prepared for all of that work and responsibility."
Middleschoolteachers,"Do I what I did.  Raise 1000 dollars through go fund me, buy all new furniture at Ikea.  Create 21st century dream classroom that mimics Apple, Google, any Silicon Valley workspace.  Have kids build all furniture and design open concept seating and collaboration.  Win teacher of the year for innovative work and smile all the way because it was really quite easy!

Edit-This was a middle school social studies class."
Middleschoolteachers,"Moving from high school to 8th grade this year. Made an off the cuff comment while getting shown my room after getting hired when we walked into the chemical store room and saw it stuffed with all kinds of arts and crafts, boxes of decorations and what not. All I said was ""Huh, guess I need to up my arts and crafts game moving to middle school."" and both admins snapped around and the head principal said ""Darlin, I hired a science teacher, not an interior decorator. Focus on good hands on labs not on what's on the walls.""

I like my new admins so far..."
Middleschoolteachers,"Middle school art kicks ass. I taught middle school alternative ed last year and loved it. Be consistent with discipline but be kind. Don't take anything personally. They are likely to blow you away with the things they can accomplish when you allow them to be creative. You're going to have days where you wonder what the fuck you're doing with your life, and you're going to have days where you can't stop smiling because your job is the best thing ever. Feel free to PM me if you want!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I am just looking at Technology Educations perspective in the educational community from non-technology teachers. People think that technology education is just teaching kids to use computers..which it is not. My technology education curriculum covers Electronics, Engineering Design Process, Computer Aided Design, Electro-Mechanics, Computer Numeric Control, Technologies effect on Society, Computer Science, Robotics, Woodworking, metalworking, and some independent study projects of my choosing. I obtained the NYS BEDS data for the number of technology teachers in the state of New York. 

In 1998 there were about 2,792 Technology teachers (2,294 in license--498 out of license), in 2012 by last count there were only 2,463 (2159 in license--304 out of license.) 

The numbers are growing far dimmer, in NYS there are 3 colleges that have technology education majors. Oswego, Buffalo State College, and CUNY City Tech in Brooklyn. Buffalo State, Oswego and City Tech combined are only pumping out about &lt;70 graduates per yer total i would say, probably closer to about 50  I would say. I attended Buff State, our graduating class was last semester, probably had around 15. Only like 3-4 new freshman in the program now.

The problem with technology education is the name! It used to be manual arts, then industrial arts, then technology education and it is slowly transitioning to technology and engineering education now. Also a problem is lack of unified curriculum. Middle school has no real set curriculum at all, its up to the teachers. High school has somewhat more consistency. 

Now remember every middle schooler is required to have a technology credit....even though some schools dont. And there are only 2,463 or less tech teachers for the state. I am teaching in NYC, I would guess that I am 1 of about 5 or 6 certified real technology teachers in a city of over 8 million.. Its mind blowing. It is my first year and I will be designing a engineering curriculum for the middle school. 

Another issue is how teachers percieve us, industrial arts was once the ""room of failures."" We have struggled to overcome this and other educators cannot understand this, they dont get that techology is NOT just computers, it is the theory of design, the theory of structures, farming, electronics, we would define technology as the study of technique, or manipulating our world to suit our needs. However hte average teacher still percieves us as a joke, especially in NYC. However we see this big STEM push, its funny how NO ONE EVER mentions E or T in stem, just math and science, it blows my mind, because engineering is the combined application of science, math and tech. And science and math would not be possible without technology and vice versa.

Another issue is funding, a good tech program requires so much funding most schools cant do it. In the school im working at we have a 3D printer, some smart tables, yet we lack power machines because NYC is so turned off by the idea of leaving a saw in a room with city kids, however I was trained in this....i am a professional, the only thing holding back these programs is lack of funding and administrators not having faith.

So in summary I am a younger teacher, first year, I am designing my own curriculum and will eventually design a 6-8 layered class. Trying to do this with little to no budget, and lack of confidence in me. However we OWE it to urban kids to give them this type of education that many kids in nyc dont get like the kids upstate. I want to change the entire notion of this subject, even if it means one school at a time. Not every kid excels in a traditional classroom, this gives everyone a chance to think creatively, and outside the box and not be constrained by state tests."
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught Composition (11th grade) for several years, so the essays counted as tests. I did a mini unit on plagiarism, going over different ways it could happen and having discussions and practice assignments so the kids could fully understand the concept. Throughout the course, I kept showing them how to avoid plagiarism (citing sources).  Even with all of that, there would usually still be 1-2 students per semester who would do something stupid.

When I taught other grades/courses, I did give a disclaimer as I was handing out tests/quizzes, which I stole and adapted from my mentor teacher way back when I was student-teaching in college. It was this big ridiculous thing I would say as I was passing out the materials, like, ""If you're doing 'x,' I'll have to assume you're cheating. If you're cheating, I will take your [test/quiz] away from you, rip it up, stomp on it, throw it in the recycling bin, do a little dance, and [huge breath]... make you cry! And you're such smart, lovely people, I'd really hate to make you cry today, so it's really better if you don't do 'x.'""  Of course, it always got a laugh and helped relieve a little stress right before the test... and if need be, I would go through it several times with 'x' being something different each time -- talking, looking at someone else's paper, having a phone or electronic device out, using notes or a cheat sheet (if they weren't allowed or I hadn't signed them in, etc.).  

If I had anything kind of complicated going on, like use of cheat sheets but only if they were checked in by a certain date or use of one notes sheet but not another, I would print that at the top of the test/quiz very clearly.  

Another teacher in my building has something on his tests about how the test is not over just because you (the student) finishes, but rather, the test is over when he says it is over. There are some consequences outlined for talking / goofing off before he gives the final word.  I think it helps him manage behavior while everyone has a chance to finish. 

Having taught middle school, I would just point out that they are generally pretty terrible at reading directions, so even if you put a disclaimer on the test, I would read it aloud and point it out to them EVERY TIME.  Heck, I would include the disclaimer on any study/guide materials before the quiz/test -- I found immediately that having something to hand out a week (or more) before the test to prepare them was the only way to avoid 1,000,0000 questions of ""what's the quiz going to be like?"" and ""will that be on the test?"""
Middleschoolteachers,"On top of the ever important establishment of rules and routines, I think getting to know your students is important. I am K/1, so middle school is obviously going to be way different, but I would definitely start creating a classroom community right away. Ask your students questions, have them ask each other questions, have them ask you questions, etc. 


Make connections with parents/families as soon as possible. Send home parent letters prior to school starting, send home an introduction letter, or anything to connect to your parents from the get go in a positive way.


For K, it is important that I introduce my students to the faces of the school, so I present a slideshow of the staff with pictures and names. Depending on how large your school is, that could be helpful for your students.


Good luck! Have a great first week! :)"
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm teach in a middle school.

1)   No parents at all.  I'll only add students after that student and siblings graduate high school.  
One exception:  I have ""liked"" a page got a former student that needed an organ transplant because the family provides updates on her health and links to fundraising.  

2)  I've added most of my co-workers, but I've worked in the district for a long time so I know them all well.  I haven't added any current supervisors, but I am friends with a former admin.  

I still keep my account locked down and watch what I post.  Our union always reminds us to be very careful with social media; they prefer we prefer we obtain completely but most staff doesn't."
Middleschoolteachers,"In California, you won't have too hard a time finding a job as a science teacher. I might expand my options to including middle school. 

I can't specifically speak to which classes you should take since I didn't get my credentials in science, but if you want to teach a particular type of science (like chem) definitely take classes in that. You'll have to enter a credential program for your teaching courses.

Here in CA, tattoos aren't an issue. One of the new hires at my school has a sleeve tattoo that she keeps covered with long sleeves. There's a bunch of other teachers with tattoos on their feet or on their shoulders and they're never asked to cover them.

Something to know about: Being a teacher is about connecting with your students. If you are a task-oriented person instead of a people-oriented person, it's going to be harder for you to be a teacher. Your students will work better and harder for you if they know they're not just an item on your to-do list."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have taught middle school PE &amp; Health for 6 years and I can honestly say this is my favorite age range. I have taught elementary and high school as well and there is just something special about middle school kids. They are just old enough that you can joke and be sarcastic but young enough that they are still kinda scared of you. Be firm to start, have your rules and consequences and stick to them. Once they know you aren't going to fold then you can start to let out the reigns a bit. Have fun, joke, be funny, be approachable, middle school is a huge transition time in these kid's lives and they are looking for someone to connect with. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Set your rules and expectations and stick to them. Middle schoolers are masters at acting like every punishment is the end of the world and you're a evil dictator and they are good at  laying on the guilt trip so you'll feel sorry for them and back off (they do it to their parents too). Example: ""Bobby you made a mess with your project and you were disruptive to your classmates instead of cleaning up your mess. You can't leave for your next class until it's all picked up""...typical middle school reaction to that ""Ah miss! I'm not the only one that made a mess they didn't clean up. Man! This isn't fair! I'm gonna be late to athletics now because you're making me stay (insert eye rolling and tongue clicking)"". Ignore their protests and calmly tell them what they need to get done or do to get out of trouble in most of the time my students drop the dramatics in a few minutes do their punishment and the next day they're all  smiles and act like it never happened. Just consider that the things that we say in our heads when we're annoyed or upset they're going to say out loud because they don't have that filter yet so don't take things they say personally. After a middle school tantrum (which really doesn't happen all that much if you have trained them in a routine) I'll usually talk to them about how they should have handled the situation. Some good reads on how to deal with teenagers are The First Days of School by Wong and Teach Like a Champion. I love middle schoolers they're funny, awkward, and really need a lot of attention and support to get through this difficult transition from child to teenager."
Middleschoolteachers,"Personally, I love middle schoolers. I did internships in college across all three ""levels"" and found myself most comfortable within middle school. 

That said, a lot of people thought I was crazy for majoring in - and then working in - middle school education. These kids are quirky, going through puberty, etc. I've found you either love it, or you hate it."
Middleschoolteachers,I teach middle school so I throw up some pictures from my life and talk for about 5-10 minutes and answer questions.  Kids love seeing pics.
Middleschoolteachers,"It depends how old they are...  For middle school and up, I'd tell them. They're going to know anyway (unless somehow you beat the first-year learning curve and already have incredible management and a wealth of tried and true strategies from years of subbing). I lied about it (gave student teaching experience as if real job) following the advice of my new coworkers who said ""they'll eat you alive."" They figured it out (or may have been told by one of the coworkers mid-year). Horrible horrible idea. Ruined what little rapport I had. I was quite novice and drowning all year; had I been honest with the students from the start, I might have at least had the ""rookie teacher show some compassion"" card and relationship-built from there... "
Middleschoolteachers,"I do not have any experience with this personally, however I did watch my mom do an online program to earn her credential. She had actually earned one in the early 90s but working in a private school for 8+ years with no professional development meant she had not kept up to date with changes and public schools would not hire her unless she completely went back to school. She did her program through http://www.calstateteach.net and had a good experience. She was working full time and I was in middle school so she was dealing with raising me as well. It wasn't easy but she survived. I would look around to see the requirements of the program. I think that if you were to lose your job they would be able to work with you, it wouldn't be like they would kick you out. My mom did substitute teaching, which I believe she was able to use that experience for coursework rather than student teaching. I wouldn't want to do a program like it if I had never taught before but I think it would be a good option for you."
Middleschoolteachers,"No, say ""I last taught physics at (student teaching) and middle school science at (student teaching)"""
Middleschoolteachers,MY first job was middle school aged kids in a group home(summer school). I was absolutely terrified. It turns out the biggest travesty was that I didn't get hired for the actual school year. Sometimes hearing bad things will make you realize how good you actually have it. Go in tough and soften up as the year goes by. Kids respond to structure and preparation is your best friend. 
Middleschoolteachers,"Our whole school uses Twitter to tweet to each other and parents. The middle school teachers use it with their students, and ask them to create a separate ""school"" twitter handle so no one sees anything they shouldn't. 

I really love using Twitter in the classroom. If your district requires you to provide evidence for professional responsibilities, you have it all documented on your Twitter page (you informed everyone of homework, trips, days off, links to enrichment in your city, all kinds of parent involevment,so much more). This is one reason our admin encouraged us to use Twitter. I signed up using my school email address and only use it to tweet school related stuff, and I've had no problems with privacy. Just make sure it's allowed by your admin and that you have signed permission if you choose to tweet out pictures or student work!"
Middleschoolteachers,"For me it's about 1-2%. 

Justin was a total sociopath who stole everything he could including his teacher's phone 3 times and 2 school laptops, never showed any contrition, just a shit-eating grin whenever anyone tried to discipline him. His mom was a meth addict. I never saw an ounce of sincerity with him, and I really really tried. Everything was a game, an act, a manipulation. He was pretty messed up.

Caleb was a really smart kid who wanted to learn, but it was physically impossible for him to not shout out really loud comments ALL THE TIME. It got to the point where I started to count how many interruptions he made (directed at the whole class), and the first time I counted, he interrupted me or his classmates 53 times in a 50 minute class period. If that's not *impossible*, I don't know what is.

Andres was a student who literally did no work, took no notes, and turned in no assignments for the entire year. I tried *every* tactic, nothing worked. He once took a 4-option multiple choice test with 60+ questions...and got an 8%—when random guesses should probabilistically give you a 25%.

There have been plenty of kids who I thought were hopeless, but I never gave up, to be honest mostly just to cover my ass, but then...it worked! Something changed, and that kid started to learn and/or participate. I've had kids like that thank me, saying ""Mr. infinitum17, thank you for never giving up on me.""

After a while, though, you can tell the kids who really are hopeless—their hopelessness is rooted in neurological abnormalities. If a kid is basically neurotypical, I don't believe that any such kid is impossible. And lots of non-neurotypical kids are reachable too, but all the ones that aren't seem to have very unfortunately wired brains.

EDIT: this is middle school"
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach AVID 6th - 8th and coordinate the program on my campus. First of all, let me just say that I love teaching AVID. I taught English for four years before taking on the AVID position, and I am so glad to be a part of the program. It is extremely rewarding, but certainly carries a heavier (and different) workload than being a regular classroom teacher. 

The fact that you've been to Summer Institute before will definitely make things easier for you. I would still recommend trying to get your hands on the AVID Elective Essentials or Strategies for Success or whatever the curriculum guide is called (if you need a copy, PM me and I can send you a pdf) to familiarize yourself with the curriculum. 

For me, the two things that I found most challenging when I started AVID were managing tutorials and becoming more of a mentor/counselor to my students. There are a lot of pieces to get right for tutorials- setting up procedures, training your tutors, making sure students are really pushing themselves and not just going through the motions. If you can, try to visit another AVID class on a tutorial day to observe how they do things. That really helped me see what to do and what not to do. 

It may be because I teach middle school, or because I get each cohort of AVID students for 3 years, but I have found that being an AVID teacher has made me become way more involved in my students' lives. This creates different challenges than I faced when teaching English. Many of my students see me as someone in between a teacher and a parent, so they come to me far more often than they did before for help, advice, or just someone to talk to. It's nice to know that they place such trust in me, but it can be emotionally exhausting. 

In spite of this, let me just reiterate: I love teaching AVID. The challenges of the job are far outweighed by its rewards. Let me know if you have more questions; I'd be happy to talk more!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught middle school from 2013-14, then I got called up to go play Army with my Reserve unit, which I've been doing since last fall.  I can still count on at least 2 or 3 school anxiety dreams a week, with no signs of slowing down.  Once you teach it's always a part of you..."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm a new teacher in one of the worst middle schools in Jacksonville, straight out of college. It. Is. So. Difficult. Your school/district/admin can make ALL the difference. Trust me, the differences are enormous. "
Middleschoolteachers,"High school is like the knuckle-breaker, I am going to guess. I have 0 teaching experience but in high school, people had the ""I wont need this, I wont learn this"" mentality. Try shadowing something other than high school as high school =/= middle school =/= elementary school "
Middleschoolteachers,I taught middle school math for 5 years
Middleschoolteachers,"They're 13-14 years old in middle school. I'm going to call the parents tomorrow. It's my only bad class, and part of it is because of the size of the class. I have a class of thirteen and I know their first and last names and can honestly tell you at least two good things about each student. In my class of 26 I'm so distracted by the troublesome students. It can't be like that anymore. I need to give my attention to the ones who are trying and want to be there. "
Middleschoolteachers,"For students that are going to be a challenge, I try to make a positive contact prior to contacting them with a problem. This has always worked to help the parents see that I am not just another teacher complaining about the child they love. Then, when I call or email for a problem, they may be more receptive. 

If the conversation is going to focus on a negative behavior, I would call the first time. You don't want to get in an email back and forth. I would stress that you are concerned about their child's learning and success I would also let them know that you will follow up soon. If you see any kind of improvement, email them immediately so that they know you are bring positive and do they can love on their child.

For the one that is causing the most trouble, you might have start documenting, talking to the administrators and counselors, and if you are in the US, start the RTI process. 

Good luck. I know it is frustrating. One of the teadins I like teaching middle school. I get a new class every 55 minutes or so.

Middleschoolteachers,"I have an incredibly similar situation, also in middle school. My student is many grade levels behind the other students, and has very limited social skills. His workload is significantly modified, yet it still results in near daily outbursts in class. He doesn't seem to really retain any of the information of class, even when given almost one on one assistance, to the point where other students are not getting the help they need/want. It feels like he is not really gaining much by being in class, and it's hard on the teachers as well.

Middleschoolteachers,"are you a male elementary teacher as well?

you raise an interesting point. However, it's not really one I considered to be a part of the problem... I've worked in schools in some form or another for the past 5 years. I've been a para at 2 middle schools for 2 years each, and a student teacher at a high school/a student teacher and TA at an elementary school for a year. In all of these cases I've got along with the staff fantastically, although there was always a pretty even balance of men and women. This is the first school I've been in where even the principal is a woman, so it feels very much like ""woman's territory""

Middleschoolteachers,"Just a followup, subbed at a Highschool on Friday. Was doing Spanish 1/2 (I know a fair amount of Spanish). Anywhere from 9th-12th grade. They were far more mature than the middle school kids, I wouldn't mind doing highschool, it's just middle school I think is where I run into issues. "
Middleschoolteachers,"You are not, nor will you likely ever be, your students' friend (of course they may become your friends when they are older, but probably not). You should be approachable and fair (and maybe nice sometimes), but you are in charge. A friend that is acts that way is an asshole.

A few teachers in my school go by Mr/s. Firstname or Mr/s. Nickname. We are pretty strict on the Mr/s. because we feel that learning to show respect to the people in charge (not blindly following, respect is different) is an important part of middle school and high school.

I will admit that I have personally always had an issue with the lack of formality that a lot of people have. Even when I was young it felt like adults were just trying to deny that they were actually experienced people (of course I still rebelled against their experience when I was young) when they asked to be called by their first name. (I am from New England, not the South)"
Middleschoolteachers,"First year male middle school teacher here. There are dudes in the building but my 8th grade team is all women. Thankfully two of them are close to me in age and we've bonded.

Middleschoolteachers,"We do - Algebra 1, Geometry, (Intermediate), Algebra II, Precalc.

I would guess around 75% of our students get through Precalc. Many gain a year on the front end by testing early into Algebra 1 in middle school. A few double up Algebra I and Geometry.

I haven't actually taught the Algebra II course (I teach most of our Geometry courses), but I will say that we do a lot of Trig in the second semester of Geometry."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was a sub for a year and a half. It's entirely up to you, but when I started subbing I made a list of subjects I felt comfortable *enough* subbing for. Most teachers assume that their sub may not have the total content knowledge that is needed to execute a master lesson.

I am certified in 6-12 English and 6-8 Math. Based on my personal skills and abilities, I took sub jobs in any middle school subject except French and Woodshop/""Tech Ed"", and I accepted high school jobs in English, Social Studies, Performing Arts and Home Ec. 

Now that I'm teaching full time, I design my lesson plans so that the sub gives an assignment and the kids work on it. As a sub, I never encountered a sub plan that actually asked me to execute a lesson; I don't ask my subs to pull off a full lesson plan. I subbed in areas I was comfortable in just so I could walk in knowing that I could *probably* answer questions during the lesson. But don't stress. You could accept a job in a subject you know zero things about and no one would likely know. 

Edit: a word"
Middleschoolteachers,"Don't give up. Things will get better. Just give it time. Learn to speak with a deeper voice, perfect that teacher glare, and show that you mean what you say. If you threaten consequences for bad behavior, follow through. Every time. Otherwise, they will take advantage of you. I am only 19. I weigh 92 pounds. And I am 4 ft 11. I sub in high school and middle school often and am working on my degree in education. Good luck, and remember: perfect that teacher glare!!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I guess it depends on where you live. My school caps at 25 and to me that's a huge class. I have a class of 19 this year, which is just about perfect. 

I'd much rather have fewer kids so I can give more individual attention. This is middle school level though, which is the hardest age to teach. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I've never taught 1st grade, but it sounds like a discipline issue to me. My kids (middle school) are not allowed to sit in non-learning postures or put their heads down. I tell them once to please sit up, and if they go back down, I calmly and quietly send them to the nurse if they're lying down or to the office if they're sitting in a reclining position. And don't worry if his mother is snarky--her kid is doing the wrong thing and she needs to either help you fix it or leave you alone to fix it your way."
Middleschoolteachers,"That's exactly what I have been trying to to: stay professional and kind in all things. The first few weeks were really hard, I felt like I was the the student back in middle school that everyone gossiped about and made fun of. These are teachers who have been teaching for 10+ years and it breaks my heart that they are unable to model the kindness we are supposed to be teaching our students. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I got my MAT before going into teaching (I had a BA in History but needed the certification and figured that if I was taking the classes to get certified, I might as well get my Masters and be paid more). I lost count of the number of people who told me districts wouldn't hire a new teacher with a Masters. Not sure how the rumor got started (perhaps some jaded people looking for a reason why they weren't hired) but in my experience, the people who do the hiring (principles, department heads, etc.) have absolutely no interest in trying to save money by hiring someone with less experience. It doesn't even factor into the equation. The Board of Ed is responsible for coming up with a budget. Now, if it was a very small district, with low resources, I could see it possibly making a difference, but the majority of district budgets are in the millions. The extra 2 k that they pay a teacher with a Masters is a drop in the bucket. They spend more in an hour than the extra salary they would have to pay you.

That being said, since you are already going to school for education (I'm assuming that your program is a certification based program), you might be better off finding a job first and letting the district pay for your continuing education. Also, a new teacher in English has very few opportunities of landing a high school job (job saturation). You might have to teach middle school for a few years first. I'm not saying it's impossible, more like improbable. If you have the right connection, you might very well end up in a high school. Best of luck!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Hi, thanks very much for your input.

The preparation that TFA provides is my biggest concern atm. I'm fairly confident in my ability to prepare and teach a subject....but like someone else on here said, there's more to teaching than that. 


I answered your first Q in another reply:
As far as being a new teacher goes, I'm a non-traditional student right now, I'll be 29 when I get my bachelor's. I had taken a few years off of studying to work, surprisingly, in academia (oh how I love the irony). Anyhow, I have several years of tutoring experience with elementary and middle school kids, and 2 years as an instructor w/ one of the big test-prep companies teaching LSAT and GMAT to college students and adults. It's some classroom management experience, although I know it's not the same as teaching, especially not in one of the poorer performing districts. And yes, ideally I would teach high school but I wouldn't mind having a middle school classroom.

As far as disadvantaged youths- I had a few as tutoring students, and I would say they struggled far more than their peers, even in basic language skills. It always took more work on my part to understand the particular motivation and needs of an underprivileged kid and they tended to require more support and guidance from me. So, it's tougher over all.

I guess my question to you, then, is how do your TFA colleagues compare to your traditional-teacher colleagues when it comes to that first year in the classroom? Are all first year teachers equally idealistic and unprepared, or do you feel that TFA does a better/worse job in this aspect?

"
Middleschoolteachers,"I am currently the math teacher at a small private middle school but before that I subbed at middle schools exclusively. I was about 22 or 23 when I started as well and I was concerned that I wouldn't be taken seriously as an authority figure. My advice would be that when a student has crossed that line between a verbal warning and just being sent out of the class you should talk to them one on one, from experience they will stop trying to show off and do what you tell them. Does not work 100% of the time but much better results than escalating something trivial by making them look foolish by yelling or scolding them infront of their peers."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade, and I am always sad when I hear about subs that won't sub for middle school.  The kids are actually pretty great most of the time!

The first thing you need to be a successful sub at the middle school level is good sub plans.  Unfortunately, that's not in your control.  Hopefully the teacher leaves clear plans that will keep the students occupied the entire period.  If students have any extra time after finishing work, that will lead to problems.  You might want to have a supplemental activity ready to go if the lesson plans the teacher left don't take the entire period.  Nothing with homework, but something to keep them occupied.

You can't be their friend.  You need to be structured and firm.  When subs try to be ""cool"", it is always disastrous.  One of my colleagues had a sub once who let the students listen to music on their phones.  Without headphones.  During a test.  Nevermind that it was against school rules and ended up being a huge distraction to other kids trying to focus on their tests.  If you aren't sure of the rules, err on the side of being a buzzkill.

You said you have been leaving detailed notes for the teacher, which is great.  If it's minor problems, that's adequate.  The teacher will follow up with those students when the get back, presumably.  But if any student causes major problems, deal with it immediately.  Send them to the office, or write them up, or whatever options are available at that school.  If it's a major problem, it shouldn't be allowed to continue to disrupt the class. When the teacher gets back, it's hard to know exactly what happened and assign consequences.  As a sub, you don't know the kids well enough or have enough of a relationship for ""talking to them"" about the problem to have much effect.  You need actions to back it up.

As a young sub, you should try to emphasize your position as an authority figure by dressing very professionally and acting mature.  Don't try to get any street cred by acting young, it will undermine your authority.

Anecdotally, my students seem to hate subs that talk too much about themselves, their experiences, and things other than the lesson.  Take that as you will.

This is all just my opinion, but maybe you'll find it helpful!

   "
Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks for the feedback, it's great to hear from a TFA alum. And thanks especially for those book recommendations. I hear you about how difficult it would be, and that seems to be the consensus on here. 

As far as being a new teacher goes, I'm a non-traditional student right now, I'll be 29 when I get my bachelor's. I had taken a few years off of studying to work, surprisingly, in academia (oh how I love the irony). Anyhow, I have several years of tutoring experience with elementary and middle school kids, and 2 years as an instructor w/ one of the big test-prep companies teaching LSAT and GMAT to college students and adults.  It's some classroom management experience, although I know it's not the same as teaching, especially not in one of the poorer performing districts. And yes, ideally I would teach high school but I wouldn't mind having a middle school classroom.

Given this, do you think that the TFA training will still be sub-par in terms of preparing me for a classroom? I would hate to think that I was being useful but actually end up harming my students :/ Also, could you elaborate on what the biggest problems you faced with your students were? Is it motivation or behavioral or both?

Edit to add: thank you for being comprehensive in your reply!"
Middleschoolteachers,"**tl;dr: Getting into the classroom with TFA immediately after receiving your BA might be good for you from a professional standpoint, but it probably won't be good for your students or good for you mentally and physically.**

This advice comes from a TFA alum who graduated with her BA, took three years to teach in a few different kinds of classrooms, then joined TFA. 

There is no quick or easy way to explain something this complicated. As another commenter pointed out, corps members (CMs from here on) have very diverse experiences. Based on the things you've said, however, I can give you some rudimentary feedback.

**""My main reasons are that TFA would get me in a classroom immediately...""**

* If you want to be a teacher, being in a classroom is a good thing. That said, you also mentioned that you may want to be an administrator, so I think you might first clarify your goals to make a better decision here. 
* If you are sure you want to be a teacher, then consider the following: TFA isn't going to put you in an average classroom with average challenges. TFA will do its best to put you in an extremely difficult classroom with very serious challenges. You will be facing situations that even veteran teachers would struggle with, and you will be facing those situations with almost no experience and very limited support. Being well-versed in your subject matter is the least of your concerns: the majority of your students will come into your classroom several grade-levels behind and you will face challenging behaviors that you may never have expected. 
* Given this situation--and here I address my biggest beef with TFA--how can you be expected to be even a moderately successful teacher? TFA's guiding principle in this issue seems to be that if you just try hard enough, you can create positive change for your students. They're right in a certain light: consider moving a heavy, unwieldy object. It might be extraordinarily difficult to move that object by yourself, but it is possible with enough effort. But what if you had appropriate tools, like a dolly cart? It might still be heavy and present certain challenges, but it would be much less strain on you. Apply that to teaching. You've got a very difficult situation, and you can either struggle in brave ignorance or you can work more efficiently with good tools (i.e., pedagogical training, scaffolded teaching experience, appropriate resources, coaching from a mentor teacher, etc.).

**""I am eager to have more hands-on experience teaching...""**
* There are so many ways that you could get this experience that wouldn't involve you taking full responsibility for the academic welfare of children who are at risk of failure in school or worse. Having those kinds of stakes as a new teacher leads to extreme stress which can then translate into burnout. 

**""I could possibly get some grants/scholarships through my involvement that would pay for (most of) my Masters""**
This is true: Your membership in TFA will entitle you to an Americorps scholarship, and TFA has special relationships with several universities that will give you a discounted rate on top of that. However, there are a lot of other ways to get scholarships. 

**""I know I'm in for a challenging 2 years...""**
* Yes. More than you expect. I have never met a CM who didn't feel at some point or another that he or she wanted to quit. 

**""Ideally I want to teach ELA and history for High School students""**
That position is so idealized that a very large portion of candidates for TFA will also ask for the same assignment. Your competition would be stiff, and--depending on your region--you would probably be more likely to be assigned to something like middle school, which few CMs ask for, but many receive. 
 
**""and maybe work my way into administration after getting a Masters.""**
If you want to be an administrator, it's helpful to have a teaching background, but I am concerned about the prospect that one might teach for a few years just as a pathway into administration. Almost no one--TFA or not--will be a very strong teacher until 3 years into teaching. If you plan to stick around in teaching for just a few years, you're just setting your students up for the next new teacher who will come in to replace you, struggle in his/her job for a few years, and then, often, leave the profession. Repeat ad nauseam. 

Also, if you haven't had previous experience working full-time for extended periods, it will come as a big shock to you to suddenly be putting in 60-80 hour weeks. 

Loooooong story short, my recommendation would be for you to seek out some teaching experience elsewhere (hell, do what I did and teach English abroad for a year) in a situation that is less dire and high-stakes than the one into which TFA would put you. Get Doug Lemov's *Teach Like a Champion* and study it. If you want to teach English, also get Jim Burke's *The English Teacher's Companion.* Learn some stuff, then, when you're feeling good and ready to tackle perhaps the greatest social justice issue of our time, apply to TFA. "
Middleschoolteachers,"My school in the Southern U.S. has 7 period days (middle school). I teach 6 periods and get one period for preps (2 times a week we have meetings during this now, but that's under union dispute so we'll see). Teachers arrive 1 hour before the kids, and the kids are there for 6.5 hours. Students and teachers get a 22-25 minute lunch, depending on how you view passing time vs. lunchtime. There are 4 minutes between classes. 

Students don't get breaks, unless you count passing time, which depending on where you're going, you may need to get to class. More and more classes are becoming academic - they take notes and stuff half the time in PE instead of playing. And if you fail the state tests, you lose your electives. 

Basically, the student who's passed the state test has 4 core classes and 3 electives (with PE being mandated unless you have a parental waiver or a supplemental class - meaning you failed the state test). Then, if you failed Math, you get an extra math class. If you failed Reading, you get an extra Reading class. If you failed both, and are not excluded by another test, you get an extra Study Skills/Test Prep course. At my Title 1 middle school, 75% have at least one extra class, and 30% this year have all 3 filled in. 

If you have even one extra class, you might not get a PE. Even when the kids have PE, they don't get any free time. No courses are allowed to give unstructured time to students and even the ability to give student choice is restricted as everything must follow the Learning Goal.

Breaks in school aren't a part of American culture these days. There is a lot of restriction compared to even when I was in school in the 90s. 

As to school start times, here it's 9:30 for Middle, 7:30 for HS (teachers arrive 15 minutes before kids and stay an hour after), and 8:30 for Elementary (teachers arrive a half hour before kids and stay a half hour after). "
Middleschoolteachers,"That's how it was when I was in elementary and middle school. But, as I got older it became just another school day. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I am responding to your updated cover letter.

Point 1: No contractions in formal letters like this, e.g. I've, don't, shouldn't.  Spell it out.  Yes, it varies per district and person, but spelling out the entire contraction never got any eyebrow raises than someone who used a contraction.

Point 2: Put your name and contact information in the header above the district's address, similar to how you have it in your resume.  If not that (which I recommend), put your contact information (email, number) at the end.  Make this process as easy for them as possible.  Flipping pages is a pain when you're doing it 500 times.

Point 3: (Trying not to offend the poster who said this but...) NO TO THE PHOTO SUGGESTION.  Please, for the love of teaching, do not do this.  It'll make you stand out for all the wrong reasons.  They can easily discriminate based off of appearance if you do this as well.  It's the same reason why you do not include your age or birth date on a resume.  Why can Dan Meyer get away with it?  Because he's Dan Meyer. 

Point 4: No generic cover letters.  Your revisions don't indicate that you have a spot where you are going to talk about the district or school's mission statement or beliefs.  Do not send out the same cover letter to different schools.  You can have a slot where you will change the wording; there's a high chance that most districts have similar statements anyway.

I'll be brutally honest: The issue with your cover letter is that it's all just a lot of fluff.  You literally have not told me anything unique about yourself that sets you apart from others.   This varies QUITE a bit with districts, but if I was reading a cover letter with a bunch of quotes and quasi-analyses of said quotes, I would be thinking, ""This person has absolutely nothing substantial to say."" If you feel the need to explicitly tell me how you feel and not what you did, you either do not have anything important to say (which obviously is not true based on your resume) or have no idea how to say it.

I mean, you love working with kids?  That's really nothing new. Every teacher you're up against does -- or will damn pretend it at the least.  You're going to help students with technology?  Well, duh.  That's the way education is going.  You HAVE to do that anyway.  What TYPE of technology are you going to implement that will benefit the district and its students? 

&gt; Just like anything in life, a good support is needed in order to succeed.  Education is one of the biggest building blocks to life.  Students now no longer just understand the material but also get excited to learn.

You told me nothing to make me believe that you are capable of doing this.  If you tell me WHAT you did to make students feel excited to learn, then everything you said above is implied.  Hell, you wouldn't even NEED the above quote.  I, your reader, would know by implication.

&gt; Your cover letter needs to hook them so they hopefully look at your resume (and this is if you've made it past their online application filter process). Talking about what is already on your resume doesn't do this.

I noticed you took out most of the information on your resume in your cover letter because of this comment, but you are misunderstanding what this poster meant.  Your resume covers the basics of what you did to prepare yourself; your cover letter is used to expand on a particular set of incidents that will demonstrate to future employees why you are going to be a benefit.  For example, my resume may state that I have worked in a middle school for x amount of years and helped pilot the 1-to-1 iPad implementation in my school, but my cover letter says that my students did a project in order to prepare them for the upcoming SBAC and state-wide tests that use iPads and computers.  I told them that I was asked quite a bit to demonstrate iPad applications at staff meetings.  I told them that having a teacher who is comfortable with iPads is beneficial because their students will need to be comfortable with technology anyway when they head to university or trade school or employment after high school.  You need more concrete, real views and ideas in your cover letter.  What you are saying you are going to do is much, much harder to prove.

While you do not need to follow this formula, perhaps this will frame your thinking a bit more:

* Par 1: The position you are interested in, a comment about the school's mission statement (I noticed with _____ that your district values ...) and why your experiences match those values. Pick one value or quality you have yourself (use of technology, etc.) and have that as your focal point to guide the rest of your letter.

* Par 2-3: Preparation.  What did you do to match this value the school holds highly?  How is what you did going to actually benefit the school and its students whether presently or in the near future?

* Par 4: A bit on your philosophy or what you see your students doing or what they are capable of (the answer to this is capable of anything so long as they have clear and high expectations).  How will your teaching philosophy benefit your students and the world they will be living in?

* Par 5: Wrap up.  Repeat what position you are interested in and your contact information."
Middleschoolteachers,"I can fill you in on what floirda does. In most schools here, students have 6 hour days and teachers have 7.5 hour days.  I'm working in special ed at a title 1 school (very low socioeconomic) and I have a an hour planning period in the morning, 30 minute lunch break, and an hour break at the end of the day while the students are at specials. Most middle schools and high schools have 6 periods (4 core and 2 elective)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Just the other day, I was ready to throw in the towel and quit teaching. This is my third year and I am a new mother so everything has been hitting me much harder this year. After going over the bellringer in one of my freshmen algebra classes, one of my students said, ""I feel like I learn so much in your class."" Another student followed with, ""Yeah, I try my hardest in this class because we do so much in here and I always want to learn more."" Yet another student agreed, ""I can tell you care and it makes me care, too. You have taught me more math this year than I learned in all of middle school."" Other students continued agreeing and my eyes filled with tears. It was like they knew I needed to hear it.

I fully believe this was God's way of telling me that I am EXACTLY where He needs me."
Middleschoolteachers,I teach middle school math. I use Pandora and play a station called Classical Music for Studying. I play it softly during independent work. 
Middleschoolteachers,"You might also consider teaching middle school. I got my credential in Social Studies and then passed the test to get English authorization. I teach a block period of US history and English to 8th graders. 

That being said, I LOVE LOVE LOVE my middle school students. Sure, it's stressful, there are rough days, and it can be a thankless job sometimes. But the benefits I've encounter far outweigh all that. The first few years will be rough, but once you get in a groove, it will be great."
Middleschoolteachers,"With the advent of Vine, we make students trade their phones for the restroom pass during the school day.  Too many middle schoolers were taking inappropriate videos in the potty.

Of course, we also had 3 boys in trouble for smoking Twix in the bathrooms, so not sure if technology is completely to blame!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school science, and I use Pandora a lot.  There is a setting you can select to not play any explicit lyrics.  I have used a ""Classical for Studying"" station during tests, John Williams station, Lindsey Stirling, or 2 Cellos  (those two often play string covers of pop/rock songs) stations during worktime.  It's instrumental, so they don't get too distracted, but upbeat enough and occasionally familiar enough that they like it.  "
Middleschoolteachers,"I hardly crack open the book. They are all on a shelf and are used mostly with subs. I teach middle school language arts. We have an anthology that is mostly fiction. We teach themes aligned to the standards , so we pull resources from many, many places and disciplines. Our book is not aligned with what we do. Disclaimer--our kids have a separate reading teacher.

Middleschoolteachers,"School supply retail manager here!  Please allow my $0.02 USD ($1.51 CAD)

If you don't want to pay more than fifty bucks but need an electric, I recommend the [Bostitch XACTO series](http://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-Teacher-Electric-Sharpener-SmartStop/dp/B001PMG98O/ref=pd_sim_op_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1Q7AVA00VJ834555KT3X). The great thing about it is that it has a blue light that comes on when the pencil is adequately sharpened. Great for middle schoolers who know someone's going to watch them sharpen the pencil and go ""OOOH IT'S BLUE AND YOU DIDN'T STOP"" if they don't pay attention. The downside to it is that you have to be very conscious about shaving piling up. The motor can jam very easily if shavings get in there. For the price, it's pretty solid.

If you want the sharpener to end all sharpeners, go with the [Bostitch MPS1](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-Bostitch-MPS1BLK-Antimicrobial-Sharpener/dp/B004E2OALA/ref=sr_1_3?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412907248&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=pencil+sharpener). *""But a manual?!""* I hear you cry... yes, a manual. It needs emptying once a day but holy god, does it sharpen like a beast. In the retail business the best feedback we get is when people return things. In other words, if it doesn't get returned it's good. I'm looking at my inventory program right now and we've had exactly 1 returned since we started carrying them back in 2008. **We've sold 151.** Seriously, that's un-fucking-heard-of. It's also 18 bucks on Amazon, so grab that sucker right now.

Feel free to respond or PM me with any questions. I'd be happy to share my (limited) insight.

*EDIT: grammar ^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^an ^^^English ^^^teacher, ^^^dammit*"
Middleschoolteachers,"Yup. It's a gang thing; that's why we have a no hat policy at my middle school.

It's also just annoying. Seriously. The kids who collect baseball caps and try to trade them and fuss at them (it's stupid because at my campus you can bring hats but not wear them), meh. And also some kids try to cover their faces to sleep or whatever. 

There's no positive result of wearing a hat. It never encourages positive behavior. It encourages non-academic behavior, as hats remind the kids not of other serious places (like church where they'd never ever try to wear a baseball cap) but of places where they chill or hang out. School is not a hang out; having rules that set that tone are good in my book. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Student taught and have done most of my subbing in high schools. The kinds of high schools in which mild swearing is common place. ""Ass"" is perfectly normal and commonplace. ""Shit"" is contextually tolerated, and ""Fuck"" is not allowed.

First time in a middle school the kids were grilling me on what kind of cool things I could do with chemistry, so of course I say I know how to make TNT and I draw what the molecule looks like on the board real quick and there like ""ooooooh"" and ""ahhhhh"" and I just off the cuff say ""Yup, I'm a bit of a bad ass."" and the look of shock on their faces was just priceless."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach 7th grade, and it's our students' first year of middle school. Their school pictures aren't uploaded to our online grade book until about week 9. The picture method is my favorite because I can ""practice"" at home. I know other teachers who take a picture of each kid at the beginning of the year for their seating chart. Or, with a seating chart with just names I try to remember their faces. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach 400+ students a year. I take attendance while students complete a 10-15 minute Warm Up. I go around and ask how each student is, I use their name, I quickly check in with them, inquire if they were absent last class, etc. I let students know that this is how I take attendance at least until I memorize everyones names and usually a few weeks later. If I skip this process or get distracted and miss someone, they get offended. Ohhh middle school. But THIS WORKS for me and helps me memorize names to faces. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Do you have them line up? I have all my classes (middle school) line up in the room before going to their next class. I dismiss the girls line and then the boys line (or the other way around, depending) and watch them all leave. Then since I'm ICT I usually walk them to their next class at the end of the line.  "
Middleschoolteachers,The thing is unless you deal with math as an adult and teach it to others it is difficult to come up with this on your own. If my kids knew how to build the elementary math it would make middle school and high school math so much easier for them.
Middleschoolteachers,"As a high school math teacher I love the common core. In elementary I know it is harder to teach this way because you have so many other things to prepare for your day (I admire you so much). However, when they get to me they have no foundation and they don't understand why they are subtracting 9 on both sides of the equation. It benefits everybody if we stop with the ""rules"" and ""magic math"" and teach real math... They desperately need to know the why. I refuse to give my kids rules to do the math, they would be memorizing all day everyday. 

Please, if you need help with how to teach math conceptually ask a high school teacher or a middle school teacher with a strong math background. It can only help."
Middleschoolteachers,"You would think that...But he actually doesn't LOOK albino at all. I was really surprised to learn that he was! Aside from the telltale eye color if you look close, he has very normal skin and hair tone. He also wears glasses that make it difficult to see his true eye color. I would say the only kids who are aware are those who know him from middle school. "
Middleschoolteachers,"So here it is from an elementary/middle school math teacher:
This is exactly how I would solve that math problem in my head.  The ""count up"" method is solid.
BUT...
I learned the traditional algorithm first and figured out the ""count up"" method on my own.  Now I am invested in the ""count up"" method, and because I discovered it on my own it has become that much more meaningful."
Middleschoolteachers,"I modify my seating according to the lesson/activity. Typically, they are in groups but they all face the board. But if we have a group-work day, I'll have my last class arrange the desks to face each other before that day. After the group-work day, the last class changes it back. This saves a lot of time and trouble rearranging desks every period.

I also found that many middle school kids prefer to talk to each other shoulder-to-shoulder than face-to-face. Must be that awkward stage, ha!
"
Middleschoolteachers,"I agree with breaking down steps and creating roles. 

Also, if a particular group is having an issue or a particular student is not participating, I always include in my write up of the project that off task behaviors can result in individuals being assigned an alternate project to complete on their own. 

The few times that I've had to do that, the student learns that it really isn't worth it and for the next project shows improvement in working with the others.

I'd break down and time. We have five minutes to assign roles and collect materials. Now we have ten minutes to gather contact and write our title on the project. Now we have ten minutes to find pictures and begin putting information on our poster.  

I do this in middle school. Small deadlines help, especially in the beginning. 

Good luck!"
Middleschoolteachers,"As with salary, it's amazing how much workload can vary across districts and even school sites.

In my area the high schools are very well supported by bonds and other local funding, so they have reduced class sizes and fewer classes.  A large number of students also attend private high schools, leaving fewer students to serve.

The elementary school district has repeatedly been denied by the voters, and the board has prioritized elementary school spending over middle school.  Consequently the middle schools in our district are severely overcrowded, making it harder and harder to find and keep single-subject teachers."
Middleschoolteachers,"Wow, reduced work load for high school? I'm a high school teacher and I'm actually going to talk to my administration about the insane work load I have. I'm teaching 3,subjects I've never taught. My middle school friends are sitting pretty with earlier release times and half the grading."
Middleschoolteachers,"Yeah, OP is going to have to do their own research, as this is going to vary heavily on where you are located.  In my area (densely populated Northern California) high schools are pretty much never part of the elementary school district.  They have their own districts and their own income streams, so high school teachers are almost always paid 10-20% more than middle and elementary teachers.  We have a big problem with middle school teachers jumping ship to the high school for the bigger paychecks and reduced workload.

In my area you google '(District Name) Salary Schedule' to see the breakdown of how much you get paid per education level and years of experience."
Middleschoolteachers,"It just bugs was a joke. See? The previous comment was from lady_bug1. Looks like you need a sense of humor. Thanks for your excuse about why you cannot express yourself. Reminds me of middle school.

Middleschoolteachers,"If I were an elementary or middle school teacher, perhaps I would feel differently. However, even after reading that article, I still would not allow it in my high school science and calculus classes."
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, it's going away. No, it's not necessary. Most of my kids can't write in cursive (8th grade). Right before Christmas or at the end of the year, sometimes I teach them for fun if they've earned a treat (since they weren't required to learn it, they actually think writing in cursive is fun - the little weirdos). They're always terrible at it, but they learn to refine their signatures. It's funny. Since kids don't use the dictionary, sometimes my ""treat"" day is a dictionary game too or a chance to find weird words (I teach struggling readers at a tough Title 1 middle school so I did not come up with this or cursive as a fun thing, I had no idea they'd want to do these things; all student suggested - but kids are weird). I guess this is similar to the way one teacher let us use a few old typewriters (maybe like 5 for the class) when I was in Junior High and I still remember it being really fun. 

Basically, cursive is a typewriter or an abacus. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle in a middle school in Canada. I have 3 different French classes and I teach science and humanities to 2 different classes. 

I have between 80 and 90 kids that I teach in total. 

"
Middleschoolteachers,I LOVE this and I teach middle school!
Middleschoolteachers,"28 in a month, and I look 14. I'm pretty short, and my 4th graders are my height or just a bit smaller. It's hard to locate me among students, no matter how I dress. It's all about how you manage, and not how you look.

I'm switching positions soon and I'll be traveling between two schools during the week. I've already considered getting polos done in particular colors so that staff might at least recognize me as staff and not a student (one of my schools will be a middle school)."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was your age when I started teaching secondary (younger, I taught elementary overseas) but in a similar situation (except female). I'm in my 30s now, and kids and parents still ask - even though I've been at the same school for awhile - if it's my first year teaching sometimes because I look so young. Just got that from the few parents who came to parent-teacher night and my 6th pd. class (one of whom I taught last year and who set them straight for me). 

I don't think it hindered me or would hinder you. I don't even always dress up (though first year, that's a good tip anyway, just for the confidence level and extra boost since you're learning management). I dress kind of cute and weird (a lot of my clothes are from Japan - leggings and poofy skirts and all kinds of weird, young-ish things, because I like them; not a lot of Ann Taylor for me, and I also wear jeans and such sometimes too). 

I work at a tough school (Title 1 middle school, 8th grade, lots of ESE/ESOL, gangs in the area, rough kids), and my management is excellent now - some of that's practice, but it only really took me a year to get it down pat, and everyone has a rough first year if they teach in the kind of schools and positions I'm used to. Management is really WAY less about appearance than people think. I've taught HS too - 8th and 11th are my main experience levels, though I've touched on 7th, 9th, 3rd, and Kindergarten. Even though I teach 8th now, there are so many kids that are behind at my school, I teach lots of 15 and 16 year olds too. 

I have a new colleague who's in her late 40s with little teaching experience and none at schools like mine before this year; she's very dressy, much more so than me, and always looks put together. She looks like a businesswoman; I look like a young bohemian. Her management is a joke. Kids literally threw away textbooks in her room, they curse at her and each other, they walk out, they don't do work, they don't listen - even sometimes our good Advanced kids. She's pulling her hair out. (People are trying to help her, we're not trying to let her drown, but she just can't relate to the kids.) Lately, they're changing schedules, and I get kids from her room that really push it too far and get kicked out, and they do everything I ask most of the time. Looking or being older or dressing professionally isn't going to really impact management with any of the kids you actually need management with.

Appearance matters a lot more with parents and colleagues than with the kids, and then it's more about presentation (how you dress) than your age. Management is about 1) relationships, 2) consistency, 3) communication, 4) controlling your own emotions, 5) organization, and 6) projecting confidence. 

If you have good experience relating to kids, that's a great start. The last thing I'd worry about is how you look. Kids really care about lots of things way more than that. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I have it pretty good. I teach 2 preps (3 last year) and have 85 (90) students. My friend teaches 3 preps, 175 students at a middle school, I have another friend at a public high school who teaches 2 preps and 145 students. I've heard of this being a problem elsewhere too. I'd say it's a general issue with public schools in general. I know I feel super overwhelmed grading 56 Algebra 1 tests and it can take me upwards of 3 or 4 hours to do so. I can't even imagine if that number were tripled. I wouldn't have any time to teach!

Edit: Grammar."
Middleschoolteachers,"Sometimes I ask the counselor to pull kids. 

When I was teaching middle school, I had the kids RIGHT after PE. One or two kids were the worst smelling. So bad it would make your eyes water. One day when the WHOLE group came in, I cracked a joke about needing to open a window. They laughed, and I had an opportunity to talk about body and deodorant to the whole group, rather than single anyone out. 

I really did open a window. Those kids were funky.
"
Middleschoolteachers,"""Not very kind"" is not acceptable. I work at a middle school and our nurse is awesome about.  Growing up is so confusing, having a nurse that doesn't know how to educate children while preserving their dignity... sounds like someone needs a talking/training and/or a new job. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm in Oklahoma, which is pretty conservative, and I have BRIGHT red hair (clearly not natural) and many visible tattoos. This is how I looked during my internship and they hired me, so it didn't hurt my reputation at all.

 I teach in a middle school in a major city in OK and there are quite a few teachers with tattoos, nose piercings, and weird hair, even some blue and purple. I would just ask about the teacher handbook and see if there are any clear rules about dress and hair. I personally don't think you need to change your hair at all!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Ask your cooperating teacher for help. It's insane that they're making you teach all AP courses, but you can still do it. If your cooperating teacher isn't helping you, go to your college adviser for help. I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm a middle school science teacher, so if you need help with keeping 12 year-olds interested, let me know.

Chances are that your cooperating teacher is waiting for you to ask for help. That's kind of a dick move, but some cooperating teachers are assholes. He or she has probably taught this class before. They know what to do to keep the kids interested. Good luck."
Middleschoolteachers,"There can be a BIG difference between HS and CC students.  You could get a HS class full of freshmen with IEPs and you are basically teaching middle school.

There is more job security in HS than CC.  CC's are all going towards using adjuncts.  Getting a full-time job is not easy.  You would need at least a Masters in Bio to teach at the CC level..."
Middleschoolteachers,"Absolutely. I used this last year with great success. Piggybacked on a PTO grant with the middle school social studies teacher, who used it to have his class recreate ancient Rome."
Middleschoolteachers,I'm teaching French in middle school and this website has provided me with a ton of great resources: http://knightlife.paceacademy.org/srajimenez/
Middleschoolteachers,"Since always, it's probably just more explicit now. You've probably seen stuff like 5 + 6 =11 then a problem like 6 +_ = 11 so they can learn fact families. That's probably a little lower of an example for 3rd grade, but algebra can be done at any grade. At least when they get to middle school, it won't be such a shock. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I don't know why you're getting so much flak for what you said. The idea that a student would openly masturbate in class is insane to me. And I'm a middle school teacher.  Written into his ilp or not, I don't see any way this is happening. The student would be removed for doing that. "
Middleschoolteachers,"You could always go outside the classroom for a game. With my first graders I would do math exercise. I would give them 3+4 jumping jacks and wait for them all to give me a thumbs up and then, as a class, tell me the answer. I think a way to modify this to middle school level is to have two bowls(or hats or just something to hold bits of paper). One for math equations and one for exercises. So in the bowl for math equations you can have the kids even make up appropriate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division problems with a answer less than 100 let's say. But also instruct them not to write the answer on the paper. Then on another paper you or they or even you as a class, can think of exercises. Then you can take them outside, tell them to spread out and start the game. Have them go up one by one taking a slip of paper and an exercise. Then, they solve the equation and play gym teacher with the class. "
Middleschoolteachers,"When I was at the middle school I gave a mix with this song on it to a teacher, they seemed to really like it

Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks so much for starting this thread.  We just went one to one at our school this year, and this is hugely helpful!  So far, I've really loved [Socrative](http://socrative.com/), both for graded formatives and for teacher directed checks for understanding. 

And maybe it's obvious, but Google Forms is amazing.  [Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GOO0lZkERzXKUE13wA7hSYS6etpEY0KKi6p7NI7Qm7U/viewform?edit_requested=true) of an extension activity I made for my students this week.  Students who finished early could work on it independently.  I have a lot of fast (and slow) finishers, so this was great!

I did have a question about Kahoot because it seems like it has great potential.  I worry about the student ranking.  Is there ever any stigma or embarrassment for students who are ranked last / close to last?  It seems like a very public failure for some of my sensitive middle schoolers.  Has anyone had issues with that?"
Middleschoolteachers,"YES. Use what other people have made - don't reinvent the wheel! [Betterlesson](www.betterlesson.com) is common core aligned and is pretty great for HS, maybe it's good for middle school too."
Middleschoolteachers,"Almost none of my colleagues got Social Studies jobs in high school when we finished - a bunch did middle school, several were out of subject area - one got a special education position, e.g. Now, maybe four years out, more people have managed to move into subject area and/or grade level. 

If the only thing you're willing to teach in terms of age group and subject is high school Social Studies, and you don't want to spend time in middle school or doing English, then you may have a hard time getting the position you want. Plus, in California, Social Studies is fairly broadly defined: history, ancient to modern, world and US, psychology, geography, civics, economics and ethnic studies. With high school social studies, you have no guarantee that you won't get a subject that you're not very familiar with. When I did my student teaching, I almost got economics, which I really didn't want. LAUSD has passed something recently to push towards ethnic studies mandatory for high school graduation. 

If you eventually want to teach college, think really carefully about whether you want to do academia and research - because AFAIK that is what will determine if a four year school will hire you. Are you doing cutting edge research and writing grants and making them money? And if the answer is no, you just want to teach older students, Social Sciences at junior colleges are filled with PhDs who didn't make it in academia. Many of them these days don't have tenure and are stuck teaching at multiple schools without benefits as adjuncts. "
Middleschoolteachers,"""Pull out"" is a command we use in band classrooms from the very first band class in middle school. It means to pull out a part of the tubing slightly (tuning slide), because all of your notes are too high. Kids learn the sexual meaning later on, and we ride ride it out. Damn near everything in band is a sex joke (tounge harder, grip lower, gentle fingers, moisten lips, no teeth), so this stuff is always just under the surface for the dirty minded kids/teachers.

I had paused a rehearsal to correct some tuning. Discovered all of the sousaphones had their tuning slides pushed all of the way in. I said ""Playing loud on Sousaphone tends to make it go sharp, so when in doubt.......use a longer tuning sli--"" 

During that pause, all of the brass players completed the original sentence in their heads. When they could smell my fear, and sense my retreat to other words, they attacked. As one, my brass boys and girls all shouted ""WHEN IN DOUBT PULL OUT!"""
Middleschoolteachers,"When I was a student teacher, teaching at a middle school. We had a rainy day schedule, which means all PE classes are in the gym. So about 130 students sitting in a gym, the teachers would usually say ""mouths shut, eyes on me!"" To get the attention of a large group. When it was my period to lead the students I tried to copy their saying but instead said, ""eyes shut, mouths on me!"" As soon as I said it, I realized what I did. Most students didn't  notice but a few did. And the other teachers where rolling on the floor laughing hysterically. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I had a very similar moment. I teach middle school orchestra, and we were working on playing scales in tune. I usually have my bass players hold the first note of the scale while everyone else matches pitch to them. So, when we were working on D Major, I turned to bass section (three 8th grade boys) and said ""Alright basses, give us the D."" "
Middleschoolteachers,"&gt;I've been in my union for 3 years. I originally joined for job protection, just in case. Last year, my union president transferred from the elementary school to teach at the middle school. From what I've heard from other teachers, she had an issue with the special education teacher at the elementary school so she came to the middle school with a vendetta against me, the special education teacher. I was never anything but kind and accommodating to her. If she asked me to do something, I would do it. When she insisted that I create activities for her lowest RTI group, I did it, even though she never once did any of the planned activities. When she wanted me or the special ed assistant to cover her class so she could run errands, we did.

If this is true, why?  Why did you cover for her?  Why did you never say anything to her?

&gt;I later learned that she documented anything she perceived that I was doing wrong. 

How did you learn this information?

&gt;My principal called me to her office one day and said I was being written up. The union president was present. Her reasons for the write up were a list of things the teacher felt I was doing wrong. ""You were 11 minutes late on [such date] getting to her classroom."" God forbid, I had to use the restroom that day. (The IEPs at my school are written in a way that is against normal policies. Every single minute of my day was put into IEPs, saying that I needed to be in certain classrooms for the entire length of the periods. In reality, there weren't even enough minutes in a work day to actually follow the IEPS.) It was a list of similar complaints. Then, my principal said, ""This is your third write up."" I replied, ""Uh, no, this is only the second."" She then said, ""Actually, I never told you about the second one. But I'll need you to go ahead and sign both of them now."" I thought I had no other option, seeing as how my union ""rep"" was present but hadn't defended me. 

Regardless of anything else, you stop the meeting.  You have the right to choose your own representation.  The administration may have gone to the President because they were available, however if they are the ones bringing these accusations up it is a clear conflict of interest.  Find someone else, someone you trust, to bring in to that meeting.

&gt;I talked to a few other teachers afterwards and they agreed that my union rep wasn't there to defend me, she was there to condemn me.

Which is why you need to stress that you should have had other representation there.

&gt;This year, I decided to quit the union. I'm a little nervous that I made the wrong choice, but I also feel like my union isn't there to protect me. I feel like I paid more than $700 a year for someone to attack me. Some people have told me that I need to stay in the union.

It's your local, not the county, not the state, not the national.  Your local president did this to you (for what reasons, I'm not sure.  Truth is a three-edged sword).

&gt;I'm wondering what reasons people have for joining/staying in the teachers union.

Honestly, I'm a union officer in my local.  I joined originally because I was new.  That was 13 years ago.  I have stayed because I have had to rely on my union for protection years ago when I had a colleague come gunning for me.  It did not go the same way yours went.  I have stayed because they only real way to effect change is to remain involved.  I saw some things that I was unhappy with within my union, so I got involved.  I became a building representative and rose to an officer's position.  I stay because in this day and age it is easy for a career to be ruined by words, not actions.  It is easy to be accused of something and have no one there to back you up.  That is what your union is for.

TLDR: My union president came after me, unprovoked, and I feel like I'm paying to not be supported. Should I rejoin the union or just save my money?


Edit: grammar"
Middleschoolteachers,"The school I worked at in southern Arizona had a long term sub in my position for the first half of the school year and now I just found out admin will now be teaching those classes after break. When they were interviewing for it, there were out of state candidates from recruiting fairs as well as students who could teach while simultaneously working on their education degree so it could double dip as their student teaching while also getting paid for full time work. At this point they try to get a body in the room and get them certified in some way as soon as they can. 

So any middle school ela teachers who need a job and want a change, I know a place. "
Middleschoolteachers,"8th grades Social Studies teacher here....as far as the kids go I think the most important thing that you can do is to treat the kids like humans. You don't have to talk down to kids, you can command respect while still being kind. Also, be sure to remind yourself often how hard being a middle school aged kid is. It helps to keep that in mind the your are dealing with middle school knucklehead behavior. 

As far as teaching social studies goes I try to keep my lessons as interesting and relevant as possible. If I can connect something to current events or real life situations I do. The awesome thing about social studies is that while we have to teach certain objectives, we can make the lessons our own since we aren't subjected to standardized tests. 

I save everything!  There are plenty of lessons that I have tweeked over the years and now use every year. It saves me tons of plan time!

Good luck and have fun!!"
Middleschoolteachers,"NJ 3rd year middle school teacher here. Quite happy with my job, and I am definitely not teaching in a well off area. It is pretty competitive out here though."
Middleschoolteachers,Job fairs start in February and if you are open to middle school Henrico has had several openings lately. I sub for Hanover and Henrico currently while searching for a full time position.
Middleschoolteachers,"Sounds like a Title I school. Please don't take this the wrong way, as I'm not criticizing you or questioning your honesty but I cannot fathom a school with a high % of low income students having an admin tell teachers they can send students to the office for having a sidebar conversation. My school  is only 30% FARMS and I can tell you right now that if we had a similar policy, there would literally be 300-500 kids (out of a 2000 student HS) in the office every period. It would be complete pandemonium. 

If I had a similar policy in the Title I middle school that I worked in, at least 400 of the 900 students would be getting sent out regularly. 

Best case scenario at my current school, there would be between 50-100 kids being sent out multiple times per day. That would be untenable. What kind of consequences do kids get when they are sent to the admin? That may give a hint to how they control the number of students being sent out regularly. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Our district’s elementary schools have teachers focus on certain areas like those you mentioned and often the ELA-focused teachers have expressed to me that they believe they have a higher work load— this could also be due to the majority of our students being ELs as well. Additionally, we don’t have a library so ELA teachers (self included, at the middle school level) do have the extra work load of running our computerized check out system + acquiring and coding books for the school + chasing down fines etc. 

Unsure of other schools without this extra lift."
Middleschoolteachers,"Google Docs and Slides! My middle school is 1:1 with iPads, and we use Google for our word processing and presentation making needs. Best part - the students share the doc with you, and you can see what they're doing when they're doing it in the document (plus time stamped changes, so no more ""I worked on it last night and it deleted"" excuses). It's great for feedback on writing. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, if students and teachers are trained on how to make use of the technology.

I've seen a middle school where every student is issued an iPad in 7th grade. None of the teachers received training on how to use the iPads in the classroom or to get any systems set up. The students just used them to play games.

On the other hand, I work with someone who is a technophobe. Insists on using a flip phone, let's everyone know how damaging social media and cell phones are. Yet everyone around him uses their devices to get their job done without distraction and he doesn't see this."
Middleschoolteachers,"I am considering abruptly making a shift to teaching early in my career as I can see that what I do, while it is with a great company, and there is an upward trajectory on my path, is just not fulfilling. I've done art my whole life, went to art school for a year, (stay away from Art Institute!) and now I want to see if this is something I would enjoy. 

My mother who is a middle school english teacher is suggesting to do some substituting when I can, but the problem is I work 40 hours a week, from 8 to 5. What is the best way I can do this? Some ideas I have are:

* Run an after school art program with the cooperation/assistance of a school
* Offer to substitute specifically for art teachers, and do half-days (this one seems highly unlikely)
* 

That's really all I can think of...how else can I get some good experience with shadowing a teacher?"
Middleschoolteachers,"Many people who experience the rigors of elementary education have this self-doubt. I experienced it just this year when I did service learning at various sites. 

I have a friend who did multiple subject credential, has taught for over a year, fourth grade, and will not renew at the end of this year. Says that choosing elementary work was one of his greatest mistakes. Not exactly a confidence booster for someone like me (still in college). 

Well. I've talked to other folks, and they tell me that middle school jobs if you can get them, offer greater flexibility and time off. I'm aiming for a middle school job myself. Look into it yourself before writing off teaching. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Have you volunteered in k-12 or substituted before? If you're really uncertain what level or subject that can be a good way to help decide. I knew I wasn't meant for K when I came home from my first day subbing in K. 

The younger your students are, the better at teaching and management you need to be. It's easier to start with younger students and become a good teacher and move older than vice versa. So if you're really undecided, doing elementary and then adding authorizations by taking the corresponding csets and methods course/s isn't a bad way to do it. I added authorization, so I have two single subject credentials. 

Doing elementary can also lead to teaching in either blocks (English and Social Studies together or Math and Science together) in middle school. At sufficiently needy schools, you may be able to get a single subject job anyway. Friend was the only Social Studies credentialed person at his school site in his department, everyone else was multiple. 

If you want to stay local to yourself, take a look at job postings from your local districts. See who is hiring for what. "
Middleschoolteachers,"There are no courses for me to retake, I've never taken one in the first place. When I say I haven't gone over this information, I'm saying my undergraduate and career was in something completely different. Last time I learned all this information was in middle school/ high school. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Hi. I need to put a disclaimer that I'm not a teacher yet-- I'm going into my fourth year. I attended a few CSET workshops at my CSU school recently, so I'm knee deep in this stuff. 

What you heard about the situation on the ground with lack of job postings at the secondary level is true, at least from hearsay. Both friends and faculty have attested to it. The fact really is that English &amp; Social Science jobs are the hottest jobs to get in K-12. 

I will say, however, that you can't think about things like that. I'm not necessarily a person that believes in fate... But you never know when a job posting will open up for you, and you'll be the right person for it. 

That said, going the multiple subject route is probably the way to go. You have to pass an exam called the RICA which is supposedly a beast. It's heavy on linguistics content. And of course, the CSETs. I've since learned that with a multiple subject credential, one can teach at the middle school level, provided you took a 'block' i.e. English and Social Science. 

And finally, if you still want the high school English job, then all you have to do is pass the English CSET (heh, easier said then done) and go back to school once more for a single methods course to add on. No additional internship needed if you already have one credential. 

I have a friend right now is pursuing a high school credential (decided elementary wasn't for him), and he explained that his methods course was a cake walk, and had he had to do the internship in the high school subject, it would've so much more difficult. This is heavily anecdotal--I can't substantiate it myself--but from rumblings like those, it seems that single subject internships are tougher than elementary ones. Again, this is probably heavily situational. Every credential program is different and hard asses can be found anywhere. 

"
Middleschoolteachers,"One of my professors told us to do this- she called it punk rock teaching. Forget all of the nonsense the school requires and just teach the kids what they need to know, in the best way that works for her and the students. That might be project based learning. It might be student led lessons and research. 

The other thing that professor told me was not to let 12 year olds (I teach middle school) dictate my mood. it took about half of a school year for that to really make sense to me. I couldn't keep taking home whatever mood they had thrust upon me with their behavior or problems or whatever. Do I still care about my students and feel heartbroken when they don't do well or I learn some new horrible thing about their home lives? Absolutely. But I do my best to leave it at work. I have a routine at the end of my work day that helps me to mentally switch from 'teacher' to 'normal human'. I can't carry all of that with me, or I'd burn out within a week. 

If I were you, I'd encourage her to take some time to be a normal human and not just a teacher. Prep her lunches. Start doing crock pot dinners so neither of you have to worry about cooking when you get home from a long taxing day. 

Remind her that she can only guide and teach and encourage her students- she can't make them learn against their will. If she's making every effort to remediate a student and nothing is changing, that's all she can do. I have one girl that refuses to turn in work. She's the smartest girl I teach, but she's failing my class because she literally won't turn in any work. She's had to stay for tutoring, she's been held in my classroom for lunch in order to complete projects and papers, she's been invited to Saturday school. I've called and emailed home. I've had one-on-one conversations with her. She's still failing. I've done everything I can- now it's on her. Sometimes that can be the hardest thing to accept as a teacher, because student failure feels so personal. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Hi! I'm a science teacher for middle school grades and here's my thoughts.  The biggest thing holding me back from inviting guest speakers into my classroom is that I don't know for sure exactly what they plan to do. It's important to me if I give you my classroom that you actually engage the kids and cover the content that's in the standards.

  I've had speakers who were very nice but too quiet and meek for middle schoolers. I've had a speaker who had a great idea that was perfect for illustrating the content but involved an activity with spoons and beans where kids had to listen carefully and then go crazy for a bit and then stop and listen again...  I ended up having to work my butt off to maintain discipline and clean up afterwards (which would have been fine but I hadn't prepared to do this in advance).  Yet another speaker was very knowledgeable but prepared a college level PowerPoint that just had my kids totally lost.  

Basically what I'm getting at is, please share every detail of your speaker presentations with the teacher in advance.  I would highly suggest sending it directly to the media specialist / librarian, or possibly the math coach or literacy coach (I think most school websites should have these staff listed)."
Middleschoolteachers,"A former colleague of mind had very similar credentials. After teaching high school and middle school, she switched to working at a local zoo as their school and teacher programs supervisor. "
Middleschoolteachers,"My class is mostly reading instruction, essay composition, and a small amount of research and grammar; I use literature as a means to those ends, not as the end in itself. I think building reading stamina with rich, authentic texts is really important in the middle grades, rather than just learning to master the easy answers and short lessons found in basal readers. 

I would also like to see a stronger focus on grammar and punctuation during middle school than what currently occurs in my district, along with a higher standard for proper letter formation in handwriting. It’s really, really hard to get a 14-18-year-old to stop putting random capital letters in their writing, or to stop drawing lowercase Bs like plus signs, or to put full spaces between their words, or to remember to use apostrophes for possessives, if they haven’t been held accountable for those things in a long time (if ever) - they want to argue that these things don’t matter, because their prior teachers, and teachers in other subjects areas, don’t prioritize it. I think it’s easier to teach good habits when they are younger than it is to un-teach bad ones in high school. But most of my ninth graders come in with little skill in all of these areas, and we work through it regardless. I know MS/JH teachers are doing the best they can, just like the rest of us.

II probably teach basics more than anything else, and try to embed some opportunities for critical thinking along the way. The only real skills I count on them coming in with is the ability to decode text and compose simple sentences; I’ve had to teach basically every other skill you can think of in ELA. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach at a rural middle school and I agree with your comments about marks for mediocrity. My honors 8th graders were pissed when they didn’t get full points on their essays simply because they did one. When we practiced revision, they said it was perfect, didn’t make changes that were suggested and turned in final drafts with edit marks on their essays. This happened for both students who used Google Classroom and those who chose to hand write it. This lead me to teach a mini unit on editing. Things like capitalization and punctuation are still issues with my students. I just wish I could get my 8th graders to try. Many of them are still concrete but the helplessness and apathy with the knowledge they will go on to high school and middle school grades don’t matter is frustrating at times. 

As a high school teacher, do you worry about the basics or focus more on teaching them to think critically and interact with the texts? What skills do you want your incoming students to have?"
Middleschoolteachers,"Daily PE?  I moved states, and my kids now have it every-other day.  I was amazed!  I came from a state where kids had PE one day a week for 40 minutes in elementary.  I didn't have PE at all in middle school, and I had it one semester in high school."
Middleschoolteachers,"Hey that’s my area! Early intervention is ESSENTIAL for student success if the student is struggling. The biggest thing I like about RTI models is that it stresses continual changes to groupings - if Student A is really having a hard time with oral fluency, then that student is put into my fluency group and for several weeks that’s ALL we do. Student A can then test out. An effective RTI model can really help more students because the groupings can change every few weeks. You have to be careful with RTI though because it stresses a magic pill way of thinking - If I can just fix Student B’s informational text comprehension then everything will be okay again! Reading is not like that, there’s many processes occurring at the same time to lead to understanding and you can’t isolate one and expect it to be the magic solution. 

I teach at a 5, 6, 7 middle school and we have five reading teachers in our school, of which I am one. When we were doing our initial round of assessments and data combing and grouping, it was very clear that A LOT of students needed our help, but due to limits of our schedules and not enough people, some kids who could really use a semester of reading intervention don’t qualify. I really think we could increase our test barriers to the lowest 32-35% of students instead of capping at 25%, and have three interventionists per grade level. Right now we have one interventionist doing all of 7th, don’t tell me that’s enough, it’s definitely not. 

We need more specialists and we need them at ALL levels of K-12. There’s a huge focus on primary and elementary specialists but there’s still kids who need help in middle and high school. "
Middleschoolteachers,"This is more specific to 7th graders, but the students I work with seem to have a hard time taking ownership for their education. Maybe it's something about the transition from elementary to middle school, but they tend to expect the teacher to tell them every little thing to do, and are afraid to do anything on their own because they don't want to do it ""wrong."" It can be paralyzing for some students if they aren't told exactly what to do point for point, and often results in incomplete or missing homework. 

Of course, the other result for not taking responsibility for their education is to ignore directions completely and do minimal effort. I work as a tutor in a school, so I've worked with a diverse population of students and seen how they react to different teaching styles, so I don't think it's due to an individual teacher's style, but rather the students seeing education as the teacher's responsibility, not their's. 

Those are my thoughts, anyway."
Middleschoolteachers,"I just moved from 3rd to middle school, and I have no idea what 12 year olds do with pencils!?!?  I finally gave them 2 with their name on it and if they needed one from me they had to give me a 👟!"
Middleschoolteachers,Organization. I structured my entire master's thesis around the concept of organizational skills in middle school. 
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and I would STILL be direct and honest with them. I usually go along the lines of what kind of reputation her new friends have and if that's the reputation they want. I also always make sure to say that they can take or leave my advice but that I care enough to at least put my two cents in. That was i'm not coming off as patronizing, I recognize this is a choice they're making, and I leave it open for them to come back. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I’d say well over half, like around 60-70% of the kids in the middle school I teach at read below grade level, and probably 25% or so read *WAY* below grade level. That’s honestly more of a community problem, but that’s the single biggest issue I know of in my school.

Others include lack of study habits and critical thinking skills."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach high school algebra I.  The 9th graders I get are lacking basic arithmetic skills.  I know the bright students take algebra in middle school and not in high school, but the majority of 9th graders cannot add, subtract, multiple or divide.  Forget fractions and decimals.  They can’t handle 1 and 2 digit numbers.  

Also they have no work ethic.  They think they will get everything in life just because they want it.  

"
Middleschoolteachers,"I would often tell my middle school students, You are who you sit next to. Look closely. Consider their actions and probable destination in life. Is that the bus you want to be on? "
Middleschoolteachers,"That’s nice, that’s another thing I hate about middle school, I have these godforsaken kids ALL YEAR LONG. It kills me."
Middleschoolteachers,"My degree is in 9-12 social studies, and I taught at a high school my first year and loved it. It was only 50% (I taught two instead of three classes) and I worked my ass off. I was only contractually obligated to be there during those times I taught, so I could theoretically get there and teach and then go home, but I stayed and planned nearly every single day. I knew it would probably turn into a full-time job at the end of the year, so I tried to kiss as much ass as possible. 

At the end of the year, it did in fact turn into a full-time position, and I had to interview for it again and seemingly thought it was a formality, because I had done everything right and by the books, but they gave it to some fucking loser with a PE degree who took the praxis so he could teach social studies and coach wrestling. I got fucked, in other words.

So at the recommendation of the lead teacher, I tried out middle school and I wound up at (unknowingly) the single worst middle school in the county and have been there for the past couple years. I’m pretty much in a permanent state of misery, but luckily I love my coworkers, so that’s the only thing keeping me sane."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was part time (well, honestly full-time, I taught two instead of three classes) at a local high school a couple years ago and loved it. That’s the only year so far I haven’t strongly disliked. I think it’s more to do with it being high school instead of part time though, because I can’t stand middle school."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was teaching university students and man, they were lazy and dumb as fuck. I thought, it couldn't get worse in middle school and I was right."
Middleschoolteachers,"Wow! Great job. 

All I’ve done is fill out some recommendation letter forms for middle school. I teach 5th though, and it sounds like you’re teaching higher grades if you have multiple classes. 

I do want to have my planning done at least a few weeks ahead before school starts. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Sped teachers are in extremely high demand and likely any job you get will be sped.  Sped is unlikely to give you lots of opportunities to teach history.    Special ed math or special ed LA are more common, but where I am anyway Social Studies is often skipped or gen ed for most kids in sped (middle school anyway).  

So it will make finding a job easier, but you're likely to be a SPED teacher.  If you don't want to teach SPED, don't do it.   In my area I've seen a lot of social studies/ELL overlap though where the teacher still teaches history, and ELL is also high demand.

Edit: that being said, I do have a SS endorsment and am working on my Sped endorsment, but I want to teach sped, not ss.  I just realized a bit late.

Actually, you might be better off getting a Language Arts/Social Studies cert, especially if you want to do middle school.  I know some principals aren't even bothering to look at Social Studies teaches without LA endorsements in the middle schools in my area.  I don't know how that would translate to high school."
Middleschoolteachers,"Administration at ALL levels (school, district, state, and federal) need to nix social promotion for good. Instead of social promotion, we need serious tiered support for our struggling students and, in upper grades, tracked paths for students who continue to not show an interest in advancing their academic studies and would rather study a trade/vocational discipline.

In my district, students can be held back twice: once in elementary school, and once in middle school. Not in high school. I teach the inaugural year at my middle school and most of the kids come in as complete messes. While a little bit of transitional struggle is expected, I was stunned to find out that out of my 105 kids, 20 were socially promoted--and I'm sure these numbers are much higher in other areas.  Social promotion does nothing to help these students. By the time they come to me, they already assume that they're going to be passed on forever. In high school, several of them drop out or just barely pass 12th grade and then have extreme difficulty finding work. It's ridiculous. Stopping this ludicrous policy of social promotion and instead implementing real supports/pathways for our students would be an excellent start to give ALL students the education that they deserve."
Middleschoolteachers,"""Newman's Authentic Intellectual Work"" literally got me an interview and a job offer. The principal told me when I got to the interview she wanted me to come in the second she saw I had that on my cover letter. I only turned it down because it was a LTS and I was waiting to hear back in multiple 1.0 FTE jobs. 

I agree with the buzzword sentiment, however. If you can at least get in to the interview, I think you have good chances of finding a job. I interviewed at all 3 middle schools in my current district, they passed my name between the schools, and I was hired at one of them.

Buzzwords, attitude/personality, and the school or district aligning with your style or philosophy seems to be the golden ticket in my experience. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Ditto, only I teach alt ed middle school. "
Middleschoolteachers,"The biggest problem with education is that we're still using a model from the 1800s, BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER. That's why we still have up to 34 kids to 1 teacher in most classrooms. Because it's CHEAP.

That's also why most teachers are female. If more men were in the profession they would demand higher pay and fewer hours of work at home. (They have already demanded that by not being the in profession and choosing more lucrative professions that provide them with more down-time after work and more camaraderie with colleagues.)

How to fix this? Maybe all schools starting in 1st grade should have class periods with specialists? The kids go from room to room, switching every hour or two. Two hours for LA, 90 minutes for math, 90 minutes for science, 150 minutes spread through the week for music and art, and 2 hours a week on social studies and history. (I'm shorting SS and history only because there's not enough hours in the week.)

Why would this work? Because teachers would no longer have to prep for 5 or 6 subjects in the day. They would just have to worry about one. They could become experts. 

HOWEVER, this also means we need smaller class sizes. 20 max, in K-12.

WHY? Because for all but high-income families, being a kid in America today is HARD. 1 out of every 4 or 5 kids lives in poverty with all the insecurity and mayhem that brings. I think it's about 50% that are being raised in single parent households now. Kids lives SUCK in many ways these days. 

The system designed in the 1800s was built on small-town life, two parent families with one parent home most of the day to handle emergencies. Plus, in the 1800s, basic RESPECT of adults was  taught at home. Those teachings, or respecting your place in the pecking order of a school, flew out the window starting in the 1980s. NO ONE respects teachers anymore, and respecting teachers is not taught in many homes. 

So if the kids aren't learning social skills and respect at home, that teaching duty falls to the schools. Elementary teachers spend hours and hours every year teaching little kids how to function in society.  That's the MAIN reason classes should never be more than 20 - so kids can be a part of a large family during the day, to learn this stuff, and not just a face lost in the crowd. 

Same with middle school and high school - no more than 20 per class, to meet their emotional and maturation needs. 

ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY. The federal government is like a Deadbeat Dad who doesn't want to pay.

So then, because we don't fix all these issues early, Deadbeat Dad gets to be employed by the local prison, where all his failed children wind up. 

Oh, and one easy fix that also costs MONEY - every school with more than 500 kids should have at least one full-time counselor, and every school district should have at least one full-time child psychologist on staff to supervise and advise all the counselors. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Almost every American student takes civics in middle school and high school.

Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school.

When I taught 8th grade science, I had 30ish kids in a class that tested everywhere from 1st grade to college level readers. I had to teach physics to students that couldn't add at the same time I had to teach students who spent their mornings travelling to the high school to take math classes at a higher level than what we could offer in our school.

Part of a school's success is measured by how much they discipline students. Which doesn't mean we use more effective behavior management, it means we just don't actually discipline anyone for anything less than a felony, so the numbers of suspensions looks great when the board is looking at their terrible school success metrics. We pull the kid out of class for 5 minutes give him/her a stern talking to, and send them right back to the class where they continue stopping any learning from happening. I've literally had kids fight in class, throw chairs, etc... and you think they're suspended, but what's actually happening is that the admin tells the parent to call them out of school for a few days so they're still out of school, but it's not adding to their behavior statistics.
"
Middleschoolteachers,"No, this educational philosophy has been around since the late 80’s. SOURCE: I’m a former elementary, now middle school teacher."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach at a Title 1 middle school, and I’ve found that involving the students in creating class rules or norms is very helpful. They decide (within reason) what is unacceptable and what consequences are appropriate, and then they tend to be more actively involved in regulating the classroom environment. Once you’ve agreed on a few positively-worded rules (use “do” instead of “don’t”), then post them prominently and refer to them regularly. Have a rule for independent work, one for group work, etc.

And, as many others have mentioned, stick with it, whatever it may be. Follow-through is everything."
Middleschoolteachers,"You should not be rebutting claims over email with parents. These conversations should occur over the phone with a documentation of the conversations after. If you're rebutting claims then you're missing the bigger picture. 5th grade grades offer the child the opportunity to target areas of improvement so they are ready for middle school. Be positive in all of your interactions. (Definitely keep the fact he's not engaged in school to yourself because I know my students' parents/admins would say an elementary teacher should be motivating students and not discounting a child as being disengaged.) Even if you're right (which you are probably are) you again nothing from making a parent angry. If your Principal is reasonable she will back you up when she says your data. If you're letting the parent get in your head then you are the one ruining your break and not the parent. As in any job, we need to unplug during our own vacation times. 

I also teach in a relatively affluent area and I enjoy interacting with parents. Any position has its positives and negatives and I know my skill set makes me a strong fit for such a position even when it means working with the difficult parent occasionally. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and have about 170 students. About 120 of them I have taught before, so those I’m good to go with. With the other ones, I make sure they have name tags on their desks and repeat them as much as possible. If there is one that I have a really hard time with, it try to come up with some type of saying or thing to associate with their name when I see them. For example, I have identical twins and one wear earrings while the other doesn’t. That is the only way I can tell them apart! "
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school (6-8) special ed in a rural title one school. 

My go-to is live school. It's kind of like class dojo on steroids, and kids can spend their points on rewards of your choosing. (ex: 25 points is a small snack, like a small bag of chips or cookies, 100 points is a large snack like a candy bar or pop tarts, etc.). You can also choose what they earn points for and how much each thing is worth (1 pt for coming to school, 5 points for turning in hw, 25 points for completing an IXL lesson, 100 points for a perfect test score, etc.). 

The middle school as a whole participates in ""stamp sheets"". Kids can earn one stamp for each period, usually for a period of about two weeks. If they make the goal, I think usually 75-80% of the total stamps possible, they get to participate in ""stamp sheet reward""... The week of stamp sheet reward, student body  government reps will ask for ideas (usually we end up with some variation of water play, arts and crafts, tech zone, movie, sports, however we're open to other ideas as long as they're reasonable) and the staff decides the final 5. Students who made their goal sign up for an activity and during the last elective period of that week (so usually friday 1:15-2:15) kids go to what they signed up for. If they didn't make their goal, they're in what's called ""staybacks"", which is essentially a study hall. 

I also have an RTI period that is EXTREMELY difficult to manage (it's 15-20 special ed kids, grades 6-8), who are all working on different assignments. For that block I usually write their names and assignments on the board, along with what they need to accomplish during the block. Once they accomplish their personal goal, I cross their name off but they must continue working on SOMETHING academic (could be homework for another class, reading, etc) until everyone gets their name crossed off the board, and then they may have free time for the rest of the period. It's an all-or-nothing kind of strategy, but it motivates even my laziest kids because they don't want everyone else to be mad at them, lol. 

I also call parents A LOT. I'm lucky because most of my parents, if they won't answer the phone, will at least respond to texts. And I do this for good things as well as bad things-- Hey, Johnny made 25% growth on his recent test! Or ""I just wanted to let you know that Suzy really put forth her best effort in reading today and made some really insightful comments, I'd love to see this continue!"". It's gotten to the point where the kids know I'm going to call and have started telling on themselves, and will often be more harsh than I was going to be. Example: On thursday lunch, I had two kids get into a ""scuffle""-- it wasn't a fight, per se, no punches were thrown, but it was physical, so I had to call both parents. When I called the 2nd parent, she told me her son had already told her the whole story, and how he knows he made a mistake and he's very remorseful and upset that he won't be able to apologize to the other kid until after winter break. (I'm sure it will be forgotten by the time that rolls around though). I know this isn't doable for everyone in every situation, but really investing in making parents a part of the school community has made a huge difference for me. It doesn't work for every kid, I still have an 8th grade girl who's single father hasn't come to a single meeting or returned a single call, text, or note. Lucky for me she's a good kid who just struggles academically. But don't get disheartened if this doesn't work right away or as well as I've described. I've certainly worked at schools where it was pretty much a lost cause and it just seems daunting and exhausting. At that point, you have to make a judgement call. Do you need the documentation for administration? for failing grades? To CYA? If so, push through. Reward yourself with a piece of candy every time. Do what you gotta do. 

I also make it a point to show kids that I appreciate them for who they are. I've made it VERY clear that my room is a safe-space if you just need to talk about life, if you need help with other classes, etc. My room is open 90% of the time during lunches, recesses, before school, after school. Sometimes I'm exhausted and I just need to close the door and either chill or get work done, but the kids are pretty understanding of that. I have a little following of non-sped kids that hang out in my room and help me with stuff, or ask for help in their classes. Sometimes I ask kids to hang back just to talk about how their lives are going. Some are into this, some clam up and I send them on their way. 

I use a TON of humor. I'm naturally a really snarky, sarcastic person. I never try to make kids feel bad about themselves, but I'm quick with the sarcastic comebacks and middle schoolers are weird so we jam with it. ""Misssssssss, this assignment is so extra!"" ""Marissa, quit being extra and do your work."" I usually give a pointed stare and raise an eyebrow as I take a sip of my tea. The class, including Marissa, thinks its hilarious, and she gets to work. I also tell them a lot of funny, exaggerated stories about myself. Like, I fully intend to tell them that I was so exhausted when I was leaving school thursday that I fell UP the stairs to my apartment. 

I'll be honest, I thought this book was a crock of shit when I first started teaching and was overwhelmed and felt like no one understood me, and I don't use any of the strategies it describes verbatim, but I've since taken a lot of inspiration from Teach Like a Champion.

Middleschoolteachers,"I have 150 students, and I struggle with remembering names in most normal settings. I have a couple of strategies that I use to help me remember or save my ass when I can’t. 

* I seat them in groups initially alphabetically by first name. 
* I carry a binder that has their names and spot, and I refer to it while I talk to the class, or wander around. 
* I make a game of it with the kids right off the bat, and ask them to challenge me. 
* I say their names out loud as I pass pack papers. This allows me to connect faces to names, and saves me if I blank on one. 
* I do my best to know something unique and identifiable *about* each kid, not a physical feature, just a personality or background detail that makes them easier to call to mind. Working with middle school kids, this relationship building aspect is absolutely crucial. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I kind of wish I quit my job mid-year last year. I'm at a MUCH better school this year with an extremely supportive administration, my preferred age group (middle school), an assistant I have previous experience goes above and beyond and I make an excellent team with (my areas of weakness are his strengths and vice-versa)... However my mental health has suffered tremendously since last year. I just had a pretty bad panic attack yesterday over nothing. Good for you, I'm proud of you! I hope that you are able to make things work with the least amount of stress possible. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I can attest to CHAMPS effectiveness in middle school. This is my third year teaching 7th ELAR in a Title I schoool, and I have seen a tremendous amount of growth in the way I manage the classroom. It's just about setting expectations for your classroom routines and various activities. Everyone's management style is different and finding the one that you're comfortable with takes time. "
Middleschoolteachers,"&gt;does one marking period grade in 5th grade even matter in life??? 

It matters when entering middle or high school.  When I moved to a new school for my middle school years, some kids entered pre-algebra and a literature course, and other kids entered courses below that level. Do well, and students could leave middle school with algebra completed, while other students entered high school needing to take algebra.

 My own kids are in a small K-8 school without differentiated learning. So the only thing within the school that matters is whether they progress to the next grade level.

In the transition to high school, incoming students from my kids' K-8 school are placed into high school courses based on teacher recommendation. So their 8th grade teacher's opinion of their language arts and math abilities dictates their high school track unless a parent makes a fuss about getting some other form of assessment."
Middleschoolteachers,"So many great tips here! 

I teach a middle school elective. I make my rubrics very clear. For example, I layout what would earn an A, B.....F. I always include “work ethic” in it. I have them grade themselves and then I grade them. Sometimes I hang on to them as evidence for later. 

I also have students complete a “Student Information sheet. The top half of the paper are things like birthday, Name they want to be called, something that I can to do help them learn etc. The bottom half is empty. I place all the forms in a binder. Then when I need to document a student behavior or write a note about the student, I write it on their form with the date. "
Middleschoolteachers,I started getting them in 4th grade. I didn't have a GPA calculated until middle school and my GPA didn't really matter until high school (and even that didn't matter once college was underway). I'm about the same age as you.
Middleschoolteachers,"I don’t think I received letter grades until at least middle school, if not later, and this was 10-15 years ago. Perhaps things have changed since then?"
Middleschoolteachers,"Ditto- 0.

When I taught in middle school, I’d get some."
Middleschoolteachers,"One of my middle school students got me an adorable clutch and a fringed bottle opener (hard to describe, but it’s really fun). Those are both gifts I’ve never received before, but they’re great!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach at a middle/lower middle class middle school in the only ""urban"" area of a very rural county. 160 students this year. I got a box full of gift, three bags of homemade cookies, pumpkin bread, half a dozen $5 gift cards (all coffee related, my kids know me) and a stack of thank you letters. 

It's always the letters that mean the most, the one or two that really cared make all the difference in the world when you spend your day stopping fights and other nonsense that is anything but teaching. 

I used to teach at a posh all-girls private school. I'd get over a $100 in gift cards, loads of gifts and I've received wine before but honestly I'd never go back. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I love middle school and I've taught 7th grade for 10+ years. I genuinely enjoy 7th grade, believe it or not. There's some joy to seeing kids come in this moldable hot mess and see them exit as young adults.

But holy shit this year's 7th grade is a hot ass mess. And I mean a million times worse than any group of 7th graders I've had before. It's not a behavior thing as my classroom management is on point. This group of 7th graders just doesn't seem to get how to function independently. 

I chalk it up to one key - I'm one of the first people in their lives whose ever told them no. Whether it's the no you can't do that, no that behavior is not okay for the classroom or no half-assed work is not acceptable and I'm not just going to give you 100% on it, that no seems to leave them shook. 

I'm starting to wonder if there's something with kids of this age all around. At this point the 7th grade is usually moving towards independence and the group I have right now just tried an independent assignment and about 20% of them got what they had to do right. 

I keep telling myself May is closer than I think."
Middleschoolteachers,I would never ever ever teach middle school. I think it takes a certain type of person and that person is not me. I love high school tenth grade is where I shine! 
Middleschoolteachers,"Bless your heart! Don’t feel hopeless, you ARE cut out for middle school. From what you describe, many of the behaviors you endure sound like classic classroom management issues. You mentioned break, once you go back to school, have you thought about implementing a new set of expectations and classroom routines? "
Middleschoolteachers,"7th grade is the worst year of education. There are few souls cut out for teaching 7th grade who actually LIKE that age level, and those people are crazy and talented and should be left to do what they will (in terms of curriculum) with the 7th graders and given nothing but praise and medals, in my book. 

I taught 8th grade for years and did fine/enjoyed it. I had to do a few years in 7th and hated it so much. I currently teach 10th and its delightful. At my old middle school, we used to call 7th grade ""the lost year"" for awhile. Then, I heard an actual NPR segment on how at a certain growth stage/age (which usually corresponds with 7th grade for most kids) kids are literally incapable of learning due to the frequency and amount of rapid neural and physical changes hormones and such are creating in their brains and bodies. I was immediately like, ""Yeah, NPR, I believe it!"" No need to convince me. 7th graders are the worst, and it's not even their fault. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Australian ""middle school"" (usually integrated into high school) starts at what I believe is US grade 8 (13 year olds). I think it's a better point to divide them - US grade 7 is still part of primary school."
Middleschoolteachers,wow I have had the SAME question with nearly identical details! thank you!! middle school...
Middleschoolteachers,"13?? Freaking 13? As a current middle school admin there is no way I'd have you sit through that meeting. When I was in elementary (2nd-5th grade) I can see some level of trying to keep the sanctity of those beliefs, but in no way do I see a 7th/8th grader being ""ruined"" at that stage. The kid had to know by that age or this is some really sheltered place."
Middleschoolteachers,"&gt; go talk to your science teachers.

I dunno. Depends on their background. I have a fellow science teacher in the district who, at district meetings, has voiced her belief that vaccines cause autism and other defects. She got certified in science for middle school last minute on the request from her principal, if I understand the situation correctly."
Middleschoolteachers,"I had a freshman still believe in Santa this year! He was crushed when I made a joke about it (in a mixed-level class of 9-12 graders). I kind of feel bad, but really? High school?! I subbed in a middle school once around Christmas and admin specifically told me not the mention Santa since many kids there still believed in him. "
Middleschoolteachers,I teach in a middle school where the rule is for all phones to be in their locker or in the office. If a student has their phone with them during a test and they are caught it is seen as cheating. The phone would be taken away and then the student would have to make arrangements with the teacher to take the test at an alternative time. The original test is given a zero or a no grade because of the phone. 
Middleschoolteachers,"your unconditional support really does mean so much. 

I finally made the time today since it was early dismissal and last day until Jan, to reach out for mental health services. Unfortunately I struggled with anxiety/depression in college, have done tons of natural healing lifestyle things and have been unpleasantly surprised to see that those 8-year old feelings are coming back. Pretty sure I've had anxiety attacks before while teaching, just undetectable to most, if that makes sense. I did have to stop and lean against the counter with the dizziness, blurred vision, rapid heartbeat and more. A student was talking about something at the board so there wasn't direct attention on me, but still. I couldn't think, just be stopped by sensations. 

Anyway. Granted of my 5 classes the'yre not all terrible. one period has 99% fabulous days...only 5 kids, advanced. 
The rest are one day cute and motivated, one day heartless and non-stop interrupting. (This is middle school). I don't know why but it's my 2nd period that (for the past 2 weeks) has been stuck on my mind as well as incredibly infuriating, hurtful. not sure if it's cuz a bad rep kid got switched in 2 weeks ago (and he does enjoy finding anything to insult me on while snickering to peers, who instantly became loyal to this tiny guy...senseless stuff, just for the sake of..whatever his motive is...) but...
These guys are passive to the point it is painful. The simply do not produce work. This is Spanish for nAtive speakers level one. You cannot pass without listening, speaking, reading, writing. Plain and simple. They do listen, but none of the rest. I put in tons of scaffolding and modeling but when it comes their turn they literally just sit there. The ""I Do, You Do"" is fine, but the ""We Do"" is nothing. Okay, 1 or 2 kids will silently write the answers but refuse to share out. How else can I do closure/feedback?! Also, I've been trying to provide much more output opportunities since I saw I was lacking in it and since I gathered they were hearing me talk too much. 

Other probably useful info
-Only 11 kids
-Our entire school is very high-needs and underperforming, we've got, brace yourself, 80% at 2 or more grade levels below in Math and ELA.
-For the majority of them, I don't see how they passed the EL exam, they really seem to still need ELD.
-A colleague suggested they might BE failing ELA. I looked and their grades in my class were directly correlated with those in ELA. Almost all were failing this and ELA. One has a B- in my class and has an A in ELA. 


I know that was a lot and just typing it was helpful. 

I hope you treat yourself too!!

Middleschoolteachers,"I love my middle school students. 

I hate my middle school parents.  I had a kid turn in late work yesterday, and today at 6:45 am, she emailed me, my VP and my head of department demanding to know why the grade was not updated."
Middleschoolteachers,"Seconding this. The first time I subbed, I was requested regularly by a middle school prealgebra teacher because I got along with her trouble class. I told her I was considering getting my math cert and after that she gave me actual plans or review."
Middleschoolteachers,"Are you me? I'm having the same issue with my fifth graders. They're having a lot of difficulty adjusting to middle school life (we've got a fifth grade academy at my school) and I've NEVER had scores this low or behaviors this bad. I know scores aren't everything but my grade book right now looks like alphabet soup, even for my gifted classes.

I've been updating the students weekly on their grades in my classes and encouraging parents to check the online grade book weekly in order to see what's going on. One of my students has a 24 in math, I called her dad and he basically gave me the verbal version of a shoulder shrug. "
Middleschoolteachers,"This is his 3rd year teaching HS. Prior he taught middle school for 6 years, and coached the same HS sport. His coaching is both semesters, water sports, Fall is 1 sport and Spring another water sport.
Yes, he is ALWAYS exhausted, especially since he is OCD about exercising for himself 1 hour everyday after work. He is always falling asleep with me. I have had to tell him straight that after work he expends what energy is left towards working out, and then there is no energy left for me, and I cant get to know him by watching TV in his home for 1 hr before he has to sleep.
"
Middleschoolteachers,"I don’t get annoyed but I feel bad when I don’t remember former students. Plus I teach second grade and people look very different  once they reach middle school!  I always like to say hi to former students- it’s helpful when they say something like, “Hi Mx. Rootibega!  My name’s —— ; you were my second grade teacher!”  

Teachers of upper grades may feel differently. I like it though- I feel like hardly anyone remembers second grade. "
Middleschoolteachers,"My ""challenging"" class this year has some real turkeys in it. I found out last week that basically close to a third of them are involved in this online Instagram feud that got dragged into school, and most of them have been in and out of school this week for ISS or something similar. So this weekend my task is rewriting their seating chart. It's going to be difficult, though, because literally like maybe 7 of them can't be sitting anywhere near each other. How am I supposed to do that? It's not that big of a class...

Anyway, my positive moment is that this class has a big writing assignment coming due, and I'm really pleased with the way (some of them) are working on it. They've been coming in at lunch, asking for extra help, asking to move away from friends so they can concentrate better, etc. At least they give a shit... which some of my students last year definitely did not. I've also been enjoying conversations with them when they come in for lunch. Some of them have asked if they can come in every day, even after the assignment is over. I like my lunch period as alone time... but I also remember being in middle school and not wanting to be in the cafeteria for various reasons. It might help keep them out of drama. So we'll see.

&amp;#x200B;"
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and sometimes it can be uncomfortable because I don’t remember them. I’ve had thousands of students over the years and unless it’s a kid I was close to (coached them or something) I have a hard time remembering kids, especially their names, years down the line. 

As long as it won’t hurt your feelings to have to remind them who you are, I think it’s probably fine. But even when they remind me, I still sometimes can’t remember who they are. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Yeah, it actually did! It got several kids who didn't like getting their work done, to actually get their work done. There were a few who still didn't care but it was nice to see kids working harder for a little game time on the Chrome Books. If kids didn't get it done, they'd have to just sit at their desk during free time and work on any unfinished assignments before having fun. I think that the 5th grade teachers did the same type of thing as well as the middle school. "
Middleschoolteachers,They totally are. When I tell them we get to write they get excited. Unfortunately I'm sneaking it in without admin knowing. These kids go off to middle school without knowing how to write a complete sentence much less a paragraph or short story/essay
Middleschoolteachers,A monthish ago the middle school home EC class caught on fire from a faulty burner but there wasn’t any major damage just lost some counter/cupboards and a couple stoves 
Middleschoolteachers,"I have two least-favorite classes, so one from each:

One I had a talk with asking what more they needed from me. The class was just constantly me yelling at them to stop talking long enough so I could give instruction. (It's middle school. Not yelling doesn't seem to work. I tried.) They said they didn't need anything more--they needed to do better. So I'm holding them to it. The class is always whack-a-mole on hard mode. I put a list on the board of students who needed to turn in their phones and a student tried to go around and collect them.

On Thursday, I had my first good lesson with my other hard class. Half the class has an ADD diagnosis. 1/3rd of the class has talked to the principal, with 1/4th already having OSS. I picked a short story out of our book, read it out loud (I'm not supposed to do this) and had a pretty productive conversation with them about it. We'll finish it on Monday (class is every other day.) It was really great to see. "
Middleschoolteachers,My middle school kids sometimes will say the floor is lava but it doesn’t catch on quite the way it does with the little ones 
Middleschoolteachers,"I lucked out this year and got an aid who used to be a middle school teacher for several years, and she rocks at math. She’s the best breath of fresh air a teacher could ask for, and she walks around while kids are doing independent work and forces those sped kiddos to be accountable. I love it.

Having said that, for three years prior, I had aides that usually showed up 20 minutes late, left 20 minutes early, wouldn’t help grade, wouldn’t help teach, wouldn’t help plan, wouldn’t help tutor, but loved to tell me all about the frustrations of their job and why they always had to come late or leave early. The only benefit I saw to having them in class was the CYA element, meaning that their presence in class is what I could write off in iep meetings as “services met.” "
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught k-6 general music for a few years and now I teach middle school orchestra. I love it, but it’s not always easy. There is often high competition for music teachers. I’m on my third district and second state and finally feel like I have the position I wanted coming out of college. You’re unlikely to be teaching electronic music or only learning electronic. I teach a lot of private lessons and play music outside of school. If you’re interested I would say check out what your potential college’s music Ed degree program looks like (often more difficult than people expect. For example, I took 18-22 credit hours. every semester) and shadow local music teachers. Maybe talk to music Ed undergrads as well. If you’re one who likes free time, it may not be the path for you. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Every time I’ve done Teacher Appreciation, I’ve run it through student council. They tend to have a decent pulse on the school, on what the teachers like, etc. 

My experience is with high school, so I can’t speak for elementary or middle school teachers. I put together a cool thing with them last year that required a shit ton of work, but ended up being awesome. I surveyed the teachers to find out where they graduated from and contacted the alumni departments of all the universities seeking donated gifts. Each teacher got a gift bag with supplies and gifts from their alma mater. It was a cool way to talk with our students about college, too, and why we chose the schools we did. 

I personally think a discount would be better, but I’ll be honest— some people won’t use it. If it requires work on their end, it doesn’t feel like “appreciation” the way free stuff does! Not that I’ll sneeze at a discount when it’s for something I want or need, but I won’t go out of my way to get limited-time things like that. What teachers appreciate when being appreciated is time— my best teacher appreciation gift was my principal coming in, taking over my class for 15-20 minutes, handing me a cupcake and a soda, and telling me to just take a break. We like to be fed, sugared, and given a chance to step away from the classroom for something other than microwaving our lunch or peeing between classes 😂"
Middleschoolteachers,"I have my ""office hours"" set at 7-5. I don't answer *or* send messages outside those hours, because I've discovered in the past that if I do parents are more than happy to stomp all over boundaries using the app. I'm very strict, for my own sanity.  

None of my students are on the app though.l, I teach middle school. Just parents. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I love it. They're fantastic and crazy and they learn how to be human over the year. It's super emotionally draining sometimes because I am definitely a substitute Mom to some of them during the day but they're cuddly, hilarious and unique little kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I subbed in a middle school classroom once and said ""never again"" because I hated it. I think part of the first few years of teaching is finding what grade level excites you and what makes you happy. I love primary, my best friend loves middle, we're both great teachers but have different tastes. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I had a full conversation with my middle schoolers the day I got back from my bereavement leave about my sister's death due to a heroin overdose.  I wanted to have that conversation (at a different level, obviously) with all of my students, but my admin said no.  I figure middle school is better than nothing though.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I will answer literally anything a student asks me as long as it's school appropriate and not my personal contact info :)"
Middleschoolteachers,"Yeah it would not fly. I was subbing in a fifth grade room and a kid comes crying up to me saying that his friends are cheating at a game and are being mean to him. With my limited info (I don’t get into he said they said). I look at this little kid, puffy red eyes wiping his nose in his sleeve and I saw myself at that age and I knew if I could get laughing it’d fix me up pretty quick. So I get the classes attention and say “hey guys, we’re all in this class together so let’s not be buttholes to our friends”. Bingo, kid goes into the giggles and for the rest of the day he’s happy, productive and the class in general was nicer to each other.

Next day I get a call from my sub coordinator asking whether I called a student an “asshole”,  probably courtesy of the parent of the kid was in fact being an asshole. I of course did not and would not. I explain the situation and she seems to get my point, I have a spotless record, but she told me not to swear in front of students ever again. I rolled my eyes (we were on the phone) joked with my coworkers about it and got on with my day.

For further context in middle school I had a (relatively) foul mouth English teacher and everyone in the class loved her because she kept it real."
Middleschoolteachers,"If your teacher didn’t know the answer, you’re right, she should have told you that she didn’t know. However you’re what, middle school? High school? You have access to technology and can find the answers to straightforward questions yourself rather than being so rude. If you talk this way to your teachers, they might find it difficult to engage with you. Some basic respect goes a long way. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I subbed for a kindergarten class for 1 day. Never again. the polar opposite of fun, and I teach middle school and love it"
Middleschoolteachers,"My middle school English classes are scripted; my social studies classes are not. It’s really frustrating because I can tell that the kids hate the book we’re reading. They keep asking if we can read another book as a class. I have to repeatedly explain to them that I did not get to pick anything we do in that class. It’s so hard to get them interested in it, partially because I’m not interested in it. One of my other classes is reading a book I’ve read before and love so that class is a little easier to deal with, but it’s a bit torturous still. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, I do. It's very frustrating, and I feel the same way. We also have an ""approved instructional materials"" list (approved books list) which doesn't take into account the books we have class sets of and an approved list of classroom library books (which excludes books with things like homosexuality, despite the director insisting our kids need to be able to see themselves in the books.) Sure, it's middle school, but I also have an openly gay student. We're not introducing them to anything they don't already grapple with.

&amp;#x200B;

We're told we don't have to use the lessons verbatim, so I don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the same problem TheCluesILeftForYou has, which is that it takes me multiple days to get through a lesson which ruins all sense of day-to-day structure. I also have the problem of it expecting students to know things they don't. (For example, nearly everything has a graphic organizer which they regularly find confusing, and which doesn't have a space for them to put their name down.)"
Middleschoolteachers,I got my start teaching middle school science and i've been in your situation before.  I might have some stuff you can use send me a PM if interested.
Middleschoolteachers,"In my middle school, we were a very VERY small public school, (like 50 kids in our whole grade and 7 teachers in general). When going on a week long field trip to a campground, we just had like 12 parents who volunteered to be chaperones in the cabins each take their own kid and 3 other kids on carpools to the destination. It still seems a bit sloppy in hindsight, but I guess the fact that our teachers were already trusting them to sleep in a cabin with us, driving us around didn't seem too much out there.

&amp;#x200B;

All the same, probably a bad idea."
Middleschoolteachers,"Haven’t lost a kid yet and I’ve been doing this 7 Years now. Weird. I also teach middle schoolers who are a different breed of humans in general. We were at a camp all day today doing activities outside with 130+ students. 

But when I get on the buses, I take attendance as they walk on. We have sneaky students that try and make their own groups and pick their own buses (that we create based on behavior) and we have to prevent that happening. My school is rough... getting cussed out by a student happens often, for example. Nothing is that easy. "
Middleschoolteachers,"You're telling me. I am completely overwhelmed. This is my first year and I'm at a private school. Instead of easing me in, they threw everything at me. I'm a middle school science teacher now teaching 2 periods of 6th grade science, 1 period of 7th grade science, 2 periods of 8th grade science, 1 period of 6th grade religion, 1 period of 6th grade vocabulary, had to organize and participate in the 6th grade annual camping trip, and organize the 8th grade science fair. I am the ONLY middle school science teacher. I barely have good mentors. The curriculum is 20 years old and the previous teachers left practically nothing. I'm in a classroom with an average of 30 students each period and the classroom itself is an old elementary classroom so its super small and not equipped for labs what so ever. I constantly have parents complaining that I'm not doing enough and letting them know of due dates a head of time. I'm an introvert so at the end of the day I'm physically, mentally, and emotionally spent so I barely have time to plan anything in advanced because I need to recharge. People keep telling me to look for pre-made units, but those are only good if you have time to go through all of them, read them entirely, and have enough time to prep the materials they require. I have clinical depression and to be honest, I'm not sure if I'll make it to 2019. There really are no other jobs for me to switch to. I've been hunting for full-time employment for 5 years and this is the first full-time job I've gotten since graduating college. I'm a wreck. So I completely understand your frustration. If I'm like this as a first year, I can't image what it's like as a veteran. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes I felt like that many times.  My concern and affection for my students kept me coming back.  I taught middle school and it was not easy.  Things that helped me were:  taking a mental health/sick day, having educational videos on Fridays or Mondays, having a ""student exchange"" agreement with another teacher where I could send them a student and they could send me one if the student was out of control and disrupting the class, and finally having fresh coffee after work, by purchasing a coffee maker to have at school.  "
Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks for the suggestions. I know I'm not there to be their friend, but I've always hear that cracking down later in the year after coming on too soft can have some serious consequences for the student-teacher relationships. That's mostly what I meant.

Where I struggle with some of this is that I'm teaching abroad and there are 12 8th grade classes that all need to learn the same content at the same time. I'm not even their only English teacher either -- I co-teach with several others.

I'll try to figure out something that works. I can see the look of frustration and boredom on the faces of the good ones and it breaks my heart. More consequences for sure, and I've already been trying to think of some prizes I can implement in the context of my school.

Thanks for your answer. I'm just getting the feeling my personality doesn't mesh with middle school."
Middleschoolteachers,"I passed right over this post until the edit. But I have to say it from a growth perspective; I was that kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a bad case of class clown disease in school, but it wasn't because I wanted an adversarial relationship with my teacher.  It was because I wasn't getting validation for things like being quiet, doing my work, staying on task, getting high marks, etc... Kids that disrupt your class often do it because they are getting validation from it that they aren't getting elsewhere or for other actions. Obviously home life plays a big part (if parents are reinforcing positive behaviors at home the child is psychologically wired to seek praise over punishment), but for those kids often school is a way for them to seek that validation.  


I was a latchkey kid with two full-time working parents. I had internal motivations for doing well in school and began with that intention, but outwardly I noticed very early (second/third grade) that the ""bad"" kids got more attention from the teacher as well as the other students. I never made friends because I got the highest grade on the spelling test or went a week without a disciplinary intervention (name on the board, back then), but I definitely made friends after I threw a wet wad of tissue at the ceiling and it stuck there for two weeks. My teacher never paid attention to me when I sat quietly, but she paid attention when I created disruptions. Kids didn't talk to me or invite me to their recess cliques when I was ""A Honor Roll"", but when I returned from suspension, the kids in the class all seemed to like me more and wanted to hear about how I got paddled by the principal.  


It sounds counterintuitive, but in the long run if you focus attentions on the good kids and ignore the bad ones the bad ones will begin to emulate the good ones. Every reaction you give the bad ones reinforces their behavior (even if you see it as punishment). It wasn't until I reached the back half of middle school before I had a teacher that did this and it turned me right 'round."
Middleschoolteachers,"Another perspective on this.....as the adoptive parent of two kids who were severely abused and traumatized and acted out in school and have attachment issues, as much as we wanted alternative placements for them it was very hard to get them, and, depending on the alternative placement, once the kid starts doing well the default is usually to send them back to the regular school. 

This happened to our daughter. Couldn't handle regular school, but did so well in a structured environment for a year and a half that we were heavily pressured to send her to the neighborhood middle school, which was too overstretched to give her the supportive services she needed. 

Due to school stress she started acting out at home again before she did at school so we were stuck with her there, even tho we told the school what was happening. This began a downward spiral where she was arrested at 12 for aggression at home, put into a treatment program where she was sexually assaulted at 14, and at 18 is pregnant, couch surfing and trying to finish her GED 

This is a loving, resilient girl but with a lot of trauma.

Her brother had bad experience too ..we had to do a family move and rather than rely on the 500+ pages of records for his IEP saying he needed a special placement, the new district, as virtually all districts do, insisted that he be placed in the neighborhood highschool so they could assess for themselves, thereby guaranteeing hassle for teachers and other kids and guaranteeing a crash and burn for our emotionally vulnerable son. 

A year and a half later he finally got the placement he needed and now, almost a year after *that*, he is finally coming out of his depression and loves school and is letting his sweetness show again. 

And we are a family that has been praised multiple times for our skill in ""advocating"" and ""navigating the system."" We are white, educated, and middle class and so have all those unfair structural advantages, and the whole experience has still been a nightmare, and we get exhausted and have other stressors in our lives so we can't always parent as well as we want.

I can only begin to imagine how hard it can be for other special needs parents who don't have our resources.

Another thing....finding out about alternative resources is very much on a need to know basis and sometimes not even that because school districts don't want everyone to ask for special  treatment. Also they are mandated to be inclusive so they generally won't suggest an alternative placement even if they are desperate unless the parent beings it up first, which they can't if they don't know about it. 

Imagine my surprise on learning that districts sometimes cover therapeutic boarding schools - that would have been by far a better solution for our daughter than having her arrested for freaking out but we didn't know about it. (Because she had aged out / exhausted the children's mental health crisis resources)

And behavioral needs are not always the parents fault - that is a huge oversimplification. We know  birth parents who have ""that kid"" for reasons out of their control, like lead poisoning for example. 

But parenting difficult children also takes a huge toll so some people who might had done fine parenting an easy child are overwhelmed by the challenge of parenting a difficult one. 

Also, I say this with full love and appreciation for all the educators we have worked with. They were great. Heroic even. Our kids would not be doing as,well as,they are without them. It is the system that sucks. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm 5'1 and I've been mistaken for a student...I teach in a middle school lol.

I feel like you need to read the environment. My hair's been a bright auburn colors for 8 years and I get nothing but compliments, though once it starts to fade it looks more natural. However, we have a female teacher at my school with a nose ring and a male teacher with tattoo sleeves. It just depends on your administration.

Middleschoolteachers,"Note this is a middle school

1. The annoying ones don’t really give half a shit. The only ones that respect the opinions of smart kids are the ones who aren’t issues
2. Public
3. Middle class I think it ranges from low to high without a main concentration 

Any other questions I’m happy to answer any"
Middleschoolteachers,"I remember this to be so true. We had a terrible kid all through middle school in my class and I could see how frustrated every teacher was. One day he was really sick - still being a dick in class but a little slower than normal. Then he threw up all over the desk clump and floor. Sent him to the principals office to call home - neither of his parents would come get him. We didn’t have a nurse office - so the principals office sent him back to class. Where he threw up two more times. Of course he came back to school the next day too - at least he didn’t throw up that day. 

As much of an annoyance as he was - I did feel bad that he wasn’t allowed to be sick at home."
Middleschoolteachers,"when I was a kid (middle school tho) I got put in a special “last chance” class with all the bad kids cuz I kept gettin into trouble. Only went to school 3 hours a day and got to leave at lunch. Honestly tho, it helped me realize that I don’t wanna be with all the fuck ups all the time and getting in hella trouble isn’t cool"
Middleschoolteachers,"I agree to some degree and deffintly in high and middle school. I think I only got one C. From a math teacher who I didn’t really like (as a teacher,  I him liked outside off school when we did are backpacking trip during summer break). But in college I could probably do all A’s if I tried extremely hard but would have to stop working and would probably have a lot of stress.  However that doesn’t mean I’m not trying. I’m defiantly want to graduate with a BA or BS. (they may be change the majors name.  ! I did at my community college and I don’t like getting low grades. But my goal is graduating not having the highest GPA or the highest grades.  That doesn’t mean I don’t get decent grades.  At MPC I did get Some A’s lots of B’s and a few C’s thier were certain class that I did fail (D).  "
Middleschoolteachers,"Hello all. 
Just looking for some advice because the internet can get a little confusing on this subject.  
I am looking to make a career change and my goal is to teach history in a private school setting (preferably middle school) in Massachusetts .  I have a bachelors degree in criminal justice.  Is there any clear  path for me to pursue this goal because I know private schools pretty much play by their own rules.  If anyone can guide me in the right direction feel free to PM me and I can go into greater detail. Thanks a lot in advance   "
Middleschoolteachers,"Rural middle school, ~230 kids in grades 6-8. Over half of the kids are low-income and get free or reduced lunch, and 95% of them ride the bus because the school is out in the middle of nowhere so they can't walk to it. Because of that, having a kid after school for tutoring or a detention is pretty much not going to happen unless you set it up way in advance, and then you have to sit and wait with them to make sure the parent actually shows up to get them instead of thinking they'll come on the bus like usual.

Most of the kids have no college plans. Their folks are blue collar and that's what they plan on as well. Most, anyway. Some have plans to head to the cities when they graduate.

I have small classes, 4 core classes with ~20 kids in each, and 2 electives with about the same. I like it. I get to know my kids really well since there's only 80ish and I usually see some of them more than once each day."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and have 37-minute periods. My answer is simple: ""Is this relevant? No? Great, moving on."""
Middleschoolteachers,"I did this AS a high school student and it was a lot of fun (I’ve taught elementary &amp; middle—middle school we had them act out romeo &amp; juliet and it was a blast!) It’s a great lesson. 


the 6th grade also had a greek mythology day where they dressed up as different gods/goddesses and then presented their research on them as them. that was cool!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Not that I have been able to tell, no. I've had several students who were very clearly high, though, or who reeked of marijuana.

Sadly, I teach middle school."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach PK-8th so not getting into the truly difficult stuff 😀 But I've learned to put off teaching telling time until middle school.  I tried it with 5th graders and it just wasn't worth it.  I would've had to take two months to dedicate to it.  7th graders still struggle a bit, but it's MUCH easier for them!"
Middleschoolteachers,"We had a kid hiding their parents pills in an air vent out of site of the cameras and selling them for a while. Kid was eventually caught and has been expelled...but these middle schoolers do things a lot differently than what I remember. 

Edit: we also had a kid bring pot to school just to show everyone. Kid was caught when we noticed a bunch of people sniffing his hand. Just out there in the middle of the hallway. When the kid was asked what he was thinking, he just said “this is what my mom and her friends do.” "
Middleschoolteachers,"Last year I subbed a lot at a middle school under my main licensure content. The office asked out of desperation if I could cover a SPED teacher for a day. All of the classes she taught only had 6 kids max but man they were a handful, lot of EBD. 

One kid was particularly hard, hated female authority, only really responded well to male authority. Of course as a woman that was problematic. Took it slow and careful, he already hated subs because they would send him to the office. Vowed not to send him to the office unless I couldn’t physically handle him anymore. 

Had him sit right next to me and we worked on his homework together. We talked about Fortnite and his cooking skills. The next day the SPED teacher actually messaged me saying that the boy actually loved me and she requested I sub for her more that year. 

I had a really good time as a SPED sub, really gave me insight into the crazy world of special education and how it operates in public schools. SPED teachers are saints among us mortals. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I started as an elementary Ed major and during my student teaching time I didn’t like my second placement either. My first was 5th grade and second was 1st grade. I dreaded going in everyday as well and was also nervous of losing the spark/drive. Thankfully yours is only for a couple months, just stick it out and try your best! In the “real world” you don’t know what class/placement you’ll get for a whole year let alone a couple months. I teach middle school STEM science now and I have the entire middle school (6-8) and my 7th period genuinely makes me consider this profession as they make me want to cry practically everyday. From not caring to such behavior issues, it is always a nightmare. But I try not to let that one period get in the way of my love for teaching as the other 5 periods I have are much better (for the most part). Try looking towards the positive and now you know maybe middle school isn’t for you! There’s no problem in knowing that either. Hope this helps some!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I didn’t love my middle school placement either but it was a valuable lesson in gritting my teeth and getting through it. I ended up teaching high school, where I felt much more comfortable and generally enjoyed it, but I still would sometimes have a class or a prep or a student that I didn’t like and I was glad I had developed a tough skin and coping mechanisms during a very unenjoyable student teaching placement.

A lot of things are out of your control as an educator. We have administrators or parents or test scores or whatever causing stress every day. It’s a good lesson to learn you can’t control everything but you can control your attitude and how you cope.

Just food for thought!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Unfortunately, we are required to do four large writing assignments in the school year, and each HAS to be graded on all five attributes. These don’t allow grading as you go, as you need the whole paper to see the focus, organization, etc. This is at the middle school level, with only 45 minute classes, and 32 to 36 kids per class. I limit my other grading as much as possible, but these will always be butt kickers."
Middleschoolteachers,"My school piloted the Carnegie program and I personally loved most of the lessons in the beginning, and then it fades.  This was for the Algebra One middle school curriculum.  I found I ran out of time at the end of the year to use their well thought out, but long and detailed lessons.  End up making my own, but still supplement with their extra worksheets.

Just my personal experience."
Middleschoolteachers,"I sass my middle schoolers up and down. I say please and thank you, and they are shocked. I apologize as needed, and they are surprised to see a teacher be humble enough. It helps, a lot. I let the anger go, day to day. And when they've done something inexcusable, I write them up. And they know it, and I like to think at the end of the day... they know I had to. They literally leave you no choice sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I love teaching middle school, because I hated middle school. I know what it feels to be in a classroom with the teacher who was written you off, or just doesn't care, or clearly doesn't enjoy spending time with you. That one hurts. I make it a point to tell them, even when they piss me off, that I enjoy them as people. Students? They need a little work.

&amp;#x200B;

Your most annoying kids? Thank them for the show. Give them the attention they crave. Then take back the focus and turn it around on them. "
Middleschoolteachers,What kind of school is this? No gym or recess for middle schoolers? I agree on a body break in the beginning and maybe end of class? Depending the school you could email the parents and let them know you'll be taking time out of class specifically because the school does not provide recess or gym. I thought most states mandated at least some gym?
Middleschoolteachers,"&gt;Woah, what standard is binder organization?

To be honest with you skills like organization, study habits and time management absolutely should be standards. We (mostly middle school and high school teachers) expect students to have these skills and complain when they don't, but we really don't teach them. Sure, some teachers and schools try to, but it's almost always in a half-assed ""not academic content or part of the curriculum so it doesn't really matter"" way."
Middleschoolteachers,"It is exceedingly frustrating to see elementary and middle school students spending almost all of their ""station"" or ""center"" time trying to log in to the computer and specific program. They would be much better served if they engaged in activities that developed their literacy and oracy skills in ways that are integrated purposefully with whole-group instruction. 

It is even more frustrating to think about the millions of dollars spent on said computer programs and that district leadership sometimes mandates teachers to ensure their students spend a certain amount of time on these programs each day (with limited or messy data to suggest the benefits of such efforts and resource allocation). "
Middleschoolteachers,Why the fuck would you just decide to insult all middle school teachers in one sweeping generalization? My kids don’t have everything done for them and they certainly fail if they choose not to follow directions or hand in their work. Since you don’t teach middle school maybe you don’t know what you’re talking about. 
Middleschoolteachers,"I’ve been coming to this same conclusion slowly and steadily for the last few years. I just started my 7th year, so we’re in a similar place. I think it’s because I’m FINALLY getting the workload under control and I finally have figured out how to plan and teach. Now at this stage we’re able to put more effort into the relationship and management stuff, because we know we’ve done what we can to plan and deliver effective lessons.

I also teach middle school music. General music is where I struggle the most."
Middleschoolteachers,"Man, the fact that you recognize and acknowledge the fact that what she is doing isn't right and you don't want to be that teacher, I'd say you're probably going to be a better one in the long haul if you stick with it. Observe her AND the kids' reactions while she's teaching then go talk to the kids you know are struggling. They'll tell you so much more about how to be a good teacher than she will and that's probably true even if she was an awesome teacher. 

I'm currently in an alternative licensure program at a title I middle school after dropping out of a student teaching program last year. I was struggling and couldnt see past how bad of a match we were. If I could do it again with the perspective I have today, I would have just powered through and asked as many questions I could think of. "
Middleschoolteachers,"This is my approach in middle school because I think it’s the only thing that works in middle school. It’s a strange time for them and they need the freedom to be moody, make mistakes, and be all over the place without being judged. If the same behaviors were exhibited by high schoolers, I’d have a different approach, because they should start being self-motivated and self-regulated by then. "
Middleschoolteachers,"Fifth-year middle school teacher here.

When I first started, I thought classroom management and dealing with behavior was just ""stop talking"" and kicking kids out that misbehaved. Thankfully, I was surrounded by teachers that could guide me a bit more, and now I feel confident about my skills.

That being said, my team can often disagree about the proper behavior management to use with students, but the one through-line for every student is empathy. 

We all tend to agree that ISS and OSS are dumb ideas (unless the student is a danger to others), so making effort to build rapport and trying to see why a student is acting a certain way tends to help, but I think you probably already know this."
Middleschoolteachers,"Siiiiiigh!  I can almost excuse the freshmen (I teach an elective in addition, and it's pretty much 25/25/25/25), since they've been taught in middle school to just ... whine until someone does everything for them, and there's generally no possibility of failure.

Also, here's what I do to keep from having to do notebook checks:  I give ""notebook quizzes"" -- and the quizzes are very specific so that they can't pass the quiz without a complete notebook (open notebook, of course)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Luckily their behavior and obnoxiousness doesn’t bother me so much as I’m pretty even-tempered. They’re very likeable kids as well! It just takes 2x as long to complete tasks &amp; I worry about falling behind. 
But I’ll be on the lookout. 

As a middle school teacher tables were never an option  and while I thought the age gap teaching children 4-5 years older would solve some problems it evidently is very similar!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Some kids still haven't developed socail skills, others are just alone cause kids are cruel.  Finding a way to boost their confidence would be the best way to go.  Although, sometimes, it comes down to home life.  Some kids don't have it well at home, and they bring that with them to school.  Students are very observant and can pick up on the the kid being different.  

That being said, I have seen a lot of improvement with middle schoolers since I was one.  They're way more accepting now."
Middleschoolteachers,"When I was in middle school I had this teacher named mr. Ben, me, my friends and him were pretty close, he was all out favorites, he'd talk to us and tell us stories and give advice, and he'd be able to put things into perspective for you. And I really got to know him and it was awesome, he felt more like a friend than a teacher and was kinda of a father figure tbh which was something that not all kids need but something I needed then."
Middleschoolteachers,Doesn't matter I student taught at a high school and got hired at a middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,"I just got home from a three hour home visit with a family and another teacher, and it was such a great home visit. The student is one of what I call my repeat students (I had her in third, and now in fifth grade), and she's one of my all-time favorites. Her parents are great too. And they said so many things that made me feel so good. At one point when I was explaining something, the mom cut me off and said that her daughter has adopted so many of my mannerisms and way of speaking, and she sees it when her daughter is explaining things. They also said that she had a rough time in fourth grade and were thinking about moving her schools, but when they heard I was the fifth grade teacher, they decided to keep her at our school because they had such a great experience with me in third grade, and then joked that I needed to let them know if I wanted to teach middle school next year so their daughter could go there. I've never been so flattered in my life. 

We were having such great conversation that they invited us to stay for dinner and ordered food for us. It was the perfect way to end a hectic week. "
Middleschoolteachers,I have officially finished my first quarter as a high school math teacher! It’s so much more relaxed than the three years I taught at a middle school before. It’s amazing. I’m pretty happy with this change so far. 
Middleschoolteachers,"Every time you drastically change positions it is like a new 1st year.  Think of it like that and run with it.

Last year I moved from HS to middle school and also changed the material I was teaching. For a variety of reasons, it ended up as the worst of my 7 years, including my first. Had I used this mindset, I probably would have enjoyed myself slightly more."
Middleschoolteachers,"I've had parents say the same thing when kids move into my class as freshmen.  Every single time I've asked for clarification, what it comes down to is that they were expecting the same questions - like, exact same. Turns out several of middle school teachers use homework questions on quizzes (very lightly re-worded, if at all), then again on tests, and then again on the semester exams. I now spend a great deal of time on the syllabus, back-to-school night, and first days of school explaining that I don't ever reuse the same questions, that students need to study the original material and notes, not just their ""packets"" (i don't have words for how much i loathe that word), and then I give a whole lot of info about ways to study. It's not a matter of alignment, types of questions, etc. etc. for my kids, it's that they genuinely have no idea how to study and are essentially lost if they don't have the questions ahead of time. It's a lot of work to undo bad middle school habits every year, but they do catch on eventually."
Middleschoolteachers,"Used to work college level, now middle school level. 

You’re overestimating college students. "
Middleschoolteachers,"I think this is great advice but not all that realistic. I taught at a very rough middle school in the area. I hated every minute of it. The kids were rude, unmotivated, disrespectful, would curse me out daily, steal from me, call me names, throw things, it was the fucking worst. These students were truly the bottom of the barrel. 
I very much wanted to be the person who “wouldn’t give up” no matter how hard they pushed. But in the end, my role in their lives was very limited. The hour or so I saw them per day would never have even been enough to outweigh the influence of their home lives...their peers....etc. 

I hate to put it this way but some of these kids are already fucked. In middle school, they don’t seem to care about anything.....do nothing but disrupt the classroom environment....constantly combative.....will not take direction....its over for them. The world does not reward people who engage in those behaviors. Their parents have failed them. The community has failed. Of course I don’t want to be another person who has just given up but there’s little I can do to intervene once the student is that far down in the wrong direction."
Middleschoolteachers,This is why I chose middle school instead of HS. I did not want multiple preps or the chance I'd be changing subjects each year. I don't know how HS teachers do it!!!
Middleschoolteachers,"Education is trendy. Collaboration is the big thing right now, it’ll change. Especially in middle school. We have the interesting situation of MS admin meshing elementary and high school education trends. "
Middleschoolteachers,Ours get the task of supervising during lunch. At a middle school I’d quit if I had to do that. 
Middleschoolteachers,"That's exciting!  I'm a certified ESOL Teacher, but love teaching math, too!  I'm currently out of the classroom, but if I go back, I will seek middle school math positions.

Are you a Praxis state?  In my state you only need an original teaching license and you can add endorsements for other subjects by taking praxis.  My certificate is k-12, so I only had to take the middle school math content one.  However, if you don't have the same grade levels, you can take like both the content and pedagogy Praxis tests to meet that requirement.

If you're going to get another teaching degree anyway, it would likely be beneficial to do something related to math education, however, having that certification may allow you to switch subjects now.  My state was always in need of math teachers.  I think teaching the subject while you learn about it in grad school can make grad school more effective in impacting your actual teaching.  You have a lot more experiences to reflect upon and discuss with classmates.

By the way, I also just got a student to tutor in high school Geometry and it is amazing!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I don’t know about your state, but in my state the Vice Principal (athletic director)  or some other Admin is required to be in campus during extracurriculars and remain until all students are gone. That’s not your job, especially considering you’re an AC. You and the other should be rotating responsibilities for athletes not specific to your coaching area.  Also, I know Texas football (my hubbs is from there), but 30-40 hours/practice for middle school students is obscene. The focus is an education, not winning games. I see how many of these parents live their childhood/NFL dreams vicariously through their kids and it’s disgusting to see parents do that to their children. I would really see about who is to be on campus and when. That is admins job and they get paid to do it. If parents don’t show up in time, habitually (significant wait-time), that’s a call to CPS. I would have those kids telling their parents they need to be there 15 minutes earlier and call them before the game/practice is over to remind them to pick them up (I hate late parents/people- teachers have a life too)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Two words, classroom management. I had content classes, lesson planning classes, assessment planning classes, nothing prepared me for a room of 30+ pre-teen jerks who don’t want to be there and think my content is a waste of their time.  (For clarity I. Love those jerks but middle school kids are 80% jerk. With a human core in the middle that is starting to learn how to show itself)"
Middleschoolteachers,"Now.  You should apply for jobs now.  Now I don't know every state or school.  But I know from hiring at my current school and my last you have a few things going against you.  1) You are applying for an English position which usually have a larger number of applicants.  2) While you have teaching experience, it is with a different age group (and it is a completely different experience) so there are likely more experienced applicants than you  3)Your experience is at a charter and not at a public school so it isn't considered to be equal experience.  

You may not get the job you want right away.  You can obviously keep applying to high school positions, but I would consider applying to middle school ones as well because that cancels out point 2 against you. 

Also, if you have an attitude in the interview that middle school is a 'lower standard' than high school, it could be turning off interviewers."
Middleschoolteachers,"As a HS counselor, all I can say is that kids don’t magically end up in high school. They spend YEARS (literally) in K-8. The foundation they come into HS with is extremely important for their overall success. Getting a job at the elementary or middle school level is probably more - not less- important. Getting a job at the MS is not “lowering” standards. Try again..."
Middleschoolteachers,"Passing over the shitty ""middle school is less valuable,"" it's a numbers game.

*Then again, maybe your interviewers can smell the elitism...*"
Middleschoolteachers,"Obviously not! Look, I’m a middle school teacher! I work exceptionally hard and I’m good at my job! It’s just that when it comes to applying to positions, I have a list of personal standards. It’s criteria I’m looking for. I’m sorry my wording offended you but I’m trying to get the point across that for me, taking a middle school job is settling."
Middleschoolteachers,"I understand that.  I can still think of a dozen ways to frame this in a way that isn’t negative toward middle school teachers. 

I hope you didn’t mention middle school being beneath your standards in any interviews."
Middleschoolteachers,"Kinda rude that you frame middle school as “lowering your standards” rather than just not the best fit for you.  Words matter, and yours seem poorly chosen."
Middleschoolteachers,I’m not in it for the money though. I just really don’t abt to teach middle school any more
Middleschoolteachers,Apply to everything and take the best job you get.  High school pays the same as middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,"My licensure is Earth Science 7-12 in NYS. I teach middle school general science, which is a mixture of different sciences. I had no issue finding a general science job with my license, but you are typically competing against biology certified teachers (nearly every MS teacher is biology in my experience). My grad school peers mostly went into high school and found jobs without too much trouble because of the Regents, so Earth Science is offered at many schools but not many people are certified.  It’s common for biology certified teachers to be given earth science. I don’t know about other states but in NY there is definitely demand for Earth Science, but there’s more demand for chem/physics."
Middleschoolteachers,"That’s what I’m thinking. My contract also allows me to take the whole year off (without pay after my sick days and paying for my own health insurance) and come back to a job, but not necessarily my current position. I love my current position (middle school band), but since I’m K-12 certified, I could end up teaching elementary general music, which I would have no idea how to teach. Really keeping my fingers crossed for remote learning in the fall. I feel selfish, but if I worry it’s not safe for me, then it’s certainly not safe for students either."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have no recommendations for books but will happily share my experience.

First, I'm curious what level of buy-in will you have from your colleagues, admin, and district? That will define your experience. I'm in a district that is moving 100% to SBG in an entirely top-down fashion, so my experience will be vastly different from someone who is moving to SBG in their own classroom out of their own genuine curiosity. I don't know how to distinguish between ""standards based grading"" and ""my own district's application of standards based grading,"" so forgive me if I say something that's specific to my district and needs additional context. Feel free to ask questions and I'll be happy to follow up.

In my district, we are moving to get to the point where all ages K–12 will have their grades be entirely based on standards. In the elementary and middle schools, we are abolishing letter grades altogether, but in high school, we are keeping letter grades to maintain compatibility with the rest of the nation (but are pushing to have those grades be tied to standards instead of whatever a teacher may choose).

We use the standard 4-tiered scale. The first thing is to learn that this is not a 4 *point* scale. Everyone wants to treat them as ""points"" which is wrong and frustrating to deal with. Correcting students' and parents' incorrect intuition will become your life.

* Level 1: No mastery
* Level 2: Partial mastery
* Level 3: Meets expectations (the goal)
* Level 4: Advanced/mastery

Expect absolutely no buy-in from parents whatsoever. Especially if you're doing it on your own, make sure either (1) you are simply dipping your toes in the water and not upending the traditional grading model too much, or (2) you are an untouchable veteran teacher willing to make this the hill you die on. Grading is such a huge part of education, for better or for worse, and SBG rocks the boat well beyond an amount that gets the attention of every single parent and student.

Expect very difficult conversations with every single kind, hard-working, straight-A student. We all have *tons* of straight-A students who are used to ""playing the game"" of school—they know how to turn work in on time, complete test corrections after their tests, resubmit assignments for additional points back, whatever. They're not used to being told that they're currently sitting at a level-3 understanding on a 4-level scale, representing that they have met expectations in a standard but have not reached mastery. They will interpret that to mean that they are being given a 75%, even though they did all of the work they've been asked to do, which they see as unfair. (Their entire educational career until that point has taught them the importance of ""playing the game"" which is the craft that they've mastered, so I have sympathy with them—yes, it really is unfair.)

When discussing SBG with colleagues, admin, or parents, expect for every single person to want to use the conversation as an opportunity to shoehorn in their own philosophy on grades, and expect everyone to be using different definitions of things and interpreting everything differently. Have you ever listened to two people discuss politics, and one person says ""socialism is bad, just look at Venezuela"" and the other person says ""socialism is good, just look at Finland,"" and you've thought to yourself ""um, I think you guys might be using two different definitions of the word 'socialism,' but that's none of my business?"" No one will have the same philosophical understanding of what a ""level 3"" is or what a ""level 4"" is. People will want to spend the bulk of the conversation talking about their own philosophies on grading instead of working towards a shared definition of what is meant by ""level 3"" or ""level 4.""

If admin gets involved, expect clueless implementations that completely miss the point. I've had an administrator tell an entire school that all teachers *must* tie all grades directly to standards, and simultaneously tell an entire school that we *must* reduce the numbers of D's and F's. These are completely, 100% contradictory. A huge feature of SBG is that it takes grading decisions out of teachers' hands and ties it to more universal standards. The admin team literally ran reports of which teachers had the most F's and would confront them about it.

&gt; &gt; Why do you have so many students on track to fail this quarter?
&gt; 
&gt; Because I've adopted the standards and rubrics set forth by my department, and all of these students are objectively at a 'level 1' according to those rubrics. Maybe it's a terrible class, or maybe I'm a bad teacher compared to my colleagues. Either way, these students are objectively at a 'level 1' (here are the assessments to prove it) and their performance is being assessed in the exact same way as other students, so even if it's a bit worrisome, it's at least fair and consistent which is a major goal/feature of SBG.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You need to give fewer F's.

That same admin team also unilaterally created a scale that said that a ""level 3"" should translate to a ""B,"" with no input from teachers or the community and with no consistency among other schools. This is a deep philosophical issue about what a grade *should* represent (if you have to have them at all); instead of being discussed at-length by all stakeholders, the answer was drafted up in an afternoon and thrown onto all teachers. There are many other philosophical discussions to be had, and none of them will be had.

Expect to have difficulty with classroom behavior without being able to use grades as a carrot/stick, at least until you figure out a new paradigm. No extra credit, no participation points, no points off for late work. Philosophically it's perhaps not ideal to have to tie those things to a grade, but for better or for worse every teachers has managed student behavior by using their classroom grades. IMO grades have historically been an important tool for teacher autonomy—*you* get to pick *your* grading philosophy based on how *you* teach, how *you* assess, how *you* manage student behavior, etc. If there are new expectations thrown on you, your grading philosophy can be adjusted to incorporate the new stuff. But by tying grades to only standards, everything else about your teaching needs to find a new way to be enforced. If you can't lower a student's homework score when they refuse to do homework, what are you going to do instead to motivate that student? Odds are it requires a cohesive approach from the entire school, or district, or community, and it *certainly* means you need admin or counseling to be on your side when you have an issue with a student. It also means much more work on your end. Instead of just lowering the kid's grade, you now need to loop in all the kid's other teachers, counseling, parents, etc. to find a new solution. Maybe that's a good thing—it forces those types of issues to come to the forefront so that they can actually be addressed, but it requires an incomprehensible amount of time. I would estimate that the average teacher at our school spends maybe an hour peer week before/after school in intervention meetings with counselors/parents/admin/etc. to address things like a student's late work habit or whatever else. (Keep in mind we're talking about squeezing many meetings per week into short amounts of time before/after school, so any time you have a meeting that means you won't be getting anything else done that morning or afternoon. Do you ever make copies in the morning? Not anymore you don't.) It's a hell of a lot more time than we get per week to sit down with our PLCs. It's also just not as effective as simply giving partial credit for late work or giving a certain number of late passes per quarter or something.

I think I'm probably approaching the character limit so I'll stop there. Overall my impression is quite negative on moving an entire district to it and I think it's a solution looking for a problem. Let teachers grade how they want to grade, or abolish grades altogether, and put the tens of thousands of dollars of saved consultant fees towards hiring another teacher."
Middleschoolteachers,"I’m worried too. I teach elementary music and middle school chorus. I have no idea what I will do with middle school if we can’t have a concert! Also, I can’t imagine doing elementary without them moving around a lot. I hope we don’t have to take all the fun out of our class!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I enjoy teaching To Kill a Mockingbird and The Tell-Tale Heart. I'd love to teach Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, The Glass Castle, or a Raisin in the Sun. In middle school, I loved Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. In high school, I enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, and couldn't believe they'd actually let us read a book with gay characters (the 90s were a dark time)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Thank you for telling me about your experiences. It is very valuable to hear about it, and I find your perspective on teaching being more about the pedagogy than the content a good perspective to take even though I don't often think about it that way. Being in an elementary school really gave you new challenges and changed your perspective on literacy, and it made you able to work with many different varieties of students.

As to why I don't want to do elementary, I value being able to teach in a way that allows the students to develop their ability to show insight into what they are learning and make new discoveries through the research and inquiry process. I want to go into depth about what we are covering and make the topics come alive to the students. I do not want to spend my instructional time singing songs, playing games, and doing social-emotional activities that aren't relevant to what we are learning. In addition, I want to be able to give students the opportunity to participate in the learning process and creatively displaying their knowledge, something I don't think they can do sophisticatedly at the lower elementary level. I'm against patronizing students in any way, which I think is necessary at times at the elementary level because they don't have the attention span to focus on lessons in the same way that middle school and high school students do. 

But to some extent, my dislike could be because I don't really know what they do in elementary (especially K-3) outside of my experiences as a student 11-16 years ago, talking to my former neighbor's children, and brief chats with customers who have young kids at my grocery store job. I have had roughly 15 hours of observation in an urban elementary school library before. The students were very rowdy and the school librarian was perhaps a little too strict with them. I did not like the experience. I enjoyed the 10 hour urban middle school and 10 hour suburban high school observation I did, plus the two weeks of observation I did at another suburban high school right before COVID-19 shut everything down. I expect my student teaching placement department will put me with an elementary school library at least part of the time to build broader teaching experiences (and also because they know I don't like it and they want to push me out of my comfort zone a little bit), so I recognize my assessment might change."
Middleschoolteachers,"I went through middle school in the 80s and we had a collection of short stories that they used in 8th grade I want to say that contained a bunch of O’Henry, the stories you list, and a few more that were made into movies and radio scripts like War of the Worlds, The Veldt, and Leiningen Versus the Ants (made into The Naked Jungle, which was a ridiculous Charlton Heston movie).

I try to work in as many as I can with my students but some of the concepts are dated or the kids really don’t get it these days..like The Lottery."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach in a middle school in NYC. I would like to see 5th and 6th graders in on a couple days and 7th and 8th in on the other days. Another option is possibly only having the lower grades come in and do mostly distance learning with students old enough to stay home. I say this with a heavy heart as I love teaching in person so much more.

The building I’m in holds three different schools with over 2,000 students and about 150-200 staff members. I’ve been racking my brain on how social distancing is possible in my building but I finally landed on alternating days by grade.

In NYC, if we don’t have most people staying home, mass transit will have millions of people daily and could overwhelm the hospital system again until there is a vaccine."
Middleschoolteachers,"I’d say at most schools be ready to put your time in...if you can walk into a school right away and teach AP with just middle school experience, it’s likely you don’t want to teach at that school.

You also named to take the summer institute classes.

But I have to say, just saying “I wanna teach AP classes...” with no subject area or anything is kinda a weird request...why just AP?"
Middleschoolteachers,"I did it when I taught middle school except I did keep the same kids. They stayed together, mostly, from k-8."
Middleschoolteachers,"In general, and in most states, science teachers are commonly in demand. The fact that you have science degree instead of a teaching degree also helps in case teaching does not work out for you, or if you want to leave the profession.

Depending on the grade level you want to teach at, will most likely mean you will have to get a credential/certification in a specific field of science. At the middle school level we are teaching more foundational science versus at the high school level where it is more focus on either life, earth, or physical science. Though I have been at high schools where they did not care which science specialty you had as long as you have some kind of science content background and can teach other science areas. 

You might want to also jump to /r/scienceteachers"
Middleschoolteachers,"It's extremely hard not to move onto the next grade in elementary and middle school in my district. In some situations, you need explicit consent of the parent to retain their kid, which is never going to happen.

The real wake up call occurs freshman year, and now graduating and moving on depends on their grades. So a kid that fell behind in elementary school and completely fucked around in middle school is now trying to tackle high school level work with an elementary school education."
Middleschoolteachers,My former NJ colleagues (in a few different districts) told me they have a virtual ceremony already planned. One did a middle school move up last week and one has the HS virtual grad ceremony in the works because parents didn’t want their kids getting together with others and getting sick and they didn’t feel comfortable (overwhelmingly according to the numbers) sitting in an auditorium or football field. The teachers were relieved to participate virtually.
Middleschoolteachers,"To answer the question about what to do instead. First, you should have access to health records and for older students, ask them using a confidential form when you get other info, so you know about food restrictions.

How about a food that can have a look-a-like alternate- cup cake made with rice flour  instead of wheat. Or give everyone choices of two or three things.

Or food alternates:
Stickers are pretty universal- even college students and the harder to please middle schoolers like them, although the later won’t admit it.

Cheap silly toys- plastic spin tops, pull back cars- to give out or just use in class and you can even have competitions. 

Time- a get out of homework pass or 1/2 homework pass (if they test well, maybe they don’t need the homework), extra free time.

School supplies- fun pencil/pen, highlighter, sticky notes, fun eraser.

Give a coupon for a test point for future test, first choice of recess toy, or homework late pass.

Wheel of fortune type spinner with low or no cost prizes-use ideas above. 

I personally prefer to build in rewards- finish your work and get free choice and celebrating without food- game play, but food is a big part of various cultures, so I understand including it."
Middleschoolteachers,"I've got one from years ago when I first started teaching.

1- I left med school to teach and was working in a private middle school school so I was pretty much learning everything on the job (aka the hard way).  So three months in we're going over a test in class, and after it's done kid says I misgraded his test enough to move it from a B- to an A.  Long story short he used a different color pen on the new answers that were the correct ones I some how missed.  I showed the test to my mentor teacher and he said yes that's cheating.  I ask the student to come and see me after school about the test and he never comes.  Then out of the blue a month later the parents show up demanding I take a lie detector test with his friend at the FBI because I some how erased the student's correct answers with incorrect ones.  I was speechless but my principal told them we do not treat teachers like that and sent me out with orders to take a long weekend to deal with the stress of it all.  I never heard from those parents again."
Middleschoolteachers,"The best way to handle that would be to as someone else said keep middle school and high school students at distance learning and use all of their facilities as elementary classrooms. That would dramatically help with the reduction of class sizes and deal with the childcare issue (maybe also have those older students with special needs also come in for that reason). Of course, in order to do that we’d need a much bigger budget in order to hire a bunch more staff (which will probably only be temporary since they’ll be gone more or less once we go back to normal). So I don’t see that happening."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was torn between Elementary and Secondary History.

My college advisor asked if I could potentially coach and if I couldn’t to go the elementary route.

I couldn’t see myself having “the right stuff” to coach so now I teach 5th grade!

(Oddly, I actually ended up coaching middle school sports as an assistant for a couple of years and learned a lot about that!)"
Middleschoolteachers,"Social studies was always my favorite subject growing up and I had some particularly great social studies teachers who inspired me to take the jump into education. 

I didn’t set out to become a middle school teacher. I always envisioned myself teaching high school but student taught and then long term subbed in 8th grade. Learned how to work with and enjoy the age group so I tailored my job search process toward middle schools and hopped on my first offer which was a vacancy in 7th grade."
Middleschoolteachers,"Out of curiosity, why are you so dead-set against elementary?

I ask because when I first started looking for teaching jobs, I was sure that I wanted to teach high school ELA or Social Studies, but would unenthusiastically accept 8th grade - definitely not younger. I wanted to teach content that excited me - whether it be history with nuance or texts with depth. I wanted material to spark deep, Socratic discourse. 

My training year, I was placed into 6th grade ELA. The following year, I was moved into 4th grade Reading. That was five years ago, and I'm still doing that (though I added Writing into the fold this year). Why? Well, one thing I've learned is that, no matter the name of your subject, *your* field of study is *how kids learn it*. 

In the case of elementary ELA, thats litera*cy*. By high school, at least insofar as the standards are concerned, that's more litera*ture*. Coming out of college, I was certain that my interest in the former far exceeded my interest in the latter. Now, it's the reverse: litera*cy* is a massive, terrible, beautiful, dark and deep monster full of utterly fascinating mystery and challenge. 

I teach fourth grade, and, after several years of seeing younger students from afar, I'm comfortable saying that I would prefer not to teach younger than that. Also, after a year in a middle school, I'm comfortable saying that I would prefer to not teach sixth grade again, and probably not seventh, either. I do still have some curiosity about eighth grade and above, but would only pursue such a change if/when I become bored with 4th grade or simply fed up with the direction my district academics team has been going. (From what I can tell, students and content in fifth grade are pretty similar to those in 4th, but where I am, 5th is middle school, and I wouldn't want to make such a drastic environmental change without getting to experience new content and pedagogy.)

However, even if I *do* end up switching to high school, I can say one thing with certainty, with regard to my time in elementary: I'll be a better teacher for it."
Middleschoolteachers,"Firstly, I teach in Norway. I chose subjects based on what I liked in school myself. English, Social studies/Civics and History, and I'm currently studying Religion, philosophies of life and ethics (mandatory subject elementary and middle school and one year in high school). I chose to teach high school because I think I connect well with teens/young adults. But the main reasoning is that I don't have the guts to teach younger kids, I don't want to mess up the kids' basic learning. I'd rather try to ""fix"" some else's messes and/or put the finishing touches on the gems the kids are before I send them out into the world ☺️ 

As I teach at a vocational high school, I only teach English and Social studies/Civics. History is part of the supplementary course for those students who change their mind, and want to go to a university. And Religion (RPE) is a subject at the university prep courses. But, I've applied for positions at other schools in those subjects, so fingers crossed."
Middleschoolteachers,I didn't choose. It was just the job I got. I did all my student teaching in elementary school and ended up teaching middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,"I love math. And I taught at a middle school and they wanted me to decorate the walls in themes. Seemed very silly to me and I know these students are coming from an elementary school, so I'm teaching high school now. They still want me to decorate the walls, but at least they don't expect childish themes."
Middleschoolteachers,"Greatly depends on the area, I'm in Texas. Here, it is directly related to your campus level, middle school principals and APs make more than elementary, and high school makes more than middle school. APs also can be 11 month, 11.5 month, or 12 month which will affect pay. A 12 month elementary AP would start around 65k, while a high school AP would start around 76k. Elementary principals would start around 85k, and high school principals would start around 105k. Find the middle ground between the two and that's where middle schools are."
Middleschoolteachers,"The school I worked at this year and for the past seven years is so like this. They play a favorites game and decide who they want to make so miserable they leave, and they harassment manage you until you have a nervous breakdown and quit the next year. I was the one on their shit list this year, they tried at the end of last year too I tried to leave then but wasn't successful at lining up another job, and damn right I'm leaving this year. I was going to leave whether I had a job or not. They made my life hell this year. Yes I realize they got their way, but I am so happy with the job I have lined up next year I don't even care. I'll be an elementary librarian next year, instead of middle school STEM (a mandatory elective that they got rid of writing instruction for... yeah writing was replaced by a project based class)."
Middleschoolteachers,"Student here: My school has a policy that states that if you turn in a paper after the marking period is over, it doesn't get counted (exceptions being in place for people with IEPs and 504s and the such). It just becomes a zero in the grade book, and nobody can do anything about it. At least, that's our high school and middle school's rules. It might be different for elementary I guess, but I didn't pay attention to policy back then."
Middleschoolteachers,"That's why I went with the math minor!  I knew it would be harder to find a job teaching English even though that's what I'd prefer.  I wanted to keep my options open. The principal at the high school I substituted at last year said was crazy for going for both, but that I better give her a call, so I probably ought to do that. I did substitute a lot in the English department I want to work in this last year though (same school), and I know there is an opening or two, so I'm really hoping I can get in there. 

 I already passed the 4-8 math certification because my alt-cert program didn't offer the 7-12, so maybe having the middle school cert will give the high school some amount of confidence I can pass the high school one as well.  I guess I could also teach middle school, but I really wouldn't prefer that.  As a first year teacher and alternative candidate at that, I won't be too picky though.  Any job in my preferred district is probably a winner."
Middleschoolteachers,"Ultra conservative Catholic mom who came from a family that was insanely sexist (we’re talking the kind of family that the men sat at the table and women served the men and sat on buckets outside the perimeter of the table). Her son was in my middle school class and HE DID NO WRONG despite what I would tell her - he called other girls in class bitches, made sexist comments, told us we’re going to hell for reading our science textbooks, and even convinced another student to trick me into going into the technology room as part of an end of the year prank where they tried to tie me up in duct tape and restrain me in the room. This mom tried to tell me to excuse her son from any reading because of Lent, denied any of her child’s wrong doing, blamed everything on the other students, would not discipline her child, asked that we start a boxing class so her child could just get his aggression out on the other kids, and with the end of year prank incident she said I made it up and probably had it coming. She would say all this while trying to portray a demure, sweet nature. 

She tried to get me fired during a board meeting open forum and ended up pulling her son out of school the next year. I joined the union after that board meeting! Last I heard, her son was enrolled in my current district’s alternative education high school. Which is too bad, because he was very bright. I’m sure his mommy’s coddling and his behavior is what turned him down that alternative path. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I’m no longer in that district, but in the neighboring district that takes the students from my previous district once they exit 8th grade (the prior district I worked at only goes K-8.)

Edit: wording/clarity"
Middleschoolteachers,"Another time, I was a middle school social studies teacher. We had a young lady in the 8th grade who had some anger issues. She would often lash out at students. she got into fights and she was caught stealing from a teacher's purse ones. We also found that sometimes she would show up to school under the influence.

 So we were in second semester and had just gotten back from the winter vacation when this young lady got into an altercation. She got into a fight with a 7th grader who had, apparently, looked at her secret crush  in a way that made the 8th grader unhappy. The angry eighth grade student then started to pummel the 7th grade student with her fists and literally ripped out chunks of the girls hair from her scalp.

So the student was suspended for a week even though her mother was hollering so loud that everyone in the office could hear her that it was self-defense because her daughter was protecting her man and just marking her territory.

 fast forward a week. The student is back and weird things start happening. The nurse is inundated with a dozen different students were complaining to feel sick. Other students are sitting in class and appear to be high. It turns out that this wonderful 8th grade girl Upon returning from suspension decided to distribute marijuana laced candy to her friends and classmates. She admitted that she was attempting to set up a market for the stuff and make some money.

Her mother was called into the school as was the police. When the mother got there she went off on the principle, the assistant principal and me, since I was the one who busted her, about how mad she was at the situation. She wasn't mad at what her daughter had done. She was mad because we turned over what was left of the marijuana candy to the police. Marijuana was illegal in our state at the time. She went on a massive rant about how we had no right to give her candy over to the police just because her daughter gave some to other students. She also stated that it's not her daughter's fault that some of the other kids, as young as 5th graders, couldn't handle the stuff.

The student was expelled and the mother was not happy. She called in her brother, the girl's uncle, to come and yell at us. He came in reeking of weed. Even Cheech and Chong would tell this guy to lay off the weed of it. He came in yelling about his niece being suspended and how we had to convince the police to give back the candy. The principal called the police and instead of requesting the candy back, the two adults were escorted off campus and told them if they were turned they would be arrested."
Middleschoolteachers,My middle school had the “caught being good” program. The reward was a chocolate chip cookie on Friday afternoon. I was very bummed that I was never chosen/recognized. I was an overachieving perfectionist with a perfect behavior record. I guess it was the same mentality. No need to recognize those that always choose to do the right thing.
Middleschoolteachers,"We had a very short lived reward system in my middle school that the kids with behavior issues got to choose a prize (like a full sized bag of doritos) and they had to carry a behavior tracking sheet to be signed by each teacher.  If they didn't have many behavior incidents over the week they got their prize.  It worked short term for some of the kids--and I think we knew that going in--but the kids that were routinely good were ready to mutany.  

Like, I literally overheard one group making plans.  I didn't think they would follow through (I can't remember what they were planning, nothing too awful, just like throwing water balloons or something), but I still spoke to them."
Middleschoolteachers,"\#3 all the way.  I can't say it was the only reason, but I had a great relationship with one of my middle school students that moved in halfway through first semester, who hadn't been to school yet since he was expelled from his previous school, in foster care, etc. 

I talked to him at a football game, he gave me his story, and I said ""Well, we're happy to have you.""  I personally think that small act made all the difference.  He still attempted to push my boundaries (as most students will) but he didn't give me near the grief he gave to other teachers."
Middleschoolteachers,"There will be one (two maybe) teachers in SDC room, along with an aide, who is only part time. That teacher will teach the core subject of ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies at a more scaffolded and slower pace. Your child will have more time to ask questions and get one on one help. If your child excels in any of these subjects, it will be brought up in an IEP that they would like to try transitioning them for inclusion in that subject. If they push in to a Reg Ed subject, often the aide will sit with them at least 2-3 days per week. If they get an elective, that will be a different teacher, and the IEP will outline the accommodations and modifications that teacher must make, including grading policies. The aide may or may not help out in an elective. PE will also be a different teacher, but because of scheduling any other students in the same grade level that are also in SDC will have the same PE class. The aide does not help out in PE at all. Also there are usually only 12-16 students in SDC (sometimes 8!) but regular middle school classrooms in CA run from 30-36."
Middleschoolteachers,When corrected grades were done by hand I used to submit them and tell the middle school principal to correct it in HIS handwriting.
Middleschoolteachers,"Kids humor is not as developed. What I thought were hilarious YouTube videos in high school and middle school now seem completely inane.

On the flip side there are some TV shows that I now find funny, whereas I used to not get it. 

Don't get me wrong, once in a while a student will hot the nail on the head and crack me up. But a lot of their humor is.. not as developed."
Middleschoolteachers,"We have 2 grades, ‘proficient’ and ‘not yet’ gotta love middle school being so much nicer..."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school precisely because I enjoy interacting with the students. Their jokes are hilarious, and they seem to enjoy my dry sarcasm."
Middleschoolteachers,My best English teacher in middle school had a ponytail. Older dude. Beard. I sure hope no one judged him based on that alone - he was amazing. The first teacher who ever called my parents just to say something positive.
Middleschoolteachers,"I find my middle school students to be hilarious, though I can't let them know that I think they're funny if the jokes are inappropriate. A young teacher like me has to keep an air of professionalism or else lose command of respect. This is why my jokes to them are mainly PG rated."
Middleschoolteachers,"Just be careful, if she's ever breaking away from their crap, you might wanna be careful with that. Some parents can be pretty f\*cked up in their heads and they might take their anger out on their lil girl or you. Some colleagues of mine in middle school had to deal with parents or big brothers threatening them for the stupidest things ever : guns threat (I live in France so this is not a common thing), parents who jumped the person speaking to them and sending them to the hospital, insults and many more. 

But when it comes to children, you can't really know cause the damages done by the parents can be pretty insidious. A kid in the school I was in last year had been thrown out of his own house by his mother and he wouldn't tell anyone cause he didn't wanted the others to think of him as a hobo. 

Parents can be the biggest assholes sometimes, be careful."
Middleschoolteachers,"Okay, here's a long-ass answer. Calculus was invented about 50 years after the invention by Descartes of the Cartesian coordinate system, and really made popular and known about 80 years after, almost exactly 300 years ago. Descartes literally invented the graph of the polynomial. 

It's hard for us to understand how *separate* the disciplines were. In the 1000 years prior, geometry had settled into being a proofs based system with a fairly understood sequence for teaching. This was used as training for priests, and the upper class, and represented a fundamental belief in *certainties*. 

When they asked, ""How many angels could dance on the head of a pin?"", this was a *real* question that they thought would allow them to use the absolute dictates of an internally coherent logical system to make statements about the physics and understanding of the universe. Descartes' *cogito* uses this kind of mapping from internal ideation to external validity to round off the stumbling fourth step of the cogito. 

* I think therefore I am

* I am, therefore I must be in *something*

* I can imagine a perfect benevolent God. 

* Because I can imagine perfection, therefore perfection, and therefore God, exists. 

* and because he's a benevolent God, he wouldn't leave me to be a brain in a jar, and so therefore the world exists. 

* I think --&gt; therefore reality exists. 

Anyway, long story longer: The rise and development of Al-Jebra rose out of trading and Silk Road, so think Marco Polo (13th century). By the writing of Descartes, it's had about three centuries to percolate outwards, and upwards in class. However, it's still seen as very dirty, lower class. Think of how a priest might feel about the mathematics of a merchant CPA. Separate. 

Along comes Descartes, and says, ""well what if we try placing plane geometry - which has only two tools, the compass (fixed distance) and the straight edge. It does NOT have angles ratios, in the trigonometric sense, though certain triangle ratios have been explored in proofs. So this is the birth of **analytic geometry** and **functions**. 

50 years later, *using that new tool*, Isaac Newton and Liebnitz begin to consider limit functions as instantaneous rates of change. *Out* of that - not before, trigonometry is developed to what we think of as trig in 1745. 

So now you have **algebra**, specifically equation solving, and a new discipline, *analytic geometry*, and now a **new** discipline, **trigonometry**. 

Once you had studied each of these, in depth, you could begin to understand Newton's Calculus, and by the time of the birth of trig several hundred people or more could do Calculus, with more becoming interested all the time. 

Now let's look at the state of education. In the world of the 17th century, much if not most education was within the framework of the seminary and the idea of the modern college was emerging. Harvard - 1636. Yale - 1701  Cambridge and Oxford and the University of Paris had lineages as old as the mid 12th century, but perhaps it's best to view those in the context of being THE school, not in a world of readily available schools. By the foundation of the United States, Calculus and Trigonometry exist in the world and some people at the University - some - study it. 

Literally at the same time as the birth of Trigonometry and the spread of calculus is the **industrial revolution**. They are the same thing. They are part and parcel of one another. Things that mark the industrial revolution were only possible through the birth of these new mathematics, such as standardization of bolts and screws, the ability to manufacture matching parts, etc. Eli Whitney built his factory for interchangeable gun parts in 1798. 

So the upper class, and some middle and lower class adults who develop some skills and get into colleges (the seminary was a way for the poor to become educated), are studying Calculus not at the post-grad level, but now at the graduate level, and now the undergraduate level. Calculus *requires* you to be deeply facile in the other three disciplines, algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. As younger and younger students are needing that, the study of these things gets pushed into teen schooling, first at boarding schools for the middle and upper class, and then of course we have the invention of the modern public school by Horace Mann in the mid 19th century, and by the late 19th century, public schools **begin** to outnumber private schools. Dewey, at the turn of the 20th century, began convincing Americans that education should be free, universal, and focused on character and civic virtue, not simply trade school or erudition. 

In the 20th century, mathematics at the high school level was frequently, if not almost universally, taught as Algebra, Trig and Geometry, and calculus for those who could achieve it. As soon as calculus entered the public high school system, it re-oriented the purpose of the other classes, just as the invention of calculus had conjoined algebra and geometry two hundred years early. This can be viewed as the driver for mathematical reform in the 70s and 80s (""New Math"") and our current trend towards integrated mathematics and communication in mathematics. 


Obviously, I've skipped a million things, but here's the **tl:dr - of course you'll never USE calculus in the middle school or even high school level, but if teachers didn't have to take calculus, they would have zero idea of what the pieces of the puzzle fit together to make.**"
Middleschoolteachers,"Music is the path to go if you want to have fun all the time, but you have to be willing to work a few jobs you aren’t crazy about until you can build up enough experience to land your ideal job.

I taught K-5 music for the first four years of my career, and I thought about quitting every day. Some days were so bad I’d come home and couldn’t even talk about it with my spouse, I’d just have to eat dinner and go to bed early. 

I teach middle school orchestra now and it makes me so happy to go into work and play so much fun music with the sweetest kids in the building. I have lovely coworkers, a beautiful teaching space, a fabulous budget, and supportive administration, but it didn’t start that way.

Edit to add: In many scenarios, there is extracurricular money to be made, as well. After school ensembles, drama/musicals, marching band, and so on. I get a stipend for concerts, as well as a stipend for running an after school advanced group. OH, and private lessons, gigging for musicals, working at music summer camps/schools, etc...."
Middleschoolteachers,"This is a hard question to answer. 50% of new teachers leave in the first 5 years of their career. There isn't just one issue. Some schools I have worked in have high turnover rates because teachers can't handle the students at the school. Some schools are like prisons. I once was an AP at a school where I had over two dozen middle schoolers with probation officers. Assault, rape, arson, theft, and gang affiliation were not uncommon. I had the police there once a week at least. 

Some leave because teaching is hard. it take a lot of time, dedication, and patience to teach. A lot of people can't handle their one kid during this pandemic. Imagine when I taught 6 classes a day and each had 40 kids. I had no room to walk around in my classroom. 

Stress is a big factor for some. Deadlines, state exams, evaluations, and parent conferences are just the tip of the iceberg. I served in Iraq when we invaded and I found some days being a teacher/admin more stressful. 

it is hard for me to say that there is one thing that can lesson the load. Sometimes the teachers just need donut, a cup of coffee, a reem of paper, and a thank you."
Middleschoolteachers,"As long as she has access to media and classmates with more mainstream views, I wouldn't be too worried about her. Anecdotally, I grew up with very racist parents, but it didn't even make a dent. By the time I hit middle school age, I knew to take everything they said with a grain of salt, and I knew they were from an older generation with outdated views. I didn't really figure out all the details about racial issues until I was older, but the seeds were planted, and it's hard to avoid exposure to modern thought unless you are completely isolated.

I would worry a bit if she happens to be LGBT, though."
Middleschoolteachers,Wow! There is such a thing as failure in your middle school?! Our parents always opt to promote their students who don’t do anything even if retention is recommended.
Middleschoolteachers,"Hearing curse words at recess.

Kids think we don’t hear them talking to their friends. We do.

For reference, this is middle school."
Middleschoolteachers,"What I did, was I took a practice test and on every single question I didnt absolutely know the answer to, I screenshotted and put in a document. Then going through each question, I would write down the part I should study. 

My top one was definetly functions. It takes a lot of self discipline but make a timeline/chart and force yourself to study.

Edit: Just adding that I feel you. I understand that this test is a beast and I feel no other content test is as unruly as this one (I've taken most the social studies ones) I saw that you teach middle school math. I hear you and I appreciate you for what you do. Please dont give up. 
A lot of people say there is a shortage of qualified math teachers. Well there is a shortage of math teachers in general. We all need to support each other as a collective group and every individual is worth and deserves to do what they want to do, even if they cant find a derivative."
Middleschoolteachers,"If you don’t end up getting a job and schools are open, try to sub in as many different districts as possible. I subbed for 2.5 year before I got my first full time job. I did long-term positions in middle school science, high school biology, 9th grade English, middle school Spanish and a few middle school social studies. I was a preferred sub at a lot of districts around me. I don’t live in that area anymore (moved out of state for my husband’s job) but I still keep in touch with the principals and am hoping that if/when we move back I’ll be able to use those connections. 

I had more job rejections than I can count and it definitely sucks, but you just need to keep your head up and apply for everything you can."
Middleschoolteachers,"Classroom management in high school was pretty laid back in my classroom. Need a tissue? To go to the restroom? Get up, don’t cause a distraction, and come back quietly. No practicing needed. Do what you need to do and don’t waste anyone’s time. Spoiler alert: this did NOT work in my middle school classroom. 

After moving from high school to 7th grade, my classroom management was absolute shit the first 9+ weeks. I was NOT prepared to have explicit directions for everything. Middle schoolers need lots of reinforcement, and expectations need to be taught, modeled, and revisited routinely. They want you to think they’re independent, but they most certainly are not. I was ready to quit after the first semester, to be honest. 

I’m now entering my 4th year in middle school (2 years in 7th, 1 in 6th, and upcoming in 7th), and I love it. They’re goofy. They have hilarious stories to tell. Most are willing to engage and participate. There’s still some level of hand holding in the beginning as they learn the rules, but as long as you stick firmly to your rules and expectations—and consequences—it gets a lot easier. If you can think of absolutely anything in the classroom where you can establish expectations and routines, do it."
Middleschoolteachers,"I can think of some ways in which knowledge of high school level calculus (so-called horizon content knowledge) can help inform instruction in earlier courses. For example, I see a unit on piecewise functions in Algebra 1 as an opportunity to get students thinking (informally) about limits and continuity, and this exploration can be a great way to have them put into practice their understanding of piecewise functions. And I think there are lots of other examples of where knowledge of calculus and real analysis can deepen instruction, not just in algebra but in geometry as well. 

But I agree that calculus is kinda overrated. I'd rather that middle school teachers be expected to know number theory and be able to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic than be expected to know calculus and be able to do integration by parts. It'd be nice if we could have both."
Middleschoolteachers,"Stress caused by shitty admin is insane. I turned in my notice (with about 14 others at that middle school that year) after only six months of a new admin’s micromanaging, critiquing, and constant questioning of methods. Before him, it wasn’t the easiest school to be at but it wasn’t the absolute hell my last year there was.

My new principal is amazing. She is only a couple of years out from teaching a full course load, so she remembers what it is like to be in the classroom (the other guy was at the alternative placement school where he had a self-contained class of five students—I definitely don’t think that was easy, especially since a couple of mine ended up there, but it is a different skill set than a classroom jammed full of 32 students). I’m not harassed about what I’m doing for no reason; I only get visits if it’s observation time or I specifically told someone I planned something cool for class that day and invited them to join us.

I feel like a lot of admin have bought into that stereotype of the lazy teacher who shows movies every day (and I just had to laugh because I do use a lot of media, but it can take a week to watch a whole documentary because of the discussions, the starts and stops, and the questions they ask) and doesn’t teach. I feel like the shutdown has shown that we’re not just showing up and expecting a paycheck for no work. I worked more (in less hours) than my accountant husband did working at home—the luxurious bathroom and coffee breaks he was used to taking! My goodness!"
Middleschoolteachers,I will be in a suburb of a small city in a generally decent looking district. It is a very large middle school and I would be moving into a science elective position with potential to develop the line further if all goes well. Emphasis on the last part!
Middleschoolteachers,"You need to have a bachelor's degree (master's in some states) and a teaching credential (sometimes rolled into the undergraduate program, though...if you're teaching middle school or above, I'd recommend majoring in your content matter and earning the credential afterwards)."
Middleschoolteachers,"I was going to go into middle school teaching. But then my state suddenly cancelled their ARL (Alternate Routes to Licensure) program.

I kept substitute teaching and looking for other education-related jobs.

Eventually, COVID-19 hit, and that was the end of my attempt at an education-related career.

I now ended up a job selling insurance and helping senior citizens with medicare.

I am glad I chased the dream of teaching before giving up. But I am kind of relieved to have failed at attaining it.

Selling insurance is going to be really hard for the first year or two.

But after 4-5 years I will be making triple what a teacher would, and after 6-7 years I will be able to maintain that income in about 35 hours a week.

All the teachers at the schools I worked for made me feel like I was wanted in that world, and I am sad to leave the students behind. But I am glad this is what happened to me.

Something needs to happen to improve the culture. And teachers need to be paid what they are worth."
Middleschoolteachers,"I've always taught middle school, but I worked mostly with 8th grade. This past year was my first in 6th. What I struggled with most is...

1. They contribute very little. Their stories are rarely connected to the content, and while they may have opinions to share, those are usually just regurgitated soundbites from their parents.

2. They are so needy. They are loving and want attention all. The. Time. Peer attention isn't enough for them. They follow you around the room if you don't set up boundaries.

3. They rarely answer/check their email--Their parents do it. This has been SO frustrating during online learning.

The content is fun, and they love it. Look for any conspiracies you can find to ""hook"" them, but make sure to have discussions often about why those conspiracies aren't plausible... They will believe them if you aren't careful!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Yeah I have 60 kids and they're in middle school. I also know that if I don't bug them now, I get all the assignments 3 days before grades are due."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have really bad anxiety, especially social anxiety. I’ve actually found that not only does it make me a better teacher, but teaching has helped me be less anxious. I work at a middle school I’m not so nice area with a ton of at risk kids. Being able to talk to them about things that they are feeling and what they can do to help themselves has been great for them. At the same time with that demographic I’ve found that if I show I am anything less then 100% while teaching then they will basically eat me alive, which has actually been great because no matter how I feel I have to at least act like I’m not panicking, which in turn has lead to me actually being more confident and comfortable around people."
Middleschoolteachers,"There is value on it, sure, but did you need to know how to integrate by parts accurately to know that algebra one is leading to integration? 

Conceptual knowledge is more than enough in most use cases. When I taught AP Calculus, knowing HOW to solve a partial differential equation was no more useful than knowing that it was coming. 

Also: I know a lot of teachers who can and do do a great job of teaching middle school math or algebra 1 but couldn’t even define a derivative, let alone take one."
Middleschoolteachers,"Mine is starting middle school, so yes it is possible depending on custody arrangements"
Middleschoolteachers,"I was a middle school teacher, and it definitely depended on the students' context and our relationship. If I know the student was facing a lot of instability and lack of support, I would give them my phone number. However, it was definitely a scary experience when I had a student call me over the weekend due to a mental health crisis."
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, the tape diagrams! Those are a big issue! I have no problem with them in and of themselves, but in the middle school sections, Eureka transitions from tape diagrams to more algebraic representations. The issue is, since our kids don't use Eureka in elementary school, they aren't used to tape diagrams. So the 6th grade spends time teaching them those skills just for them to turn around and be told to stop using it by the time 7th grade comes around. We end up playing a lot of catch up teaching them skills that Eureka thinks they should already know.

Also, what you said makes a lot of sense when I think about it in the context of my situation with the advanced classes. When the top ~40% of kids are pulled out of our grade level classes to go into advanced algebra or geometry courses, then that 20-30% of students you mention ends up being 50% or more of the population we're using Eureka with. So in our grade level classes, we see huge amounts of kids unable to make the connections Eureka expects of them. The top kids come away with good conceptual understanding, though often poor procedural fluency. But there are so few ""top"" kids in these classes in the first place."
Middleschoolteachers,"This! You can’t know until you experience it. 

I went into teaching only wanting older students/ HS, until my Middle School student teaching placement. I loved it, and was consistently blown away by them. I’ve been teaching middle school ever since, and even told my principal this actualization in my interview."
Middleschoolteachers,I could totally see this being the new fashion competition in middle school to see who can get the coolest mask. And then I can imagine Mr. Cool 8th grader refusing to take it off when requested... the possibilities are endless in middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,"I’m kind of surprised to see so many people concerned about you giving out your phone number. Granted, I wouldn’t give any of my middle schoolers my phone number, but I had four different teachers’ cell phone numbers in high school! They were all mentors, and remained professional. I guess it just depends on the culture of your school. 

I’m glad you were able to be there for that student and she knew that she could trust you to get her out of a sticky situation."
Middleschoolteachers,"Fair enough! I chose early elementary, so I only have anecdotal experience with middle school, and often forget about phones. I'd rather students just *tell* me there's a booger"
Middleschoolteachers,"I think because this is our first go with home learning, it was a ""no news is good news"" situation. Our check-in calls on Google Meet were only 15 minutes, and anyone in the grade could hop on (we're a small school), so it was meant to be like a conversation rather than a tutorial. For the ones that came, they seemed fine. They seemed less energetic because they stayed up late and slept in, lol. Also, so many of them are used to talking to their peers using social media and video chatting, anyone who had a phone and wanted to reach out to their friends probably did so on their own.

I don't take their lack of participation personally  (in middle school, it's not cool to talk to the teacher more than you have to), but I want to build in some kind of check in to normalize talking to me online so that if they ever DID have an issue, they would communicate with me more."
Middleschoolteachers,"I know! I had the opposite satisfaction, I was like, now that your kid will be in middle school and not in your building, let’s see how long before he is actually getting office referrals and suspended."
Middleschoolteachers,"First of all, i am so sorry to hear of your nightmare situation, you are stronger than I al to receive such discrimination and not lose your marbles. That shows you have a good head on your shoulders, which is encouraging considering what you’re up against. I think you should go for student teaching, but in a WAY different district. Union would be ideal, but I know they’ve been gutted in that hellhole you call home. I am a middle school first year, hybrid classes. I’ve already learned early on that things vary SO MUCH from district to district and even school to school. I was almost failed in student teaching for unprofessional dress and behavior (wearing literal slacks and a button down, but with casual shoes and occasionally wrinkled shirts because I had -$27 to my name), I had a disciplinary discussion for talking about football (yes, American football) with a student because it was not age appropriate??) and another because my tattoo would occasionally show just under my long sleeves. Anyway I went to this district for my first job that was the complete opposite of that. I have gotten cards from admin telling me how happy they are that I’m here, was given a paid position working on an extracurricular, have presented how to use our tech at an all-staff meeting, and I have had students and parents alike rave about how much they love my class. I feel happy and excited to come into work every day, when at one time I felt like a parish and thought about leaving the profession every day. My favorite teacher at this school chills at his desk all day. We don’t have to juggle to teach good content... I encourage you to keep your head up and give it a shot (also, maybe consider Jr High it HS), in general those settings make you move around a lot less."
Middleschoolteachers,"This is so helpful! I’m thinking about teaching middle school as well, I hope you are having a good first year
Did you have a lot of experience before you did student teaching, or was that where you learned the most?"
Middleschoolteachers,"What grade do you teach? I might get more flexibility with it being that I teach middle school. Ideally though, I work on the belief that a D is just a coward's F. We shouldn't be satisfied with anything below a 70 really."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm new but I love teaching. I like the admin, I like my colleagues. I'm having a lot of fun and am excited about my future. 

I think the key takeaways from this sub are:

\- Don't work at private or charter expecting any kind of worker protection

\- Don't teach in a state that has no/weak unions

I am very happy with my union and their relationship with the superintendent and admin. My work environment is emotionally healthy. Me and my colleagues do not work beyond contracted hours (mayyyybe an extra 30 mins here and there if we need to meet a deadline or need to do something out of the ordinary prep-wise?) 

I am lower elementary. I hear a lot of misery from middle school and high school on here. My husband is a high school EBD teacher and is very happy  with his job and being in this field. He is going on year 11. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Are things perfect? No. I could bitch about a number of things, but that's mostly because I care about my kids and my job and need to vent to process things. 

To be a teacher I think you need to make sure you don't stay in toxic schools and avoid states that have unfriendly labor laws which seek to exploit your labor and devalue your expertise."
Middleschoolteachers,"This right here. If we were to spend the same amount of money on every extra curricular opportunity for students and they still chose sports good for them, that’s their choice. But that’s definitely not the case as we all know. We glorify sports in so many ways in and out of school. Nothing wrong with sports themselves but the emphasis and importance of sports has eclipse pretty much every other facet of school. Ignoring the actual legal obligations, if sports is the only reason you do school, how did you make it to middle school/high school? It’s the images you see in media that perpetuate sports being the fantasy life that you can achieve through hard work, when in reality it’s an extremely small portion of even the most talented players that get called for that."
Middleschoolteachers,"Had my first full time position for half a year last year was getting 55k in the district I used to be in. Unfortunately they were looking for more experience long-term, offered me a middle school position for like 15k less so I said no. Now I'm an underpaid overworked sub, Texas let's get a move on pitter patter reps."
Middleschoolteachers,"I cuss all of the time outside of my classroom but have an incredible filter in front of the kids. I dunno why, I don’t even think about it, it just works! Until last week...

We’re fully virtual and I was meeting with my 11th and 12th grade musical theater class. The topic of saving playbills from various shows they’ve seen had come up and without even realizing it I said, “When I was 13 I thought it would be cool to rip all the covers off of my playbills and fucking tape them to my door.” 

I immediately clapped my hand over my mouth and the kids were in absolute hysterics because they know how “straight edge” I am. One of them said, “Ms. Kaori, the fact that after everything we’ve gone through, THAT is what you swore about shows how much you really care about theater.” 🤣

Seriously, though, fuck middle school me for thinking that was cool and rip my collection of playbills..."
Middleschoolteachers,Seventeen years teaching middle school...and I can absolutely 💯 agree with this.  I've taught all three grades.  One year I moved from 6th to 7th with the exact same kids..it was like watching angels fall from grace.  I still loved those kids though.
Middleschoolteachers,"40 pages lesson plans - not normal. This might a be problem with the format they want you to use.



The visits?  - Normal

Sub plans - Normal. In fact a bit late tbh..I got asked for mine before halloween and I teach middle school which is easier to find coverage for."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have had parents tell me that their kids was scared of me. I have had students tell me that they were afraid to get me as a teacher. I expect a certain level of effort from my students and I hold them accountable. Many middle school students don’t like that.

I have a sign on my board that says, “If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss.”"
Middleschoolteachers,"My wife was talking to a 5th grade student, saying she does such a good job helping other kids she might make a great teacher. 

The student replied: “my mom gets paid to stay home and watch tv. I’d rather do that.”

My wife tried and failed to change the girl’s mind before she left for middle school. Sigh..."
Middleschoolteachers,I’m one of the youngest if not the youngest teacher at my middle school. Everyone calls each other by their first names even our principal. I think it’s nice but I do feel weird calling other teachers/admin by their first names so I usually use last names. It’s just do it out of respect though since everyone else is at least a couple years older than me.
Middleschoolteachers,Interesting. I always take late work and our grades don’t matter. Students are very aware that straight Fs still goes to high school. I teach in an urban middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,Literally same situation here. NJ middle school teacher here who can't find a vaccine apt to save her life (literally?) and I go back in person in one week
Middleschoolteachers,"My school calls everyone by their last names (no prefix) when talking about colleagues. I used to hate it, but I teach middle school in a K-8, and many of the elementary school teachers go by “Ms./Mr. First Name,” which I hate a lot more. Calling ourselves and each other by our last names helps remind the middle schoolers that we want to be addressed that way."
Middleschoolteachers,"I am a middle school art teacher and this year has been hellish in some ways, great in others. I killed myself at the start of the year to make almost 200 art kits for kids to pick up and take home. I equipped my classroom (I am fortunate to teach in a very well-supported program) with computer and camera tech to allow me to broadcast a live feed of step-by-step creation process on Zoom. 

About six weeks ago our board and our feckless turd of a superintendent decided we were all going to go back in hybrid mode, with no stable cohorts, despite assuring everyone back in January that electives and PE, which have mixed cohorts, would stay in distance learning for the rest of the year. So I had to completely reconfigure my classroom to allow for kids being back in the room, and now a good $2K worth of supplies are going to go to waste because we can't do the work both at school and at home. 

I haven't even begun to mention the number of kids I know who have checked out completely - they are all doing other things online, and they turn in work only after I chase after them repeatedly and/or email their parents, and the work they do turn in reflects maybe 15 minutes of half-assed work on a project that should have taken several hours of dedicated work.

That said, there are also a number of kids who have thrived, and done great work. But I am so over trying to squeeze anything meaningful out of the delinquent group. It's exhausting, frustrating, and a complete waste of time."
Middleschoolteachers,"In honor of middle school boys everywhere, I just need to share that I was the 69th like on this post."
Middleschoolteachers,I never even read my contract. They literally just gave me a bunch of papers to sign. I don’t even know how many personal/sick days I have. I do know that I donated to the sick bank. Definitely will read my next contract thoroughly. I’ll talk with some teachers and see if they know about that. Another first year teacher is trying to move to middle school so she can coach.
Middleschoolteachers,"I kept my lessons bare bones and limited to two different pieces of software for a few reasons: 

1. Kids are not very tech savvy. You can run workshops on how to use things, but you will still get dozens of emails or comments asking for help on how to do something or how to use a certain tool, even if it was your third time showing them that week. 

2. The KISS principle applies well in distance learning. My lessons every day are predictable, simple, asking for the bare minimum. I’m practically spoon feeding standards content. The expectation is set early on, and you can always refer to the fact that your lessons are not complicated and predictable. 

3. Your weekly planning becomes less stressful. The framework you set for simplicity becomes a “plug and play” scenario. 

I teach middle school, though. This probably doesn’t apply to elementary Ed teachers. Bless all of you right now."
Middleschoolteachers,"I actually though about that a little too. Being in middle school I notice that there are more men in general, which maybe influences the last names? I don't really notice in some teachers being called by their last names, while others aren't though."
Middleschoolteachers,Listen I’m a public middle school teacher and I’m fully vaccinated. I want to be back in school doing my job. There are other reasons besides childcare that kids should be back in school. The students I have in person can’t ignore me anymore and are finally completing some work. I’m ready and willing to do the job I signed up to do.
Middleschoolteachers,"Same boat - we return to block schedule hybrid after spring break. I’ll see each middle school art class 15 times before summer break. In that time we have state testing, NWEA, finals, and I think a few assemblies.

So. I might get to teach one or two art projects in person. Why bother?"
Middleschoolteachers,"Yet, like usual, decisions are made for the few or the what ifs. High school and many middle school aged kids dont need a parent at home. Childcare should be THE reason to open schools. If we have a childcare problem,  THAT needs to be fixed."
Middleschoolteachers,"Do you have any other career interests that deal with math? Accounting? Engineering? Or do you see yourself teaching in another subject area or grade level? Are you interested in the medical field at all? Nursing? What about anything technology/computer related?

I'm just throwing out some ideas. I know how limiting it can feel to be trained as an educator and not really seeing life beyond the classroom. A friend of mine taught math for several years and decided he needed a career change. He took an electrical engineering course at the local community college and really enjoyed it, then applied and was accepted to an engineering master's program at a university with a great engineering program. He's now making *way* more money and is much happier. 

I'm a high school English teacher and have been for 19 years. I was on the verge of resigning back in November because I'm just so burnt out. I really don't have many other options and I want to stay in the system to get my retirement and where I live there just isn't much else I could do and still earn the same salary and benefits. So, I'm moving to middle school next year! It's still ELA, but it's going to be enough of a change that I'm actually excited about it."
Middleschoolteachers,"We just returned to hybrid, middle school ELA also. I don’t have very many kids at this point as most elected to stay virtual, so I’m not sure what kind of class sizes you’ll be dealing with but either way hopefully you are fully vaccinated. Otherwise, try to understand that you and your students will learn as you go. You will make mistakes and adjust and so will they. Just try to be a calm, supportive presence for your students during an extremely difficult and stressful time. You don’t have to be perfect for them, but you can be caring even when they’re not and they have attitudes that everything sucks. But you are that positive light that keeps encouraging and offering chances and not getting down, a model, an example of how to be, how to face adversity, how to treat yourself and others. So forgive yourself for the technicalities and focus on the caring and support and encouragement because it takes so much energy to do it well, especially when you’re in the face of all the middle school gloom. You’ll get through the stupid testing. You’ll give them mints, help them take stretch breaks, encourage them while poking fun at the testing, trying to keep it light and take the pressure off, and remind them how amazing they are just for finishing a section without falling asleep. Try to remember that with all the bullshit there is around this job, with data and testing and objectives and rigor and new protocols and whatever else, this is a job about caring for kids and making sure they have someone supporting them, encouraging them, and providing them with an opportunity to learn. So I try to just focus on caring for my students and everything else will fall into place or figure itself out. Good luck!"
Middleschoolteachers,I’ve only been in 2nd and 3rd and I can say I love 3rd. It’s a weird transition year but I love the personalities that emerge. I definitely could never move up to 5th or even middle school. You should go for it if you are considering it!
Middleschoolteachers,😂 my middle school students have sometimes mistaken me for a student
Middleschoolteachers,"I mean, I don't think that's the most culturally responsive and engaging curriculum,  but I think Shakespeare and excerpts from The Odyssey can be taught in middle school (I only taught 7th and 8th, but I did teach at a Title 1, and I taught Midsummer and used an excerpt from The Iliad, though I embedded it with high interest fiction like The Outsiders, House on Mango Street, Monster, etc and tried as best I could to include diverse authors). Poe, they can definitely read.  No one should be mandated to read Chaucer's work unless it's modernized though."
Middleschoolteachers,"And I almost forgot, be weary of stepping down mentally &amp; emotionally to their level. For example, middle school teachers often imitate the maturity of their students. Remember that you are always the adult and authority in the room, and have the confidence to not back down when it really counts. You'll do great!"
Middleschoolteachers,Our district just adopted StudySync for middle school ELA. Seems very reasonable in terms of rigor to me.
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I told my kids today, “the last students I sent on spring break, I never saw them again.” I was student teaching in a middle school a year ago. Our last day, March 13, was the day we sent them off for spring break. My internship was canceled thanks to COVID, and I never saw those students again.

One of my students today remarked that I told the class I loved them - I show my love in different ways, but I usually don’t say “I love you all.” But I did today. 

How spring break ended last year is why I told today’s students I love them and I’ll miss them - because I didn’t cherish that moment a year ago, not thinking I would need to. 

I’d give anything to see all those squirming 6th grade faces again."
Middleschoolteachers,"Honestly it’s not just middle school. I’m supposed to teach Number the Stars to my 4th grades who should be at an end of year INSTRUCTIONAL S. This book is a U and most of them are reading at an average independent O... there’s some consonants between these vowels.

Also I read the odyssey in 9th grade in high school and Chaucer in ap English senior year. Shakespeare every year. I would look elsewhere."
Middleschoolteachers,"I can relate, at my middle school it has always been so that students start language in the 8th grade, meaning we’ve only ever had one of each teacher (when really we should have at least another PT Spanish teacher). 

Well this year they decided to start language in the 7th grade, but they didn’t see the need to hire more staff to cover the literal extra 150+ students per language. So now I teach 350 students by myself by meeting with them every other day instead of every day. It has been the worst year of my career, and if it weren’t for the fact that one of the high school teachers is resining, giving me the chance to move up there, I would be looking for other employment this summer.

I’m usually pretty resigned to the fact that languages are not a priority class, but the way we have been treated this year is just beyond ridiculous."
Middleschoolteachers,"The ones who are stay at home moms are the worst lmao one of my students mothers told me that during the day is her “me time” when I called to tell her, her kid doesn’t do anything and is late everyday. Lmao don’t have kids then. I rolled my eyes and gave up, thankfully her kid is coming back to hybrid but he’s a year behind and going to fall really hard when he goes to middle school after summer."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have some PTSD myself related to an assault a few weeks before I started my job, so I think when sometimes hearing my students have gone through something similar but as a kid (I teach middle school), I just hits a little different. 

I’ve been trying recently to adjust my mindset to always ask myself what is in my control and what isn’t so I don’t burn myself out. I think this most recent news and how I reacted proves that I still have a lot of work to do!"
Middleschoolteachers,"In person since Sept. A few dozen kids in my middle school have gotten it, but about 90% of them were already quarantined at home due to exposure at the time (aka we know where they got it and it wasn't school). Fewer than a dozen kids came to school sick, sending classmates into quarantine. And the only spread within the school was limited to 2 admins who had an unmasked meeting and spread it to each other and a class that had an unmasked party one weekend with a kid who turned out to be positive and spread it to most of the class. All kids have had minor cases"
Middleschoolteachers,I know - it has to do with trying to teach a bunch of middle school kids on the first day of school in person for the entire year with staff who feels like shit.
Middleschoolteachers,"No, middle school. 😂"
Middleschoolteachers,"Thats awesome! I teach music, but Im a giant nerd for history myself. Depending on your level of expertise in podcasting as well as technology availability, you can have students create podcast project about whatever unit youre on. Im doing one right now on the music side of things and the middle school students I have enjoy it since they can work together and it gives them an opportunity to put together a product."
Middleschoolteachers,"Well, I’ve talked about this on this subreddit and many agreed that it can often be as simple as a different school that matters. Have you been at many schools? Many districts? Taught in different towns or states? 

I’m not saying you’re wrong but the teachers I know and my experience as a sub in a couple schools, I never heard or observed anyone say things like you are. I’m not saying it can’t or didn’t happen but everyone friggin loved their jobs at the middle school where I primarily worked.

So, I’m hopeful I’m lucky in regard to the town I’m in but yeah, I’m wary of what you say and will have to brace myself for it."
Middleschoolteachers,"My context is a middle school ELA teacher.

1. I have formatted my instruction to be based on teaching skills, instead of content. For example, we spend one 'unit' on 'making text connections - to person, text and world'. During this unit, we will read, write and view texts/images.
2. Because we are teaching the skill, I have basically abandoned worksheets. I have some stuff I will use as graphic organizers, but that's the extent because...
3. Formative work is just class discussions (around the graphic organizer) and student conferences. I don't actually take the organizer in for a grade. This way, I can grade them, largely, live.
4. Summative work is based on their own self-assessment of their learning. They build unit long 'portfolios' that show their growth in the skills. These portfolios are student-selected, and they provide me with an explanation as to why it is their best work. These are the only things I grade.
5. I have around 7 units, and each takes around a month. We then spend the last 2-3 months on small group book clubs, where they have a package they progress through over the months that acts as a compilation of their skills. I will grade this as well, but are set up to provide opportunities for self-assessment.

I also have four prep-time blocks in the week, and divide them as:

* 2 of them are for planning
* 1 is for grading on-time submissions
* 1 is for grading lates (should I lose a prep due to a meeting, this is the one that goes)

I arrive usually 15 minutes before contract time (largely for social reasons because I have an amazing teaching team) and stay up to 30 minutes after contract time (for largely the same social reasons). Nothing, and this has always been my rule, comes home with me, and I NEVER open up my work email or Google Classroom once I have left the school building."
Middleschoolteachers,"As a paraprofessional, the lead teacher sets the tone and does most of the discipline. Your dad just needs to watch what the teacher does and ask questions and work within that system. 

Most middle schools also have their own school wide discipline- like Make Your Day or another points system. Tell him not to worry, just go in with an open mind and pay attention!"
Middleschoolteachers,"I used to LMTS sub at a middle school a couple years ago, and was also the go-to for the school's chromebook issues.  So many spilled sodas onto keyboards.  There was even one girl who's chromebook got thrown into a bathtub by her kid brother (because admins also had the bright idea of letting the Chromebooks go home with the kids)."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school emotional support, almost died in a house fire this year and had a complete mental break down when I went back after the fire. I was pulled out again and am now on massive amounts of depression/anxiety meds. I hate being on prescription meds, but I wouldn’t be okay to work without them.  I’m high as a kite most days on these meds, but I’m not crying all day long."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm a sub teacher but I'm teaching a middle school computer class for a whole year.  I'm focusing on teaching the kids the basics of typing, word processing, spreadsheets, and powerpoint (albeit the Google drive versions).  And omg they don't understand how to use them!  But that's what they're in school for."
Middleschoolteachers,"Definitely varies by state. In NY, students are required to start earning World Language credits in middle school, but from what WL is optional or nonexistent in some other states’ middle schools."
Middleschoolteachers,"So dumb.

I teach science and I'm so tired of the push for science, math and literacy. Hell, they are mostly pushing math and literacy and actually slowly doing away with science as an important subject at the lower levels.

&amp;#x200B;

FFS, it's all important. Including foreign language.

It's an absolute joke that there are so many countries where they learn English...just fine...as well as their native language. But we treat learning a foreign language like it's useless.

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty of times I wish I could have learned another language while growing up and not just in middle and high school. And even then I had French in middle school and then Spanish in high school because we didn't have a French teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of ""core courses"" versus ""electives"" is such horse shit. Is their some form of learning happening? Good!"
Middleschoolteachers,that's good. i'm glad to hear other places are doing better. I had a similar experience-- started with languages in middle school and am still continuing to this day.
Middleschoolteachers,"I switched careers so I'm in my 30s. I didn't really have any tech classes in school though. In middle school we had a typing class for a couple months. When I graduated from high school I didn't even have my first smart phone yet. So I def wasn't in that group.

Since I'm still learning things like hyperlinking I wouldn't assume that any aged student knows how to do anything. A lot of your examples are really surprising, but if a student has never had to do these things before, why should we assume that they know how to do it?"
Middleschoolteachers,"Its a pervasive  attitude everywhere and at all age groups.  I teach middle school Agriscience, and I'm an FFA Advisor and my curriculum is mostly stuff the students will use one day in the real world with maybe 30% Ag/Farm specific content  They simply don't want to bother with it...  ""Mr. Infidel, hey I started selling my chickens' eggs at home for $1.50 a dozen and I sell out every day but I'm not making money. This is stupid!""    Never mind that I've shown them repeatedly, from start to finish, how to factor in initial costs, feed costs, bedding, and any other expenditures and calculate break even cost.   That's just one example..."
Middleschoolteachers,"I don't want anything else from thos conversation.  You proved my point multiple times to I've one. You're just as bad as the ones I speak of. Too self centered to see your own flaws. I'm sure your just a wonderful person to he around judging by the way you talk. You start off this thread by asking do other teachers think your a hypocritical asshole to which all these basic teachers answer no. Yet when you get an answer from a student, you don't want to even entertain the idea, maybe you're part of the problem.  I understand perfectly that sometimes you need to do what your told, but so do you. I also understand that not every work project is some bullshit being forced on me that has absolutely no relevance to the real world.  Past 9th grade, what do you need? Other than your profession, when do you use anything you learned past middle school.  Your  conversational English doesn't surpass a thirteen year old so you cant say you use that. You seem pretty ose minded, again, the mindset of a Child.  Incredibly dismissive of other who have an opinion different than your own as seen through this thread. Just another typical teacher wasting students time."
Middleschoolteachers,"It's odd-- where I'm teaching now, it seems to be a rarity. The other districts I've worked in-- and where I went to middle school myself-- we always had several offers. I took Latin in middle school, but could've taken Spanish, French, or Chinese.

In my current district, when I leave, they are losing their entire world language department. I was it-- I was all they had. Now they have nothing. And no world language teacher in his or her right mind is going to walk into this job with this schedule they've made."
Middleschoolteachers,Wait your school systems have foreign language in middle school!?!?  Cool all the ones I have been in don’t...
Middleschoolteachers,"That's a great idea, thanks for the suggestion! I actually do teach middle school, so I think this would work."
Middleschoolteachers,"I had this problem last year while watching middle school lunch. No, I'm not profiling you... You're standing on the table trying to invite a riot..."
Middleschoolteachers,"That’s so exciting! I’m taking a non conventional path to becoming a teacher, too! I am working toward becoming a middle school English language arts teacher. I love that age group."
Middleschoolteachers,"How many interviews have you had? I was a top student in college with about as much possible teaching experience as you could get (pk-12) and I finally got a job offer to teach middle school instrumental music on my 9th job interview. Don't give up, you will find the right place!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Agreed. 

Had a student not turning in much work, not showing up. I reached out to the parent (who I have a decent relationship with) and they flat out said ""it is what it is... he was hospitalized due to panic attacks, his father and I are getting a divorced, his  older brother has some significant behavioral issues, my kid's world (at age 13) is completely falling apart... this school year is just going to be a mulligan; if the teachers want to give him F's, they can do so. We are ok with that. Grades are the last thing on our mind; we are just trying to keep him afloat.""

If I were his middle school teacher in distance learning, I'm not sure what the purpose giving an F and adding fuel to this kid's fire of a year would do. I would communicate with our counselors and the high school so they're aware of what's going on for the kid's transition in the fall to 9th grade. But that's just me.

I didn't expect this forum to react differently. I do appreciate a few people who jumped on my comments eventually reach out to me privately to quasi-apologize. To quote the parent, it is what it is."
Middleschoolteachers,"Really good answers. I'm assuming you'd expand on them in person.l during an interview. 

Specifically, your best answers where the book question and the observation question. 

The memory from middle school, I would obviously tell a short story about each incident (kiss, fight) and perhaps try to weave them into a larger picture about how odd middle school can be. 

The chromebook question may be seen as your weakest response from admin perspective. It started off well, but I think admin and parents could be contacted earlier, especially for middle school. 

The parent question has a good summary, but obviously how you expand on that answer is key. 

Really good job."
Middleschoolteachers,That is why I specifically picked middle school! What are some things I should do to gain the students trust?
Middleschoolteachers,Good luck! Good thing we all wear mask nowadays because middle school students stink...
Middleschoolteachers,"My district is already doing that. We have an Indian couple as neighbors and they were brought in to teach in one of the worst, hardest to staff middle schools, and in my school we have a young lady from the Philippines as a lower elementary teacher. They get shit pay and treatment from the district, and have the stress of trying to keep their visas up to date, as well as dealing with kids who are often disrespectful and difficult to deal with. They also get brought in as a Step 1, even if they were teachers for years in their home country."
Middleschoolteachers,"In no particular order, some of my ones we have used...

1) please share a recent edu-book you read, why you chose that book, and what takeaways you had after reading it. 

2) scenario: a student is using their chromebook inappropriately. You give the student a warning. Five minutes later, the student is again using their chromebook inappropriately? What do you do now? 

2b) the next day, the student is using their chromebook incorrectly and ignores your request for them to rejoin the class lesson. What do you do? Please describe your steps and who you would involve in this process. 

3) scenario: a parent meets with you to discuss their ""gifted student"" who is earning a C+ in your class. You believe the student is quite bright but is not turning in their work; hence, their grade is lower. The parent shares that the student finds your class ""boring"" - how do you respond to the parent? What outcomes do you hope to have for the student post-meeting?

4) tech questions - blah blah blah 

5) what is your fondest memory from middle school? 

6) during your first observation, everything falls apart. The tech stops working. The kids slowly become restless. The classroom phone is ringing nonstop. Six students repeatedly ask to go to the bathroom. You feel like you're on the verge of tears because the assistant principal is taking notes and you know they see the chaos. The review of the observation is three days later. Pretend you are the assistant principal in that meeting and share what you would say as you begin the meeting to review the observation from three days ago. What three main pieces of advice would you give the teacher (you)? 

(Ok, I made up the last one on the spot, but I think I'd learn a lot about the candidate by how they demonstrated how to treat a teacher (themselves) who struggled (perhaps not due to their own fault) during their first observation. If they're kind, considerate, and understanding, I suspect that's how they'd treat their students.)"
Middleschoolteachers,"They can’t do math, either. Some kids thrive when math skills are thrown at them at a young age, but fall behind and just never catch up. I’m about to teach adding/subtracting rational expressions with my Algebra 2 class, and before I can do that I have to teach how to add/subtract numerical fractions because these kids had a calculator shoved at them in middle school and learned to rely on it instead of catching up on elementary skills that they struggled with."
Middleschoolteachers,"The math teacher at my middle school makes them do all of their working by hand, despite the fact that they use Khan Academy, and turn BOTH in - the assignment AND a photo of their hand-written workings. He said it cuts the Photomath cheaters right out of the equation."
Middleschoolteachers,"There was a fist fight once a month it felt like. It was rough, but not terrible. 

However, I remember being in classes that took down student teachers/ leave replacements and those nearing retirement. Once some kids smelled blood, that was it. 

My senior year I actually got to go back to my middle school and “student teach” through a senior option program. 

Kids were great. Respectful. I seriously wondered then what was up with my own classes."
Middleschoolteachers,"I'm a teacher now, but when I was in middle school, my dad was our schools only math teacher. In 8th grade, we had a cross country trip that you could only go on if you had a C average.

One kid in my class did not have that. My dad was pushed to change his grade, but refused. The principal pushed some other teachers to change his grade. This kids grade was eventually overridden by the principal (at least, this is my understanding of the story) and the kid went on the trip.

We fly to mother fucking Washington DC in late February. There is snow on the ground. It is bellow freezing. This kid forgot to bring shoes. He wor fuzzy slippers on the plane and had no other shoes with him. The kid had to walk a mile in the snow before we could stop somewhere to buy shoes.

Also my dad moved to another school after that year. I think he was already done with the school, but he stuck around until I graduated. I was bullied mercilessly, and admin made things a lot worse for me. At one point a kid snuck up and choked me unconscious, and I was unable to talk right for a couple days. He got a one day suspension, and the principal tried to suspend me as well. I think he stuck around to make sure I was safe and had a safe place to go at lunch/recess/after school.

That school sucked. Also I didn't find out about any of the grade changing or behind the scenes stuff until I was in college. My dad did a good job of separating his work stuff from me. There's still things he hasn't explained because of FERPA and privacy, and I'm cool with that."
Middleschoolteachers,"""Every student gets promoted to the next grade level regardless of their GPA.""

This is a problem. As a middle school teacher, I couldn't possibly disagree with you more."
Middleschoolteachers,"I have been moved 3 times in 3 years. I'm k-12 certified (art). 18/19 I was high school, 19/20 I was elementary and this year I'm middle school. I think admins attitude is a combo of them not realizing how hard it is and also ""you're lucky you didn't get laid off"" 🙄 it sucks though. My first move was because of budget cuts (pre-covid, my district just sucks at budgeting and got really in the hole) and the second move is because a few people quit due to covid and they restructured how the rest of our department was. I feel you, it's very stressful to move all the time!"
Middleschoolteachers,"We are a high performing middle school in the Bay Area, so my perspective is admittedly slanted. 

Of our students who are struggling, there seem to be two main groups: (1) really bright kids who always did well but distance learning and the pandemic knocked their life sideways and (2) some of our historically lower performing students who managed to get C's or better during pre-pandemic times **due to the support the adults on our campus provided for them in-person**. 

For the first group, the middle school F feels empty. For the second group, the F is almost tragic. 

But again, our school is a bit different, good or bad. 

Appreciate the discourse."
Middleschoolteachers,"Sorry, should have added I'm at a middle school. Grades mean little, if anything, here, as everyone promotes to the next grade level. We use a student's grades as one data point in how we can better serve them, possibly with counseling, home support, extra tutorial, tutoring, etc."
Middleschoolteachers,"During that “devious licks” Tiktok thing a few months ago, my husband’s middle school was allowing one student PER BUILDING to use the bathroom at a time. There was some kind of form you could check online to see if the bathroom was available. And they weren’t allowed to go during passing period."
Middleschoolteachers,"My middle school kids have the attention span of a tiktok. They can’t read a paragraph without falling asleep, their brains are so starved for quiet time."
Middleschoolteachers,I started in 7th grade and I hated it. Switching to high school was a game changer. I don't think I'd still teaching if I was in middle school.
Middleschoolteachers,"As long as it’s high school, classroom management isn’t too bad and I like being able to teach higher level content. You couldn’t pay me enough to teach middle school again; classroom management was like 90 percent of the job and I felt like all I did was break up fights and double as a school counselor. Also, forget about ever being able to sit at your desk to grade, plan, or answer emails while teaching middle school."
Middleschoolteachers,"Currently 8th grade science and high school Earth and Space Science. I've also done 7th grade science.

I'm not a fan of my middle school admin at all, but I like my content."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach English as a New Language (ESL/ENL/TESOL) to K/1 and 5. When my kids were little, there wasn't enough money in the world to get me to work with K. I just felt that I had enough ""little needy kid"" stuff going on at home to have it all day at school too. My admin decided to move me from 5/8 to K in what appeared to be a punitive measure. The joke was on them, though, I LOVED Kindergarten. I've done that for 10 years and have really fallen out of love with the littles. They are coming in with bigger and bigger academic, social defecits along with less and less school readiness skills. and I just find myself exhausted at the end of the day.

I have been looking to transition to high school because I can't stand the hormonal insanity of middle schoolers but in my district, there are only a couple of ""good"" buildings and I'm not going to make the choice lightly.

This is my first year back with 5th grade and I actually like it pretty well so if I can't get into another school, I will try to angle to work with just 4th/5th."
Middleschoolteachers,"To a degree I agree with you, but teachers should be teaching kids how to take care of their space.  I have it as part of my middle schoolers' art grade - maintaining the studio space.  I had a coworker at a past school who had the nastiest classroom because she just didn't care.  The custodians couldn't even properly clean it because it was just a room full of trash and horded junk, but how are they supposed to know what to toss?  There were papers everywhere, kids clothing all over the floors, every kind of school supply just strewn about with no organization, and lots of garbage mixed in to it all.  It stunk like death because kids would spill milk and food all the time and it would never get cleaned up...I'm sure lots of bodily fluids too as it was a younger grade.  I don't know how the custodians could come a mop or sanitize.  It was bad, and I feel like I would be embarrassed for parents to see that learning environment."
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach high school English. I couldn't imagine working with any other age group.

I like to joke that middle school is a pointless time and they should just lock students up for three years with their hormones to figure shit out, and then come to high school ready to learn."
Middleschoolteachers,"I am at the middle school level and elementary/middle, we only get the rapid tests. We'll see how that shakes out since our testing is on Mondays."
Middleschoolteachers,Teaching 7th graders who are on the emotional and maturity levels of 5th graders makes me grateful to be in middle school
Middleschoolteachers,Bless both of you. Teaching 9th graders this year who are on the emotional and educational maturity level of middle schoolers has really reinforced my love for high school
Middleschoolteachers,"Teaching is a very fulfilling job if you have good relationships with the people you deal with (students, admin, colleagues, parents - in order of importance). I love my job, even though I teach at a title 1 middle school that is one of the lowest performing in my state. 

There is a lot of bullshit, but that exists in any job. 

This sub may echo real issues and concerns within the field, but it is obviously a hub that collects a disproportionate amount of negative attention. This sub is incredibly toxic. There are still a lot of normal every day teachers on here but there is a sizeable chunk of teachers that frequent this sub that are just....toxic people. You probably have people that you knew in school that just had an overall terrible attitude, were low achievers, and spent more time sulking and complaining then just taking care of their shit. This sub is saturated with those types of people. Then you have the people on here who are just in the worst fucking possible situations and are obviously depressed, burned out, and empty husks of their former selves. They all come here to vent and get support. There is a lot....a LOT of negativity in this sub that doesn't give an accurate picture of our profession. 

Think about it this way: Most people who are very happy, satisfied, and fulfilled by their teaching job are not going to go out of their way to post on reddit about it. But those depressed people who just need to be seen/felt will flock where they can get it. 

My only consideration for you would be:  Make sure that if you still want to be a teacher that you are comfortable moving far away if you need to. The teaching profession varies wildly depending on where you teach. If you aren't comfortable moving far from home to find a good teaching gig then I hope you are lucky enough to live in a good area for teaching. 

As for the state of the profession, I am hoping that the pendulum will start to swing the other direction in the next decade. Things can only get so bad before they get better, and there are quite a few bad things in education that need to be fixed. I can't imagine it getting much worse than it is now."
Middleschoolteachers,It's also voluntary...so inaccurate rapid tests are available for those willing and able to go to a few middle school testing locations as our big snowstorm is melting off. Better than noting but feels like COVID safety theater.
Middleschoolteachers,Being 27 now and teaching middle school I know how ya feel but I also can’t tell the 12 and 13 year olds that cuz they literally don’t know shit haha
Middleschoolteachers,"Put the students in the auditorium, media center and cafeteria with one of each of our three middle school assistants.  Same as the rest of the year."
Middleschoolteachers,"I definitely understand. For what it's worth, my wife made the move from middle school to elementary a couple years after our first kid was born. It could be unique to her situation and where she ended up \[we literally live 2 minutes from her school\], but she seemed to think it was much less emotionally taxing on her.  


The only other thing I could really say is that it's your first year - and that's probably the most stressful on a teacher. I went into it eyes wide open because of my wife as a second career at 40. I felt the whole time like my kids simply weren't learning - and navigating the how-tos of running a class were frustrating to me. Things are much better, and I'm half way through year six now.  


If you don't need the job/benefits right now, yeah definitely you can always go back. The teacher shortage is real."
Middleschoolteachers,"I’ve taught 6-12. 9-12 for 7 years and 6-8 for 4. I would take 6-8 over high school all day! I really didn’t enjoy high school the way I thought I would. 

I think it’s different for everyone based on what makes you click. I also think you need some time in one age range before you really get a feel for it to decide if it does or doesn’t work. I struggled with my middle schoolers at first but once I figure them out I realized my teaching style and personality is a much better natural fit for them than high school"
Middleschoolteachers,"I actually got into teaching as a second career after 30 years as a designer in the corporate world and I love teaching. Now I teach part time for a school in China and at a local college. I also tutor which I highly recommend! If you like education go for it, know that there are many things that you can do with those skills. I never taught elementary though, always middle school through college."
Middleschoolteachers,"Fix your own issues. Fund your own schools.

You vote down your property taxes and then you bitch that the rest of us are teaching real content instead of middle school to 11th graders.

Last time you guys dragged us down it fucked over our schools. No more. It's a federal system."
Middleschoolteachers,"I experience a fair number of gifted students who have skated through our school system's elementary and middle schools. Most of our students come from extreme poverty and homes where their parents, when present, have no respect for school. Ultimately, the teachers end up focusing so much on the struggling students who need all the extra help that they often ignore the gifted students, who by comparison, seem super smart although they're really not. When they come to me, many of them openly tell me they've never had to study in their lives because there was no rigor involved, and they never really had to do any homework. They also have realized by high school that most of their teachers never actually read their work or offer feedback so they don't view assignments as anything more than busy work that isn't important. When I get them, they suddenly realize they are not as smart as all their prior teachers told them they were \[a phrase I hear them say often themselves\] - and when they struggle with my subject, many of them just give up early because they've never experienced struggle."
Middleschoolteachers,"I knew I wanted to teach from 4th grade. I teach middle school social studies.  While the content doesn’t change, every day is a new adventure. I think it’s fine that you are doing this as an interim. It’s a lot of work, a lot of stress, but I still love it. You never know, you may never leave! 

All teachers are in demand, but consider ELL, it’s a very in demand teaching speciality right now, or perhaps a reading specialist position like OG or Wilson.

Read up on your states’ licensing requirements and standards to be taught. Google your state and department of education or some thing similar.  And if you’re not in the US, then however your country’s education is decided; province or country or district or what have you."
Middleschoolteachers,"This was closer to my experience as well. Couple that with a tiny apartment with mo desk/table, 2 cats and an SO. I need to at least have access to my classroom-teaching middle school level math with just one computer was not great."
Middleschoolteachers,"I understand, I'm also a mother of three and teach middle school. I don't know what to do... I love teaching, but also I feel I don't have enough time after work to spend with my family. 
I'm moving to a new City in June and I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a position, or if I should change jobs... I'd love to have a science related job, but no idea where to start..
 I'm sorry I can't offer advice. But I can tell you you are not alone. Happy new year!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Do the students have to take any kind of 8th grade science test? I'm not sure what No Child Left behind tests are actually federally required in middle school.  If they do have some kind of test, the children will score very poorly and that will reflect badly on the school. This is how the super Jesusy public school that I taught at my first year got away wiith teaching evolution."
Middleschoolteachers,"Each state adopts a list of content standards: things students should know in each subject. 

Then each district in a state adopts a curriculum (mostly just a textbook). That textbook has lessons to teach all of standards in a particular way in a particular order. 

Elementary: grade level teams

Secondary: subject level departments (some also have grade level teams, especially middle school)"
Middleschoolteachers,"Seriously. That's your evidence for why it's okay? How about all the teachers on here telling you exactly what I just told you: do not add minors on social media? How are their voices not enough to convince you that it is wrong? Along with all the downvotes your comments trying to excuse your behavior gets.

There is NO reason for a non-relative adult to follow a child on social media. Especially given that your ex-students are **middle school age. So** ***barely*** **teenagers.** You are creepy and weird to follow them and you **know** deep down it is creepy and weird, hence why you even posted this question. No one asks ""is this okay?"" unless there's a voice in the back of their head telling them ""NO!!!""

Imagine how these **minors**' parents would think of you if they knew an **adult male** was listed as their child's ""friend"" online and would occasionally leave ""supportive"" comments on their videos. You really think they're going to be okay with that? Because the answer is no, and you know it's no.

Don't try to excuse your creepy behavior with ""but other people--!"" because other people do a whole lot of stupid things and just because ""other people"" do it online does not make it permissible."
Middleschoolteachers,Should people or machines go to space is a good one I just did with my middle schoolers. I teach 7th but on Newsela if your school has it the articles scaled up to a 9-10 grade level.
Middleschoolteachers,Oh no! Luckily I haven't had to deal with parents tooooo much. How did that go!? Does it just come in the territory of teaching middle school?
Middleschoolteachers,I am a high school math teacher. I chose high school because I only wanted to teach one subject. I knew in elementary I’d have to teach all subjects and at our middle school we’d have to teach 2 subjects. I just want math all day. I also like the age group vs the younger age groups.
Middleschoolteachers,Middle school kids suck.  High school is so much better.  Tell Mr. E to get out of middle school
Middleschoolteachers,I love the middle school kids!  ❤️
Middleschoolteachers,"I’ve taught 7th - 12th and I can honestly tell you that unless you want to teach little kids, an education degree is a waste of money. I teach chemistry because it’s actually easier than middle school because I know the subject from having a minor in it in college. Since I have a science degree, I have the option to leave the education field, go to school for 1 year and become a RN for little money/effort. I also have the option to teach 11th graders and not be stuck teaching the younger age group. If I actually wanted to torture myself teaching middle schoolers, I have that option too. Education degrees limit your job prospects.

I’ve always been effective and highly effective in my evaluations with a biology degree + the 4 easy education classes that I BS’ed on University of Phoenix over the summer."
Middleschoolteachers,I made cameras on as a must. I did middle school PE. Some students did well. Some did not pass but we moved them along to the next grade anyway. I gave out a ton of virtual dollars (fake money) and used that to allow them to skip workouts. NGL it was very tough.
Middleschoolteachers,"Oh yeah, I made it a point to elaborate on the ""you have to get above a D to pass classes"" thing because many of the kids couldn't believe it.

I think not failing kids in middle school, or even like 4th or 5th grade, does a great disservice to kids but not prepping them for the possibility of academic failure.  Then they get to 9th grade, with a lot of bad habits already set in, and they can't adjust."
Middleschoolteachers,"Yup.  All through elementary and middle school it didn’t matter a bit if you got straight Fs on your report card.  You _might_ catch some grief from your parents if they were on the ball (but so many parents are essentially absent) 

Then bang, in high school it’s suddenly very very real.  If a kid takes longer than one semester to figure this out, and many do, he’s not going to graduate.  To no one’s surprise, he’ll drop out at 18."
Middleschoolteachers,"There is a book series called taking sides that you can possibly use. Probably too advanced for middle school students, though."
Middleschoolteachers,I stopped enforcing cell phone policy. Parents are sending their middle schoolers to school with THE MOST ENTERTAINING DEVICE EVER CREATED IN HUMAN HISTORY in their pocket. And they expect me to regulate their child’s cell phone usage during class? Fuck that. My parents didn’t send me to school with my gameboy. And a gameboy pails in comparison to the entertainment of a smart phone. This is 100% on parents.
Middleschoolteachers,"See I’m of the opposite mindset. I used to be a real stickler about late and missing work. I had a comprehensive sliding scale for how many points off corresponding to the number of days it was late with a strict cutoff after 5 days. I don’t think it increased the sense of urgency to turn things in for my middle school kids. And truth be told it was a lot to keep track of too. 

One day I spoke with my old AP about it and he really turned my head around on the issue. He didn’t believe in points off for late work since the grade you assign isn’t based on the timeliness of the work, it’s based on the assessment of the skill. It took me until we went fully remote to implement the policy I have now. 

I no longer take off any points for late work turned in, because the mere fact that they’re turning anything in should be encouraged and celebrated, not punished. Not to mention the fact that most of the kids who turned in late work were the ones who needed the extra points the most. Especially during a pandemic, I realized that life was still happening for these kids at home, a lot of which I didn’t realize. They could’ve had family members sick or dying and there I would be harping on a late comprehension assignment. It treats our students more like people rather than cogs in a machine or numbers on a spreadsheet. 

I still preach deadlines to them, but I give them until a week before the end of the quarter to finish any assignment we’ve done. Most who wait until then have sealed their fate, but they do so knowing that they had plenty of chances to do it. I also make sure the parents know about my policy so there’s no excuses for why an assignment wasn’t turned in. Beyond that, it also is another box I can check for how I accommodated their students’ needs in a way beyond just teaching style. 

Some may say this is a detriment; I respectfully disagree. It’s giving our kids a chance to be seen as humans with real lives and problems. We can’t preach mental health all the time and then turn around and send mixed messages to our students through our policies too. Procrastination culture is a thing because our society is one that values productivity, but our worth and our students’ worth is inherent even without all of that."
Middleschoolteachers,Very often and surprisingly at the middle school level.
Middleschoolteachers,"I think this depends what you teach, and how many students. 

For example, this year (and last), I have taught English and Social Studies to two groups of seventh grade students. I have about 45-50 kids (kids come and go as the year progresses). 

I absolutely do no work outside my contract hours on a regular basis. This year I did spend about an hour doing report cards on a Sunday, but those could have been done Friday at work - I just gave my students a few extra days to catch up if needed. But other than that, I haven’t brought any work home. I arrive to work about 25 mins early by choice and socialize with coworkers. I leave at contract time. 

But I’m sure if I taught elementary school and was self-contained, this wouldn’t be possible. It also was a lot more difficult when I was teaching 180 students (I did that a few years ago), because there’s a lot more to grade. Less to plan though, since I was only teaching one subject. 

I plan during my prep and grade while students work. It is 100% doable as a middle school teacher. I’m in my seventh year. Its the only reason I’m sane and still in the profession. I pulled long hours as a first, second and third year teacher and have no interest in doing that now. My life is not my job."
Middleschoolteachers,"Let me guess.  Middle school? When I first got into teaching, it was traumatic. I was always with the popular group in my own high school years so it shocked me how these kids would read me. Like “tf. I just met you, you little shit”.  But I started to work on myself spiritually and really realize that as a teacher, I have the power to create the world I want to live in. I can create joy, love and peace. Now, I freely and openly compliment my students about their style, their intelligence, their resilience, etc. I have also learned to take their insults as jokes. “Why yes, I do think I’m all that with my oompa-looking ass 😂”.  To last, we really do need to develop thick skin. It helps to know that these insults come from a dark place and from their own deep insecurities. It’s up to us to allow kindness to shed light and love. Also, if you are in middle school, it just is a hell hole.  Switching to high school where there are actual natural consequences for those who take things to far is a big plus."
Middleschoolteachers,"Retired teacher and sober alcoholic here.    
Many teachers do drink, and there seems to be assumption that all teachers (especially in higher grades) drink.  But it's not true, though a lot of socializing revolves around alcohol.    


My experience is that some of my colleagues (especially when I taught Kindergarten) just didn't like alcohol.  They weren't alcoholic, they just didn't drink.  Whereas when I taught middle school far more of the teachers drank, though mostly not to excess.  But yes, there are untreated alcoholics among teachers, just like there are untreated (and sober) alcoholics in any profession, whether it's nursing, dock workers, chefs, or whatever.    


Teaching is waaaaay easier sober."
Middleschoolteachers,"I agree with the constant disrespect and how our power to hold them accountable has been diminished.  My last school had detention, this school does not. We can ask them to regocus write a reflection, contact parents, restate expectations,coach them, praise the positive, change seating chart and write a conduct referral. This does not work with escalating behaviors. ISI is the consequence from admin but there is no foresight or guidance beyond them staying in the room for a day or two. Some kids have 5 or more major conduct referrals, serious violence on the bus, fights, destroying school property, and harrassing/bullying others. 

The fact that admins answer is to question my toutines and management each time. I have been told, ""if it was me I would think why they are acting this way in my class instead of Mr. S."" 
""Ask yourself, are you managing or micromanaging ""
""Ask yourself why students feel the need to record you""
""If there is professional conduct,  there should be no concern from your part""

""We need to talk about your conduct towards this student....""

Reach out to parents or yeah, thats a minor behavior and teacher managed. Even if its repetitive and ongoing....there is just ""oh yeah""

I have only had two walkthroughs. No specific feedback just vague, oh Im seeing good things, I can see you put in work at the beginning of the year. 

When teachers are exhausted and struggling it behooves admin to lean in and listen harder.

Also, lesson plans, seating charts and quick 5 minute walkthroughs do not give a picture of the day to day live interactions and having to be on high alert. We deal things that are unpredictable and kids who are affected by each other and the environment. It's bullshit....because you cant see that in a stupid lesson plan layout. 

The parents want to deflect from their kids behavior, its the teacher, the other kids, the school, Tiktok....what is not being said is that kids should be held accountable for their choices and what is the plan to do that. What is the kids role, their consequence,  their reward....it is not me as a professional that should be questioned about my conduct.

Being new to the school still, I dont have some established relationships with other teachers, some report similar behaviors but it seems an impossible task as a middle school teacher to ask them all for input. Its not a very welcoming community."
Middleschoolteachers,"I don't know when it became commonplace for kids to be tuned into their peers inner thoughts 24/7 ... but it's definitely not making kids smarter.   


I didn't get my son a phone until he was 16. He was one of maybe two kids throughout middle school and two full years of high school without a phone. He can also have actual conversations with people too."
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes! Thank you for the long post! 

 So many parents don't understand how problematic phones can be, particularly when it comes to nudes and porn. I speak to HS kids who tell me they often get unsolicited nudes from kids they then have to sit in class with. I ask them what they should do &amp; they generally have adopted the attitude of a big shrug, because it is so commonplace and because there is no good solution-- at a small school like ours I shudder to think of how we would assign all the kids we would have to reassign to separate sections of a class.

I definitely tell middle school students very clearly not to send nudes-- then pray they will listen. I feel lucky to have admin who support this and will run interference should any parent think their child is too young to hear it."
Middleschoolteachers,"I second this!  

I'm in complete agreement.  \* 

Yes! 

1. I do not work more than 30 - 50 minutes outside of my contract hours except I get to work 15 minutes prior because I like to and I will stay 30-45 minutes past to finish grading tests.  MATH &lt; time grading. ^(\*\* if you have an idea, agree or argument see below.)

2.  Students and families can contact me at work and do not answer emails or even look at them when you are not in your classroom. Start this early from the very beginning. It's a boundary that needs to be established in the beginning.  Do not relax your boundary.  If you do you will never get it back again.  

3. This is already in 1 &amp; 2.\*\*\*  4. &amp; 5. are great and I thought they were common sense so I I have one more...  NO WATERCOOLER TALK! NO HALLWAY TALK!  I hear teachers wasting MINUTES, up to 30, 40, 50 minutes or more talking in the hallway while I'm grading, planning, prepping, etc. in my classroom almost ready to go home. And the teachers in the hallway are always staying late because they spend too much time talking in the hallway. Dumb!

\*For 25 years I have been a middle school teacher, math specialist, educator, etc. and I have successfully kept my work and it's hours separate and at school on school time.  Not mine.  Yes, I teach math and it's also the reason I never clock more than 50 hours at school each week.  And I'm really, may be, making that number a little high so I don't look like a louse but I'm really, good at my job.  And I enjoy my job because I'm able to balance work and personal time and have a healthy lifestyle.

\*\*1.  I only grade tests because students start HW in class and correct it themselves the next day.  I help them when they are learning the material and taking notes and when the working class before they leave.  I know before they leave the classroom who needs assistance and who doesn't, who needs differentiation and who doesn't. Before they've left the room I know how am I going to modify or accommodate each student and/or adjust my plans for the next day? And I don't have a problem with cheating due to my low score policy; students who score a D or F (below 60%) on any test, homework, or assignment I give they can fix the ones they missed and turn it back in for a better grade.  (They know this policy is not applicable to district or state testing. There's no need to cheat in my classroom the whole point is for you to learn from the mistake. It's middle school who cares if they get a chance to do it over again. 

\*\*\*I do not work more than my contracted hours, do not give out my personal contact info so why would I be checking work email?  Maybe someone would if they used work email for personal use which is asking for trouble.  Don't do it not even just once.   I declared the first and second laws so I don't have to deal with work outside of work. 

If you're spending too much time at work you did not set healthy boundaries between work and personal life and you probably don't have a personal life which means you probably don't have a very healthy lifestyle either. There needs to be separation between work and personal life.  It is healthy. We all know the teacher that never leaves school. That puts on the play every year from Broadway or has the math club annual special Olympics for everyone in the district... That's not healthy. Nobody wants to be you. You don't even want to be you!! That's what you spend all your time at school doing stuff for other people to look at yourself.  It's not healthy!"
Middleschoolteachers,"Our district went virtual about two weeks ago for a bit, teachers found out in the same overhead announcement as the students.  

I flat out ask my students (middle school) to tell me anything they hear because 50% of the time they know before I do."
Middleschoolteachers,"Honestly, I just stopped caring about this. Yes, I think a student that does nothing should get a zero. But if giving them 50% by default makes my life easier... I'm also in middle school, not credit-bearing high school classes, so take my thought with a grain of salt."
Middleschoolteachers,I had 2 who did it by accident in middle school and then it stuck for their remaining time at schook (so 8th grade and they kept it going until 10th/11th grade when they transferred) and another one was just a sweet person who saw me as their school mom.
Middleschoolteachers,"In middle school, I don’t get called Mom hardly ever, but I have been called by the name of every Core and Science teacher we have! 😂😂😂 I love it when they use a coworker’s name I’ve never been called before."
Middleschoolteachers,"Great points. Its funny that you say teachers should never create curriculum from scratch, because thats literally how every lesson plan i have done so far in college has been assigned. Every education class has had us look up standards online, and use those to make a lesson plan following the university lesson plan format. In my final field experience observing a middle school history class, my mentoring teacher laughed about how he used almost nothing from his college education classes. Since i heard him say that, ive been checking this reddit sub for advice every day. I feel like that’s the best way to prepare at this point"
Middleschoolteachers,"It was not an easy childhood.  His mother probably had the same personality disorder he does (one rooted in anxiety).  They get worse over time.  We met in college at ages 19 and 20 in 1988.  I had a happy childhood with mentally stable, empathetic parents who focused on allowing their children privacy and independence.  He grew up in a household where privacy and boundaries were not respected.  He was mercilessly bullied through middle school by students in a white supremacist gang who went on to beat a Somali immigrant to death.  (Teachers and other adults did not supervise or intervene in bullying the way we are trained to do today.)

At age 19 (when we met) and at age 32 (when I married) I did not have the tools or language to understand his trauma, or that it wasn't just sufficient to have grown up and moved out of his parents' house. He had therapy but his therapists would drop him for ""lack of progress"" which I only learned recently they were obligated to do out of professional ethics, but they never told me (when we did couples therapy) that the reason was a personality disorder.  This would have been helpful to know in 2000 and 2008 (when we sought couples counseling).  Our culture has shifted in the meantime, and there is better education about boundaries, the nature of abuse, trauma, and personality disorders.  

Not to hijack the OP's orignal post!!  

There is no need to put up with disrespect from your marriage partner.  If they can't be a partner, cut your losses.  If you have children, you may realize like I did that you couldn't even protect them by living under the same roof as your spouse,  that it was easier and better finally to divorce."
Middleschoolteachers,"One of the first things I talk to my middle school classes is the definition of child porn and how having it on your phone constitutes a crime. 

Unfortunately, I think the solution requires a strong administration that supports teachers and we don't have that around here."
Middleschoolteachers,"I want to teach in the USA, currently teaching in the U.K., but I need more years of practice before I can apply. Also, it’s really hard to find jobs for a teacher like me (French, German high school/middle school) since the subjects aren’t in demand. 

Although I’m starting to think it might be a really bad idea! Teaching in the U.K. is already pretty poor, I currently earn like 27k and if I move regions next year I’ll take a pay cut to 25k."
Middleschoolteachers,"What grade will you be working with? 

Older kids, middle school and up, you can just be honest with them. ""I really struggled with my mental health when I was younger, but I got help and am doing better now. Thank you for asking."" 

Younger kids, you probably want to be a little more vague. ""Oh, I got hurt there was I was younger. They are all healed now!"" 

In general, you dont need to share anything that makes you uncomfortable.  As you said, long sleeves are an option if you feel really uncomfortable with the idea of it coming up."
Middleschoolteachers,"Personally, I’ve found people who don’t like HS teaching positions will hate MS even more. In general middle schoolers are still more “childish” (I use that term loosely as every school and student is different,) and it takes a strong presence and plan to teach it. But if you like it better then why not? When I switched it was rough all those years ago, but I still enjoy it way more."
Middleschoolteachers,"I fundamentally agree with the OP. However, anything Language arts-based is a notoriously heavy marking load. I have tremendous sympathy for those that teach this subject, and I think there aren’t any real “shortcuts” as far as marking goes that wouldn’t hurt the students. I understand you are at the college level, but I think this is also true for middle school and junior high. My principal kept trying to pressure me into teaching LA for a year and I refused outright every time. Many things about this job make me want to quit, but the marking required if I taught LA would be what pushes me over the edge to hand in my resignation."
Middleschoolteachers,"Japan has that. My school runs so much like a Japanese middle school (students are in cohorts for instance). The only difference is that they move from class to class instead of teachers (this is possible: I went to a 7-12 school for 7-8 in which teachers had a giant room which students weren't allowed in and moved from room to room for the students. The only issue is that we may not have space for that?) and students aren't responsible for cleaning. (While I understand why we don't do that, I would love it if the kids had to clean more often.)"
Middleschoolteachers,"I agree with your pluses and minuses for high school! Many of the kids have a fixed mindset and it sometimes is hard to teach them. My principal and assistant principal have been so kind, patient, and good to me that it kind of makes it hard to go, but my heart is telling me middle school 😅"
Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, I was certified in MS Math and I can’t remember what the school website said under vacancies (whether it said ‘Secondary Math Teacher’ , ‘MS Math Teacher’ , or ‘HS Math Teacher’) but I applied for the job. At the end of the interview the principal persuaded me to teach high school. I work for a public school district and we have two middle schools 6-8 and two high schools 9-12."
Middleschoolteachers,"Echoing everything said above, I had to spend more time teaching middle schoolers how to be human, which was tedious at times.  No, you can't scream randomly in the middle of class.  Yes, spoiling a movie that just came out is a chump move.  Also, a big thing for me, but varies by district, was the change in building schedule.  When I taught middle school I taught 6 total classes a day, 4 courses.  Teaching modified block at high school, I'm down to 2-3 classes a day (100 minute classes) and 1-2 courses a day, making my planning much easier.

Middle Schoolers just still remembered how to have fun, and I miss the hell out of that.  For me, nothing could get me to go back, however, as the budgetary differences are monumental, and for an elective teacher, that's crucial."
Middleschoolteachers,Wait. Were you certified in middle school math and they made you teach HS math? It is illegal according to law. Are you in private school where middle and high schoolers are mixed? Just want some clarification.
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and it happens a few times a year. One year I had a kid call me mom at least once a week all year. It got to be really funny because it was an accident every time. I started calling him my son in response and he loved it. I thought it was sweet because that also tells me he probably talks to his mom a lot and I think a lot of parents don't actually talk to their kids that much.

I understand it. People just get in the habit of saying certain things when they get talking. I have accidentally called my best friend ""Honey"" when I get excited and lots of people have ended a conversation with ""I love you"" out of habit. A little embarrassing but not too bad, at least as an adult."
Middleschoolteachers,"LOL  it happens.   With the little guys, I usually let it go.  If it's middle school or high school, it's generally an insult...  I just look at them with the best teacher look I can... the ""really"" look..."
Middleschoolteachers,"Telling admin you want a transfer, if your district is full on K-12, should be pretty easy.   You also can start looking for the middle school jobs that are opening and contact HR when they will be posted.  I would get in contact with that principal of the middle school and let them know you would love to be interviewed.  Honestly, finding middle school teachers is generally harder.   There are pluses and minuses to each.  I taught both and loved the middle schoolers, but, you have to be ""the teacher in charge"" from the beginning.   They have a hard time adjusting to anyone new after an original teacher gets them going.  I loved high school JR and SR's because they knew ""the light was at the end of the tunnel"".   They were more focused and easier to get back if they went sideways.    The 9th graders were ""deer in the headlights"" for 1/2 the year and it was hard to get them going for the high school work.   I did not like 10th grade.  They seemed like the lost ones.  Not close enough to smell graduation, but, past, the nonsense of middle school ( and 9th).    If Middle school is calling you, then you should work to get there!!!"
Middleschoolteachers,If you can get a middle school accelerated position I think you would like it. Middle school algebra is my absolute favorite to teach
Middleschoolteachers,"""Over a decade of teaching"", so you mean to tell me even in your early years you didn't lesson plan at home, grade work, or enter scores in a grade book? Did you have little ones at home at the time? I'm at the point where if I don't do some work at home, my students won't have a lesson for the next day. What am I to do in these early years? Tell my students ""hey I don't have any lessons for you, so I'm going to use class time to plan some for this week. Please don't screw around."" It would be chaos.

I'm middle school ELA, and the only one in my department, so I don't think it will fly if I try that approach. Yes life goes on, with or without me; a replaceable teacher. I also live in a state where tenure is not guaranteed at any point so it feels like a daily battle just to fight for my job. I'm still developing curriculum for my new school and adjusting it to my own style and preferences. It. Just. Takes. Time.

I think I'm hard on myself because of the unrealistic expectations placed on teachers and how I know all of what I just wrote to be true in my situation. The contract is not going to change unless I leave schools, and right now that's just not feasible for several reasons. So I need to make due with this current position.

Any other English teachers have tips for how to not work themselves into the ground?"
