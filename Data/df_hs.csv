highschoolteachers,"I am a high school science teacher in Florida at a public school. 

We only offer Spanish and only have a Spanish club (no other foreign languages). 

Our students also only get exposed to Spanish in middle school. 

We also do not have anyone who comes to talk about study abroad. I have had some students talk to me about how to though because I did 3x in undergrad. If they are going to college, I tell them to talk to their advisor. If they aren't, I teach them about the Work Away website that's really popular. "
highschoolteachers,"Here's my view. I know it's going to be unpopular, and I'm pretty sure it's not going to change any minds, but here it is. 

I don't think a high school coach should worry about having a winning team or making the playoffs. Yes, of course, encourage the students to strive for that, train them, motivate them, help them. Do everything you can to get the students there, because you're teaching them appropriate skills while you do so.

I know you also mentioned a course overload, but the first thing you mentioned was football, and your disappointment in the quality of your team. You mention your courseload, but almost as an aside. It seems to me that football is your most important criterion. 

But the team isn't **for** you. It's for the students. If you have a football team of 30 motivated kids who do their best and still enjoy the game but end up with losing seasons year after year, *you've done your job.*

The team isn't meant to be a means for you to express your superior coaching skills to your coaching colleagues, it's meant to teach the kids the value of teamwork, to provide a physical fitness opportunity and a physical outlet, to teach leadership and followership and sportsmanship. But at the end of the day, it's an *extra*curricular activity. No one needs it to graduate.

Imagine if an English teacher decided to move on because the debate team just couldn't win debates. Or the science teacher moved on because the robotics team's robots didn't win competitions.

If the coach of my son's football team left because the team wasn't competitive, I'd be glad to see him go."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school there were a bunch of bomb threats. One time there was an actual bomb... Or at least a 'device'. 

When I student taught shelter in places over suspicious people were pretty normal. 

It's not trivial, but, it's not much of an event."
highschoolteachers,"I just finished my last year of teaching French and German at a high school in rural Missouri. I teach French 1-4 and German 1-2. I taught college before high school.

-In the ""city"" districts, students can start learning French in middle school. But in rural districts, French is only offered at high school, and sometimes not at all.

-We offer French 1, 2, 3, 4

-The Spanish program at my school has around 225 students between all levels. I had 75 students in French this past year.

-We offer French, Spanish, and German

-We do not have a culture class, but I incorporate elements of culture into all levels.

-The Rotary Club organizes study abroad in my school. Students rarely seem to study abroad. However, we always have 2 or 3 exchange students from abroad in our school every year.

-We have a French club. We meet every other week after school for an hour or so. We play games, listen to music, cook traditional French foods, and take some field trips."
highschoolteachers,"I like the age group better.  They are energetic and excitable.  They are figuring themselves out and they are going through puberty (which brings about its own unique challenges lol).  Their brains are still developing and they usually aren't jaded yet.  I taught in high school and hated it; I've been doing middle schools for 5 years now and I love it.  

It's not always bad to be teaching something you're not 100% comfortable with.  It's a nice challenge and pulls you out of your comfort zone.  I used to teach 8th when I started (physical science) and it forced me to learn new things and challenge myself.  "
highschoolteachers,"My district did PBL for about 4 years, beginning with 4th/5th grades and working up to 9th grade. The year that the 9th grade cohort did PBL (students who had done PBL classes through middle school), it fell apart completely. They got to high school, where credits and state testing affect graduation, and it turns out that a ton of the students were way behind on basic skills. When it was implemented at the high school, most of the teachers, even for non-PBL subjects, thought it was a bad idea, because it was full PBL, on graduation-tested subjects. High-performing students complained about it. Low-performing students passed units and failed exams (both district and state). The program was scrapped at the end of the year.

I teach art, which by its very nature is PBL. Projects are great, allow for hands-on demonstration and real-world connections. The issue is when students lack the fundamental basic skills necessary to do the task. All of my units have indepedent practice, teacher-led demonstrations, follow-me type activities, and guided brainstorming before the project begins. Students know what the long-term goal is before all of these activities begin, so that they know the reason that they're being required to, for example, draw all of the parts of the face separately.

Thinking about my students and their classes, and my experience as a student in AP classes, I would be really surprised if all of them can actually be trusted to work collaboratively. I have one student this year who is highly gifted, very smart, but is the biggest bully and slacker in my class. He is borderline failing due to his behavior.

In my opinion, it would be better to simply incorporate more real-world projects into the existing curriculum in place of some of the higher-level independent activities that you would normally use. Additionally, the fewer group projects, the better (in my biased opinion). Group projects allow students to hide their lack of comprehension until it is too late, and over-burdens the students who want to get good grades."
highschoolteachers,"In Vegas we had this happen about two or three months ago at a high school.  I'm getting the impression this is the new normal
"
highschoolteachers,"What class do you teach currently and in which state / which classes have you taught and in which states?

I teach math in Texas.

At what age do students in your state have the opportunity to start learning French?

No one in my school learns French. If they go to a really large high school, they might have the opportunity to learn french in 9th grade. I started french classes in the 11th grade.

How many years of French are available?

None at my school. At really large high schools, the most I've seen is 4.

What percentage of students choose French?
It's not offered in most schools. In my high school there was one French class of 30 for every 1000 kids. 


Which languages are offered?
Spanish is the only language most Texas high schools can afford to offer. 

Does your school provide classes (or a section/chapter of a class) that teach French culture and/or history?
No.

Do you know of any groups or organizations that come into your school to advertise exchange or study abroad programs?
We host foreign exchange students, but I don't think we've ever sent any anywhere. 

Is there a French club at your school? What do they do?
There isn't even a Spanish club at my school. There's no money. "
highschoolteachers,"-I am a French teacher in Michigan.

-There isn't a state law about when you can start taking French; it varies by district.  In our district it's only offered at the high school level.  Others start in middle school, and a few at the elementary level.

-French is offered for all four years.

-Around 10% of the student body is taking a French class.  (This amounts to about 25% of those taking a foreign language.)

-Only Spanish and French are offered.

-I work culture and history into the classes, but there isn't an explicit ""French culture"" class.

-I regularly am contacted by travel agencies that propose travel.  I have gone to France myself with students before.

-There is no French club.  I think there was one before my time.  I think it basically just focused on French cuisine."
highschoolteachers,"I wanted to think about this overnight because it really made me think.  As an Edu. student one of the reasons that drew me to the field was dealing with kids straight out of high school that were not delivering the quality of work that I would have expected in a university setting.  My greatest goal as an educator is I want to have students that can be decisive and confidently deliver their thoughts in the real world.  I have started to see the value of doing creative group projects, however I still strongly believe that it is as important that they be able to write clearly and concisely to deliver a point, then be able to orally support the argument in the face of dissension.  Thank you for well thought out post!! "
highschoolteachers,"I gave it two years. After the first year, I was a little unsure if teaching was for me. After the second year, I was 100% sure that teaching high school wasn't for me."
highschoolteachers,"I taught several years in college while I was getting my Master's, and even after. Because of better benefits and stable employment, I started teaching high school. 

I lasted two years before I couldn't take it anymore. Finished my last day a week ago. I miss the good kids, but don't miss the bad ones. I have no desire to be a parent myself, nor do I feel like correcting a bad parent's lack of parenting. 99% of the behavior problems I faced were due to crappy parents.

Student behavior was the biggest reason, but I also got tired of making lesson plans, grading, and contacting parents on my own time. With an 8-5 job, you are done when you leave at 5.

I'm getting back into higher education and am starting in just a few weeks. I've never been happier."
highschoolteachers,"I'm  4'11 and also very young looking. It's all about having a big presence. That pulls in a lot of the other advice you've gotten (projecting confidence, dressing the part, good posture, etc.) My mantra before I let the kiddos in my classroom is ""I *own* this room. I *own* this room. I *own* this room.""

I teach high school, and I've had students try to loom over me and try to intimidate me. When I didn't back up and looked them straight back in the eye the class realized they couldn't bulldoze me. 

Also, sometimes it takes a ""sacrificial lamb""- make an example of one kid the first few days of school and kids get the picture. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I am a high school math teacher, and I teach seniors (17/18 year olds). [...] a ton of people I meet make disgusting jokes about boys staring at my ass and having crushes/sexual fantasies on me. [...] I find it repulsive &amp; pedophilic.

Please look up the definition of pedophilia, because this certainly is not that. Neither is it, in itself, repulsive. It is natural for teenagers to experience sexual attraction and to have crushes and fantasies. Please don't shame their sexuality. 

That said, it needs to be stressed it is **inappropriate** because of the power dynamic between students and teachers, because it is unprofessional, and because (in most places) it is illegal."
highschoolteachers,"Congratulations! For me the hardest thing was changing my expectations of what they can do. What a high school lab report should look like vs a middle school one, that sort of thing. Working with the rest of your team should help you figure out where they expect them to be at that age for that sort of thing.

(In case you are wondering about my flair I went from middle to high school to middle to high school and back to middle.)"
highschoolteachers,"Also in Canada, I teach Phys Ed so I actually cover other teachers prep time but I also hear it used to mean a different class to prep for. In high school its a more common term because there are so many different possible classes. "
highschoolteachers,"Good work! I'm in my 4th year as a middle school and high school social studies teacher.  I've got six preps as well (7th-12th grade) and it was terrifying everyday my first year with nothing to go on (I'm the only social studies teacher in the district, yeah small school...) but it only gets better from here! Now you can really build off of your work this year. "
highschoolteachers,"Title 1 is also secondary, I teach at a Title 1 high school"
highschoolteachers,"Currently teach, but daydream (and have been laying the groundwork) about leaving and focus on developing my own business ventures. My wife already runs a growing (and profitable) home business that I am also pretty invested in when I'm not at work (ok, I lie, I do stuff for the business all the time at work).

We can't grow any faster with our current set up given we have 4 children (3 of which are still at home), so it makes little sense for me to leave my teaching job before they are all in school, given I would end up just taking care of my kids while my wife works. Since I'm the primary breadwinner, that's just not feasible...and nevermind the benefits.

I want to get out of this ASAP, I don't mind the job, but I don't feel any passion for it, and it seems like I'm rowing upstream with my attitude toward the whole thing. So much of it seems pointless and archaic that I just don't want to be a contributor to this bullshit anymore.

I like, even love, most of my students (and players that I coach), but I'm not really that interested in the well-being of my students with regards to my subject (I teach high school ELA - it came easy to me, as most things related to school). I enjoy reading and critical thinking exercises, but don't care if any of them feel the same way as I do.

I just feel that I'm not a positive force in this mindless system and I want out ASAP. Would rather create things that people might buy, and work toward living a life that is location independent. Basically, fuck this noise."
highschoolteachers,"No, mainly because I moved states after graduating and getting married. I probably wouldn't have interviewed at the school even if I had stayed, though. It was a middle school placement and I prefer high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I understand. I've been mistaken for an elementary school-aged child. I'll be 25 in July. I'm 5'1 and maybe 100 or so pounds, so most of the 5th graders tower over me. *sigh* But, it's not impossible and I've even applied to work in a high school. 

Overall, you get your respect like other teachers do. You are assertive, professional and consistent. Students do not automatically respect those that are/look older than them. Speak loudly and firmly, be direct in your objectives, and don't back down. That being said, build rapport with your students, find out things they like. 

If you respect them, you will garner respect as well. Be friendly with your students but do not be their ""friends."" Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"My first career was 4 years (20-24) at an ad agency. I worked there during my last year of college and then graduated right before I turned 21. I liked it but hated it. Advertising can be engaging and interesting, but it's soul-sucking. It paid better. I still do some work on the side sometimes for events and such. 

I'm teaching now but before we changed states (really can make a difference), I had to quit for a few years. I worked in HR/Event Management for a company, and it was an awesome job -- a lot of autonomy, work from home, flex time (salaried but if I had to work 60 hours for a big event, I got the 20 hours back wherever it made sense/I wanted). 

When we moved, I heard the union in my district was decent (it is, and this matters so *much* to the quality of life as a teacher, I feel), so tried my hand at teaching again. I really like teaching for the lack of continuity (each year is a new thing); doing the same thing for too long doesn't work for me. The events job worked this way too, to a degree -- there were seasons and booms and slow periods and a sort of re-set at Christmas time -- but not as much, especially with the paperwork. 

I don't know -- I don't necessarily see myself teaching forever, so I've resolved myself to become an AP. The school calendar just makes sense to me somehow. 

As to your needs, I don't know: I teach English, but teaching doesn't feel related to my English degree at all. I imagine the same thing happens to Physics teachers. Granted, I teach middle (switching to high) so maybe that'll seem different next year in high school, but I'm not counting on it being about literature and writing and not 90% about coaching and classroom management. I think teaching is basically a people business, not a content business. Do you like dealing with people? Do you like problem solving? Are you good at convincing reluctant people to do what you want? Teaching is as much like sales as it is like anything, only you can be mostly confident that what you're selling is productive and positive, at least. "
highschoolteachers,"Yep, quit my job for a better commute, more holidays and an easier check. I work in a shitty high school where they let me do whatever I want because I bribe them with food and most of the kids don't care "
highschoolteachers,"Are you female?

Heels.  They don't have to be big heels.  They can be one-inch heels.  But the important thing is that they CLICK on the floor when you walk.

Are you male?

A tie.  Every day.

Dress is so important. As is faking confidence until you truly have it, and body posture.  Look up how prison guards and military leaders stand.  Mimic those poses.  

I am a 31 year old female who was recently mistaken for a high school student outside of work (I went to a store and asked for a teacher discount and they thought I was lying - I had to show my union membership card).  This doesn't happen in school any longer and people can hear me coming down the hallway.  The shoes that click on the floor do a lot for intimidation and reputation."
highschoolteachers,"K-5, I'm usually a high school teacher. But they have closed many schools in Philly, so little kids for now. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree, to an extent. I have pretty extensive content knowledge in my area (ELA) and it comes in handy. My classroom management style is basically deadpan ""what the fuck are you even doing right now."" I'm not great at keeping 6th-7th graders in line compared to high schoolers. The high schoolers I've worked with respect me, whereas the middle schoolers seem maybe afraid? Sometimes? Other times they're taller than I am and I get overrun. So why middle school, you ask? I just like them more. Their little brains are just beginning to open up and see new things. It's such a cool transitionary period. 

Today, I hugged a crying 6th grader because she was upset that her classmates were blatantly sexist and she couldn't stand the thought that there were people in the world who would tell her to step down because she's a girl (long story, kickball related). I hugged another crying 6th grader because his friend spit water on him. Then he laughed because I inadvertently touched his friend's spit by hugging him. Then there were four more that wanted hugs and joking about water-spitting. Feminist discussion followed immediately by spit jokes (sometimes fart jokes) THEY'RE AMAZING. And all so different. I love it.

High schoolers are cool too, and interesting, and challenging. I think if you love your students and know your shit, you just find where you fit best. Lateral movement. It might seem ""more"" that the AP English teacher next door is talking about Marxist theory, but we're paid the same and we love our jobs and our kids. I don't think I'd like her job as much, nor would she like mine (there is an amount of 12-year old spit-water and fart jokes that might be off putting to others). Just one middle school teacher's opinion."
highschoolteachers,"Middle schoolers are the bomb!! We had our end of the year kickball tournament today, and I had my middle schoolers in tears (laughing..probably) when I explained that they couldn't play the bigger kids yet because their arms and legs hadn't evened out 😂

Those goobers. I love them so much. PS I tried teaching high school and I sucked at it HOW DO YOU LIVE? "
highschoolteachers,"Yes, I received both a first and second interview at the high school where I student taught. My cooperating teacher was in on the interview, and the principal recognized me. (This was 2 years after I had student taught.) I felt much more relaxed during this interview compared to others because it felt more like a genuine conversation. I didn't get the job, but the principal took the time to explain why someone was chosen over me and gave me some great advice about interviewing. (I was super pissed, but I won't burn my bridges in case another job opens up!)"
highschoolteachers,"Not exactly.  There were two high schools in the district.  I student taught at school A but there were no openings  School B gave me an interview, but I did not get the job.

I probably would have worked there, the department was incredible, but I am so happy where I am now.  "
highschoolteachers,"Today was my last day at my high school. I'm leaving to be a financial planner with a national firm. 

It was a very hard decision to leave and saying goodbye to my students was much harder than I expected. I'm very optimistic of the opportunities that lay ahead.

Am I happier? I'm not sure yet. I can say that I'm excited about the idea of being able to grow professionally without having to get another degree that I can't afford for a couple thousand dollars a year pay raise.

I found myself thinking that while I loved what I did, I could see it getting old very fast. In East Tennessee, education is trying to spring back from several years of budgetary constraints, hiring freezes, stagnant wages, and inconsistent technology growth. My neighboring county just eliminated 5 SPED teachers and 11 instructional assistants. Shit, I taught SPED English, reading, algebra, and geometry without ANY books for 3 years. In October I began looking at what else might be out in the world for a former teacher and a few days later a friend reached it to me with an opportunity. 

I'll miss my school and my students, but education is under attack in this county and I need something that I can grow personally and professionally, make an impact, and provide a comfortable living for my family."
highschoolteachers,"You have to have a thick skin with children. They are testing boundaries by seeing what you will take. You gotta address the disrespect, but also let the natural rebellion behind your back roll off your shoulders. Students did it when I was in high school, and they'll continue to make fun of teachers until the end of time. 

You're an adult. They're children. Always keep that in your mind."
highschoolteachers,"No one shoved you into anything....it was something you ultimately decided on.  But, it sounds like you should not be doing it.

Just an FYI, gaming is a LOT of work and takes a lot of talent.  The people I know in gaming coding and design work 80+ hour weeks and are on call all the time.  They are also extremely talented...some of the best coders and most artistically talented people I know.  Have you ever programmed or designed games or just played them.  I just say this b/c I see a TON of students that desire to be game designers every year and do not make the cut...the ones that have jobs and excel start in high school and demonstrate a lot of talent in the mathematics and computer science realm.

I am teaching b/c I LOVE to teach.  I love to be in the classroom every day with students.  I spent 10 years in a successful IT career in which I made 4 times as much as I do now, but I couldn't be happier going back to get my masters and teaching mathematics every day!"
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, I have to say...


Heeheehee. ""TIT"""
highschoolteachers,"Hi!! I am a high school math teacher with self harm scars. When i interview I wear longer sleeves, not because of my scars but because i think its just more professional. I decided a long time ago that I will NOT get rid of my scars. That I will not hide them when I teach (I'm wearing no sleeves today actually, its 80!).  

In my opinion, it is SO important for kids to see them. You never know who needs to. I have had one student confront me about them and I was able to have the ""you can get through this, it *does* get better with time and help and effort"" conversation. Can you imagine if you had the opportunity when you were a student? I can. It would have been life changing, dont you think?? &lt;3 

So proud of you for getting this far. "
highschoolteachers,"I am going to be honest with you. When I tell people I am a teacher, I almost always get some sort of pseudo-sympathy-but-not-really response, which is due to people in my state not valuing teachers. But when I elaborate and explain I teach high school science, specifically chemistry-physics-astronomy, their tone changes and it becomes actually respectful. Different areas have different views of teachers, but if you are a woman or teach elementary school you get viewed differently than if you are a high school math or science teacher. As a teacher, we know it is all the same, all pieces are all essential to make up the full gamut of a child's education, but the outside world doesn't have the same view. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a kid who handed in someone else's work. I knew it was someone else's because he scratched out her name with a pencil and wrote his. 

This was a high school junior. "
highschoolteachers,"For me, it's all been about preference. 

I've climbed from 5th down through 1st. Now i'm getting my single subject in Math to teach high school. I didn't feel any more or less professional. Each grade is important.  

However, there's a bad reputation that lower grades means an easier job. That's not the case at all. Every person has strengths and weaknesses. Kinder may be easy for some, but a nightmare for others. "
highschoolteachers,"Nope. As a high school teacher I could not teach middle school.  I don't think any teacher worth anything openly believes this.  Parents and people not in the education world, though... probably.  Because they don't get it.  They think everything up until like 5th grade is all coloring and rainbows and recess."
highschoolteachers,"I am teaching full time, I coach basketball at the middle school and high school (3+ hours every night after school from October until the end of the year) and am taking grad school classes + gifted and talented classes (additional graduate level courses). I am taking them online through Ball State, supposed to be one of the best online graduate programs. 

I honestly don't view it as that difficult. It takes up roughly 2 hours on the weekend to get my assignments and readings done. You should have no trouble balancing graduate school without a full time job."
highschoolteachers,"They shouldn't but they probably do. Both present challenges, but in different ways. A high school teacher might plan for two sections of a class, but an elementary teacher plans for the entire day, every subject. As an elementary music teacher I plan 6 lessons that I teach all to 5 different sets of kids, all week long. My middle school counterparts teach the  same kids, but there's more continuity in day or day lessons. Both have challenges and pros and cons. "
highschoolteachers,"Asian parents do..

""When are you going to teach high school so you can make more money?""

Otherwise, I haven't met many people that see the different grades as promotions or demotions.  They just think I'm insane for teaching middle school."
highschoolteachers,"""as for parabolas, well, grenades travel on them. And no you dont need to understand them in order to throw one, but there is still relevance.""

Oh brother, that is a stretch if I ever saw one. Good grammar and punctuation have relevance in everyday life too, but people still manage to communicate effectively even without putting the appropriate apostrophe in conjunctions, or without capitalizing the first letter of every sentence, so why do we bother teaching those things? 

Continuity can only truly exist of grades and GPAs are completely eliminated, and we convert to a pass fail system. That is the only sure way to guarantee that when a student has completed a course, they have fully mastered every applicable concept within that relative course.

Educational institutions realize that the concept of continuity is impractical because, like I said earlier, students are 3-dimensional beings, and are not all equivalent. A room full of students in the same room, hearing the same lecture, given the same materials, and the same amount of time to complete assignments, will yield wildly differing outputs, regardless of the common inputs. That's why education institutions use what's called overlapping curriculum. Which is to say, that the last few chapters of Pre-Algebra are re-taught in the first year of Algebra 1, and the last few chapters of Algebra 1 are taught in the first year of Geometry (generally speaking) and the last few chapters of Geometry are taught in the first year of Algebra II. And ultimately, that is probably why the last two years of high school are often taught in the first two years of college. 

I'm still having a really good laugh about your grenade comment. Thanks for the conversation."
highschoolteachers,"I used to. 

Before I started teaching 8th grade, I thought of middle school as kind of like ""minor league"" for high school teachers. I'm not really sure where the perception came from, but in my college courses (my major was secondary Ed/ English) we definitely focused on teaching high school. None of us wanted middle school.

Now I realize that it's a different kind of challenge that requires a different kind of teacher. In my experience (3 years of high school teaching, 2 alternative Ed, 4 middle school), high school is more about content knowledge and middle school is classroom management. "
highschoolteachers,"Yup. I was talking to his case manager the other day and they said something along the lines of ""it's always interesting to see how students like these do in high school."""
highschoolteachers,"Dear yael24,

You sound like you really care and I applaud you for that. It matters that you care.

I teach high school, so I cannot give you advice about how to deal with second-graders.

I do know that you should document, document, document your efforts to address this situation (email is great for that) and that you should not do anything impulsive like confront or accuse a student unless you are certain you have the culprit. 

Be a pro. Don't let your behavior become the issue.

Emotional students and frustrated parents can become irrational and angry and decide to make you the bad guy (gal?) and even the most supportive administrator may throw you under the bus. It happens all the time. 

Sorry if that is not the kind of help you are looking for.

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"What level is this?  Elementary, middle or high school?  I'm at the high school level and honestly, I don't bother too much with cutesy stuff like that.  

I tell my students that *unless they are specifically instructed to use English* for a certain activity, they should always assume I want them to use French.  That goes for things like asking for a pencil, hall pass and so forth.  We go over how to say those things at the beginning of the year, and there are posters reminding them if they forget.  "
highschoolteachers,"I did my student teaching at summer school with blocks that were 2 1/2 hours. There was me, another student teacher from my program, the mentor teacher, and the biggest class was four high school kids, all on various levels. Two had 1st semester US history, one had 2nd semester US history, and one had geography. The mentor teacher just sort of chilled, and me and the other student teacher sort of took over, despite having no real clue what we were doing (we are both alt certified and had a grand total of 2 weeks of training before student teaching). It was a blast. I took the two 1st semester US history kids. 

I showed them a powerpoint with stories and videos to cover the chapter we were covering for the day right off. They did a worksheet or two that the mentor teacher required. Then we did content specific writing exercises, vocabulary crossword puzzles, and laid-back discussions. The block culminated with all of us getting back into a group and playing hangman using terms and concepts they had learned that day. When it was guessed, or the man was hung, they had to explain the word or event to the class. They loved it. One kid was wicked good at it. He drew a piece of candy and a surprisingly detailed map of France with a star over Paris. It was the Treaty of Paris.


And then I got to real school and had 32 kids in a classroom with just me and was like ""Shiiiiiiiiii..."""
highschoolteachers,"Wow! I'm a high school student, and at my high school, we actually have a school-wide program for this! Sudents can become a ""student"" teacher and co-teach with a teacher in whose class they've done well in. It's a year long commitment that takes up one class period (counts as elective credit). Training is also provided to learn some basic teaching skills. In fact, I signed up to do this next year for my Chemistry teacher,  instead of taking a third year of foreign language. Super excited but nervous! 

Perhaps you could expand this into a school wide thing and get more students involved?"
highschoolteachers,"Classroom management is built on 3 areas: 1) structures/processes that work, 2) rapport, 3) instructional design that allows for 1 and 2 to do their job. The order of importance is the order I have them listed in, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most administrators I've worked with. Rapport matters, but what's crucial is a structure and process that works for the class. 

In elementary and high school, I'd say the same things matter but would re-order the importance, putting instructional design at the top for HS, with rapport again 2nd, and structure last, whereas I'd put rapport first in Elementary with structure 2nd and instructional again last (in a high-needs environment, HS needs look like MS needs though, like at the roughest of Title 1 HS, you get the downsides of MS and HS in one challenging ball). All 3 are very important at all grade levels, though. 

It sounds to me like what you need to be working on is structure and processes, as well as instructional design in general (and as it relates to management). Don't rely on your focus in the moment or the teachable moment as much in the day-to-day; build a cohesive structure. What do you want to see during bellwork? What do you want to see during lecture/whole group? What do you want to see during independent work? Group work? Workshop? How do kids ask questions? How should they answer? How do they get materials? Everything should be really planned and thought-through. It sounds as though you lack organization in terms of both management and planning. 

No one is ever 100% sure where all their 7th graders are on the scale of progression (for one thing, they can revert backwards or jump upwards almost instantaneously at that age) and if they say they are, they're either measuring it very broadly or lying. What's more crucial is to be able to tell the kids where their work in X moment puts them and how to improve. "
highschoolteachers,"The world, unfortunately, is not as black and white as you would like it to be. A grade, particularly in public education, is more than simple content knowledge. It is a culmination of so many things that each teacher deems to be important for integration into the real world. I try to teach my kids to be lifelong learners, but not career students if that makes sense. 

I once stood on the same side of the argument that you are on right now. How can a student pass the class at all when they have such low proficiency in the subject? It just seems so crooked...

Well, then I taught high school for five years. More specifically, I taught remedial education for 5 years in high school. I can't speak for why colleges are offering more remedial courses. Could it be possible that they are trying to appeal to a broader student population consisting of older students who never completed high school and are trying to regain an education for themselves? It seems like you simply justify this query of yours with an unprecedented assumption that it's because high school teachers are slacking. 

My first managerial job in college was in pizza delivery. When I first started hiring, I asked my regional manager how to sift through the hundreds of applications we got every week. His response was "" make two stacks, one stack is applicants who did finish high school, and the other stack is simply ones who didn't"" 

The ""one's who didn't"" was usually a much bigger stack, and it automatically went in the garbage. I asked my manager if this was too harsh, because honestly, how much education do you really need to deliver pizzas? His response was that it's not about the academics, in his mind, it was more about which kids were able to follow rules and complete a program. 

Diplomas are so much more than just ""the next step to college."" Colleges even know that, that's why most accredited colleges even have their own entrance exams to assess proficiency, otherwise anyone with a diploma would automatically be granted admission. So, with all due respect, step off of your high horse. 

Could you pass the GED? Apparently, only 60% of high school grads and about 10% of grown adults over 30 can pass it as compared to previous years. Shouldn't this be a testament to the worthlessness of the majority of things that are taught in high school and how they apply to the real world? Nevertheless, you can't even stock shelves at Wal-Mart without a diploma or GED equivalent. So once again, come off of it and stop giving teachers a hard time.

"
highschoolteachers,"I once applied for a job at my old high school. I didn't hear back from them for a few months and when I finally did, my rejection letter had a glaring typo in it. I was very irritated by that."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I'm a little bit freaked out. I teach secondary English and there are so. many. of. us. The good thing is that the area has more opportunities, but I'm terrified I'm not going to find something. I've taught two years in high school, a year off, and this past year in middle school. I've always gotten renewed but this will be the second (AND LAST!) relocation.

Aw, you'll find something! Are there so many of us? I hear that sometimes, but aside from when the downturn hit bad in 2008, I have never seen it be that hard. Way easier than Social Studies, Elementary, or Electives. Sure, it's not as easy as *Math* or *inclusion SPED* but a good ELA teacher is often sought-after too these days, I feel. I've moved a few times, and I've never had trouble finding a job in ELA, especially once I had some experience and good recommendations. Especially with shortages beginning to bubble up in a lot of states and areas; not all areas have shortages, but many areas seem to have jobs. If it's an area with opportunities already evident, you'll get a job no problem with your diverse experience. 

Granted, middle school ELA jobs are generally easier to find than high school ones and worse schools easier to find than better ones, of course, so a new district might mean a ""starter"" school and then moving within the district later. "
highschoolteachers,That is an effective ritual for high school teachers as well.  Just cracked open my second one for the evening...
highschoolteachers,"I teach junior high and high school social studies and I'm known for giving quite a bit of homework in class. I believe that homework should reinforce what has been learned to help the student remember and understand the content. Sometimes I assign short essays and other times I assign worksheets that focuses on the vocabulary. Most of the work can be done in my class, but if you miss a day, it tends to be a pain to get caught up. I taught one year where I hardly assigned homework and it turned into a disaster. I had no idea that students didn't understand the content, so they would bomb tests. Homework helps me tell where a student is sitting in my class and if they might need extra assistance. It also benefits the student academically: it can help boost a grade and reinforce what we've discussed in class. I don't think homework should be ""pointless"" but I do think it should be assigned appropriately. Outside of the academic benefit, it can be looked as a responsibility that prepares students for the real world. You will be assigned tasks throughout life with deadlines. If you don't complete the task by the assigned deadline, there can be consequences. An example is doing your taxes. If they aren't done correctly by a certain day, you may have to pay a fine. You'll have deadlines in your job and daily life, so it is our responsibility as teachers to help prepare students for such expectations. Homework is one way we can do this. "
highschoolteachers,"It's the same for high school teachers, we feel like everything is not relevant to us and all the behaviors drive us nuts. The team leaders (one step below deans of instruction), my self included, have pushed and pushed and gotten the trainings condensed so they take only two hours instead of an entire day. It is still so much to take in sometimes. I'd start talking to the dean of instruction (or other appropriate figure) and giving them constructive ideas to implement like cutting out all the nonsense. Be prepared to explain why with concrete information."
highschoolteachers,"If being in the pool means you'll likely get another job, sounds like administration did you a bit of a backwards favor. This was not a good fit, and it'll hopefully show up as budgetary reasons so no one will think ill of you and it will create no barrier to re-hire elsewhere. 

My school had a science teacher we excessed despite needing her position. She was a terrible fit for middle school, no classroom management (she's teaching AP Chinese and AP/Honors Chemistry next year at a super good high school, she'll be A-OK because she was strong in every other area and middle school classroom management is its own beast), etc. She had 2 years, and my Principal ""cut her for budget reasons"" -- I assume she meant it as a kindness. We have the same deal, with a special pool who gets priority, etc, so she got a job readily, and a much better one for her. The teacher was a little miffed she wasn't ""told the truth"" but it worked out much better for the teacher than if she was cut for performance reasons (though I agree the Principal could've told her the truth to her face and filed the paperwork any which way). "
highschoolteachers,"The actual curriculum? Eh, been worse, been better, all told probably not bad. Problem is when they're also the test creators and the test results are dropping pretty severely over prior, paper based assessments, there's an unspoken fear the only way to succeed on the test is to match their learning products to their test, creating their own market.

Now, you also have to consider the new tests are said to be more rigorous than previous, which is true to a point. But I've proctored their crap with multiple grades and the test leaves a lot to be desired user interface wise and how to intuitively place answers around the screen. Perhaps it's different with the middle school or high school versions though, can't speak to those. "
highschoolteachers,"I understand, although for me it wasn't until I was in charge of corporate training that I became aware that I could teach at all. Then I began shyly giving piano lessons. When my studio became delightfully successful, I began teaching high school and I adore it. So possibly, there are several ways. 

But I truly appreciate your point...if your heart is not all in, the frustration will drive you away rapidly. "
highschoolteachers,"My certification is in Elementary Education K-6. I also double minored in TESOL K-12 and Japanese. I enjoy young children and their open mindedness. My students loved learning about Malala and I love blowing my students minds each day with things like Lies My Teacher Told Me or with news articles about kids their age who are making scientific discoveries. My students loved what we were learning about and when I told them I had to stop teaching the way I was teaching, several students asked if they could either go downstairs to talk with the principal or write letters complaining about the fact that they have to drop everything we are doing. I don't like departmentalization as it limits project based and authentic learning. And I don't want to deal with helicopter parenting that will go along with middle school and high school parents worrying about their students grades affecting entrance into college. I want to prove that even if younger kids are limited by stages of development, they are still far more capable than they are perceived by society. Honestly, I get along with children better than most adults because of their willingness to change and their open-mindedness. I butt heads with administration because of their lack of open-mindedness and unwillingness to change even with strong evidence to support ideas contrary to theirs."
highschoolteachers,"Teachers don't ""give"" grades to students, students earn their grade based on their work.  Teachers are here to help them and tally up the points.  If they just refused to cooperate and pull their weight when they had plenty of chances to do so, that's NOT on you.  Like you, I used to feel guilty about giving students failing grades.  However, it's actually extremely difficult to fail a high school class. It's been said that getting an F is just as difficult as getting an A since students have to purposely refuse to do work the majority of the time."
highschoolteachers,"I don't know. I teach high school. I still don't raise my voice even to high school students because I find it very unprofessional. The only time I raise my voice is when I'm trying to get class attention for a quick moment.

I'd assume that in kindergarten there would be consequences already put in place. When I was in kindergarten you lost opportunities. You couldn't color. You couldn't participate in some activities. You had to move to time-out.

As long as you are fair, consistent and firm [but not mean or overbearing] then you should be okay. Many parents [read: not all] are understanding and will really try to work with you especially if you lay out exactly what consequences you carry out.

In high school I tell them outright: I gave them a warning for &lt;whatever&gt;. They continued the behavior so they received a detention. Behavior continued (this can be the course of a week) so now I'm calling you and letting you know they have detention with administrators. The next step is a referral and I wanted to ask you what you might recommend.

Sometimes parents won't care. Sometimes parents never answer their phone. Sometimes parents get belligerent so I immediately refer to administration. However, they really are the minority. Even though it seems like they are every single parent out there...

Edit: Also, kudos if that's what you want to do. Guys are few and far between in this profession and especially at that level. Or at least it seems that way. I swear I'm surrounded by women all day."
highschoolteachers,"The lows are devastatingly low, the highs are mindblowingly high.  You will have both, sometimes in the same day, with a lot of relentless grind and frustration in between.

Teaching is like playing whack-a-mole for 8 hours a day.  You are always thinking about fifteen different things, readjusting, solving problems, putting out fires, correcting, reteaching, making big and small decisions.  It is mentally exhausting.  

Teaching is not like working in most other settings.  You don't get to just quick run to the store, or meet up with a friend for a longer lunch, or even pull out your phone to quickly talk to the plumber whose services you need at your house.  You can do those things during your prep, if you're not meeting with a student or doing a thousand other things.  You can only run to the bathroom if someone else can watch your class, and in some schools you can't even leave campus without telling the office or getting permission.

You are always being watched.  Everything you do, say, the way you do your hair, the fact that you wore two blue shirts last weekend, the cut you got from shaving, the joke you wanted to laugh at but think you caught yourself - they saw the twitch.  Kids are very into the minutiae.  They will notice, they will talk about you, they will tell stories about you to their friends and families.  Some of those stories will even be true.

The community at large will form certain expectations, assumptions, and ideals for you based on your profession.  They will project their own hopes, fears, disappointments, successes, and concerns onto you, whether or not you have any face-to-face interaction with them whatsoever.

If you are dealing with high school students, you will usually find that they get to take credit for their successes, but their failures are all on you.  The parents will remind you, lest you forget.

If you are teaching English, you will not be Robin Williams in DPS more than two or three times a year many years (although some years you will be from day one, and you will feel like a god/dess).  You will not primarily spend your time discussing great literature and holding life-changing discussions.  Prepare to love the re-re-re-re-re-re-reteaching of how to write a proper paragraph, you'll be doing that sort of thing more often.

You will drown in a sea of papers that need to be graded, and your eyes will glaze over when you read about the topic du jour for the 52nd time.  

You will stand in front of a room full of eyes and have absolutely no idea what to do with them.  You will close the door after a long day, sink into your chair, and then realize you have no idea what you're doing the next day.

You will have friends and family that get very upset about the fact that you're not going out with them, that you're ready for bed by 8 p.m., that you skip events because you need to grade or plan or go to conferences.  Or because you just.won't.stop.talking.about.the.kids.  (We all do it.)

You will feel a rush to the depths of your soul when you run into a parent at Target and she tells you how much her daughter loves your class.  You will want to burst with pride when ultra-tough-no-one-messes-with-me football player tells you that his teammates would laugh, but he actually enjoyed the poetry the most.  You will celebrate with students who got into their dream college or got a 4 on the AP test or got a C- instead of the usual D+ on a test.  You will wake up in the middle of the night or stop on the middle of a long run because you were just inspired by the coolest idea that you know 3rd period will love.  You will laugh because teenagers say the weirdest, most insightful shit.

If teaching is right for you, I can't say.  It's all of those things (but thank God not all at the same time).  

My goodness, I do love my job and those kids.

edit: i grammered bad.

edit2: thank you, mysterious gilder.  what an unexpectedly nice way to end an outstanding year of school!"
highschoolteachers,"I didn't right away. I got a job at a famously terrible high school and hated it, but got used to it by the end of the year and was ready to return in September. That was until my old principal from the school I interned at the previous year called. Its a totally different setting from what I student taught (student taught a top 25 in the nation trig course, I currently teach a middle school 12:2:2 for kids with severe emotional disabilities. It's 1,000,000 times better than my first job and this year has been amazing. Couldn't be happier career wise. "
highschoolteachers,"I refuse to do the ""clap if you can hear me"" bullshit.

I generally will not participate in any of the stupid shit you listed. I didn't do it in high school, so I sure as shit am not going to do it as an adult."
highschoolteachers,I mean that's great for 5th grade and I've done similar activities as an opener in middle. But it's not appropriate rigor except maybe as a hook/modeling activity at the high school level. It's not going to be a major topic covered in English and shouldn't be. Awesome for elementary kind of proves that. 
highschoolteachers,"Have you tried videoing some of your class periods and watching it to see what went wrong?

I'm currently an instructional coach and this is really one of the best practices I can recommend. It allows you to see things that you wouldn't normally see or be aware of. I can come into your classroom every day and observe and TELL you what I see- but seeing it yourself is so much more powerful. It really allows YOU to hone in on those mistakes and/or missed opportunities and formulate a plan of attack.

Take heart, classroom management is something EVERY new teacher struggles with. It's a delicate balance and to some extent, does come with experience. 

I wish I could tell you there was a magic fix or a fail-proof behavior system. Not the case. NO TWO GROUPS are the same- a behavior management system or strategy that works beautifully with one group can fail miserably with another. 

Recognizing when what you're doing isn't working and taking steps to correct it is important, but often easier said than done. Some teachers make the mistake of thinking that they have to stick hard and fast with the rules they set on day 1- even if those are failing miserably. Don't be afraid to make adjustments when things aren't working.

Have you tried talking with the kids and getting their input on what kind of classroom environment they'd like to have, and what rules they would consider important? Often kids will feel like they have more buy-in if they've taken part in the process, rather than being handed an arbitrary set of rules by the teacher. 

My first year teaching, I was working with middle school (6,7,8th here in the US). I'm an ESL teacher, and was also their RELA teacher. Behavior management with my 8th grade intermediate ELLs was my biggest struggle. Many days I'd collapse on my couch in tears at the end of the day. Over the winter break, I resolved that I WOULD fix this. What I was doing wasn't working- I knew it, and so did the kids. Over the break I read up on a lot of different strategies and philosophies and systems- even reading into the psychology of it all too. 

I returned to the classroom, acted like it was day 1 all over again, and put my plan into action. We still had some bumps- but they were few and far between, and we made changes and adjustments as necessary. Pretty soon, the teacher that ran in-school suspension would bring me kids when his room was too full or he had to be out and didn't have a sub. The year that began with the kids making me cry ended with me crying to see them go on to high school. 

You can turn these classes around, but it will take work. You can do it!"
highschoolteachers,"Right! Most high schools have a web page with links to their school newspaper. Facebook pages. Twitter. Instagram. I would work into the interview that you read a year's worth of school news, checked out their Facebook, etc. Going in blind is foolish unless you're in one of the top three: Special Ed, Math, or Science."
highschoolteachers,"I spent around 1000. But I am a high school science teacher who was provided nothing. No lab supplies, no cleaning supplies, no art supplies (markers, lined paper, cardstock, paint), no supplies for required labs (they told me to buy the 100 dollars of fish &amp; squid dissection out of my own pocket). I hit 1k easy, preparing and filling my classroom. Everything costs money, from hand soap, to pens, to oven mittens, to hot glue sticks."
highschoolteachers,For middle or high school 150 is a good ball park. Let's you buy needed class supplies your school might not provide as well as organizational materials to make your life easier. Plus some decoration to make an empty room less stark.
highschoolteachers,"I love looping with my kids in high school (where it's more common you'll teach kids more than once).  I've got seniors I taught for three years and I love them and we have a great relationship.

However from my first year to my second I taught the same things.  From my second to my third I taught the same thing.  And THEN I started changing grades and looping.

I highly recommend looping... starting in year 4.  Not in year 1.  You barely had your head above water this year, I'd assume, like most teachers.  Give yourself another year or two to get settled in third grade."
highschoolteachers,"Mostly yes, but in my personal opinion is a culmination of their level of proficiency in things like classroom behavior, punctuality, responsibility, as well as the course content knowledge (at the high school level at least). For stepwise subjects like math, I generally have the option to give the kid a passing grade (so that they get the necessary credit to graduate) but recommend to their guidance counselor that they repeat the course again next year rather than move up to the next math. 

I honestly have some kids in my classes that genuinely give it their best but simply cannot gain satisfactory mastery of the subject knowledge. These kids are usually the exception, rather than the rule, but when I do come across these kids that genuinely try their hardest yet simply can't apply this or that concept, my justification is as follows:

Is it right for me to setback the life-altering accolade of a diploma for this hard-working and honest student, simply because they cannot master a subject that has such limited practical use in the majority of mainstream jobs on the market today? (a.k.a. Algebra)

It should be noted that without mastery of the content, the ""passing"" grade I assign for these types of students is usually a D. But these students are 3-dimensional individuals, and often times their hopes and dreams hang on your discretion as a teacher, and several factors must be taken into account when assigning grades, including what ultimate effect a failure in that class will have on the student, and whether or not they truly deserve that ultimate consequence. "
highschoolteachers,"What worked for me, and was subtle, was making a website portfolio/resume. With my submitted formal resume (boring list type resume) I put the link to my website at the top with my address and contact information. I also linked it again on the summary portion on my LinkedIn account, which every admin looks up because they want to make sure your internet trail is clean before interviewing you. It set me apart as a first year teacher, gave me a space to put pictures/sample work/hobbies that make me look ""wholesome""(which was important because I'm 23 and look like I'm high school aged, and am teaching high school), and showed that I am fluent in using modern technology. The principal told me during my interview that he looked at my LinkedIn and website. I applied for the job on a Wednesday, called in for an interview on Thursday, and was offered the job on Monday. Definitely was effective. "
highschoolteachers,"I think it was within the last month that the high school next door to the middle school I work at had a bomb threat posted on social media that someone was going to try to bomb the library that the two schools share that sits right in between the high school and the middle school. They closed down the library, had cops and bomb dogs out, and emailed all the teachers to say ""the library is closed today, we will give you more information later.""

At the end of the day, they sent out an email explaining what had happened and that everything was fine. It was basically  just another day except when you walked around part of the campus, you could see police cars with flashing lights in front of the library."
highschoolteachers,"That's what a certificate of attendance is. It essentially says that this kid come to school and sat in chairs for four years, but didn't successfully meet the academic requirements to earn a diploma. The problem with that is the certificate is worth about as much as the paper it's printed on, and without a high school diploma, job options are severely limited.

What *should* happen is colleges should stop accepting people with 1.0 (or less) GPAs and actually hold kids to an academic standard. Colleges/universities need/want money, student loans are insanely easy to obtain, schools don't have to worry about chasing down unpaid debt, and kids are programmed that their only path to success is college. Then, after they fail out freshman year, they owe thousands of dollars for an education they didn't get. 

And I completely agree that students who don't know the difference between ""are"" and ""our"" is, to say the least, frustrating. I'm blaming curriculum designers for that shit. Teachers aren't supposed/allowed to teach grammar in isolation anymore (unless the kids are taking a state test on it), and papers are graded on ideas, not mechanics. Kids are supposed to pick up on proper grammar and mechanics through reading. Clearly, that's worked. /s

Needless to say, my first project is about commonly misused words. I don't teach it. I have the kids teach each other and I give feedback. So, technically, I'm following the (asinine and created to make kids dumber) rules.

(Btw, if I sound bitter, I'm not. Well, maybe a little. Overall, I love what I do and even on days (last two months of the school year) I want to find a new career, I can't picture myself doing anything else. More than anything, I want my kids to be successful after they leave my classroom, but I feel like the deck has been stacked against so many of them that my efforts are just a fart in the wind. But I'll be dammed if they misuse are, our, and hour! 😜)"
highschoolteachers,"I only have like one other student in the class that intentionally behaves the way he does. Everyone else will for the most part, listen to what I ask for at least 5 minutes before getting distracted and forgetting what they are supposed to be doing. They are an extremely talkative bunch, but only this student and one other will do things like refuse to sit down after getting up without permission, actively ignoring me when I give them a direction, give me major attitude when I point out that there will be consequences if they continue to not follow directions, etc.

I've tried the whole ""thank you for your good behavior today"" thing, but it happens so little that it never seemed to make an impression.

Grades are due for this class on Friday and next week is all about ""celebrate that you are graduating and going to high school next year!"" so supposedly I'm not going to have too many of them around to deal with. But of course, the ones you want to be absent are the ones that never are. So we'll see what happens.... I just have to make it until the 26th. It feels like an eternity away, though."
highschoolteachers,"If a kid works his ass off and just can't pass the tests/meet the guidelines for projects, I coordinate with the EC teacher (thus far these kids have had IEPs as well), I'll modify the rubric so that the kid ""earns"" a passing grade. These kids aren't going on to college or anywhere really where their GPA matters. I want to encourage their work ethic in the hopes that it will stay with them as they move on to a job--a job they need a high school diploma to get.

However, I make it clear to students on the first day that I don't pass or fail a single one of them. I merely record the effort/applied knowledge demonstrated on their work. If they pass, it's because they took the material and did something with it. If they met the basic requirements, they earn a C. If they exceed basic requirements, they earn a B or A. If they fail, it's because they chose to fail. I didn't fail them. 
Rant over. I just hate the wording of ""I failed a student."" Fuck that. I did my damn job and worked my ass of trying to reach every kid. 
End of the year...lots of tears, begging, angry protestations, etc. Want to graduate? Do. The. Damn. Work. 
Rant really over. "
highschoolteachers,"Stations. Get them moving. Can you get a bunch of white sheets (or sheets, screw the color) for dirt cheap from a thrift store and have them reenact stuff from the Odyssey? Make crowns/shields or something from paper? Create a Jeopardy game for review and have one kid in charge of deciding which team gets to answer the question and another in charge of keeping track of the score? Are you doing the Odyssey until the end? If not, kids seem to freaking love poetry (if they initially say no, ask if they like RAP music. If they say yes to that, let them know RAP is an acronym for Rhythm And Poetry.) Let them create a poetry book with the different kinds of poems and let them design the pages. 
If you need any resources, let me know.  English teacher for 10+ years and have taught 9-12. Don't mind sharing anything. (FYI...I am all about projects) 
Good luck. This time of year, high school kids on,y care about the two Fs. One is fighting. I'll let you figure out the other. 😉😶"
highschoolteachers,"The admins request we change our grading system entirely, all for this one student. This student has consistently failed all classes across the board and is starting to bully his peers. Students have filed bullying reports, student has been put on an IEP and numerous conferences have happened. It doesn't make a single difference. He's marching on to high school unscathed. It's really remarkable. "
highschoolteachers,"I've taught with a projector on a whiteboard and a smart board. It depends on the smartboard. I would look at a short throw smart board, they are the most accurate with writing and calibrating in my opinion. I would be totally lost without my smartboard. I use it every single day in all of my classes. I download templates for review games also that are interactive with my high school students. I can't imagine a room without one. I've been spoiled."
highschoolteachers,"I'm going to respectfully disagree. Wong's book is very old school and is more tailored towards elementary. 

I'd suggest *Lost at School: Why Our Kids with Behavioral Challenges are Falling Through the Cracks and How We Can Help Them* by Ross Greene. It's a much different philosophy than Wong's, one that I think lends itself more towards middle/high school (which is what the OP is teaching) and more towards ""problem"" students, who will be causing OP to tear out his/her hair in frustration. Greene addresses this, while Wong does not."
highschoolteachers,I love number 5. It makes such a difference when you don't collect everything. I'm going into my 5th year teaching high school social studies and I just started doing this last year. I used to feel guilty if I didn't collect everything but now I realize I should spend my time giving quality feedback on specially selected assessments rather than taking home mountains of small homework and classwork assignments.
highschoolteachers,"What sorts of readings have you offered that are contemporary?  It can be very hard to encourage kids to learn who have absolutely no motivation to do the work.  I see this every day at my high school and it is sad.  The worst thing is that many of these students were  simply passed from grade to grade.  Teachers are pressured to move students along to make room for the next class, even though the students do not have the skills to be successful at the next level yet.  I think this is a very real problem especially in the poor, urban, minority schools across the nation.  I am not really sure what to do but passing these students along only lets future classes know that they do not really have to do anything and they will be passed, just as it has always happened.  If it were me I would try to get them interested in what artists like Kendrick Lamar, Tupac, Lupe Fiasco, and others write about in their songs.  These artists talk a lot about social issues that are affecting the urban minorities and encourage people to learn about themselves and people.  Many of the students I work with really like this kind of music, but they often miss the point or do not actually understand what the writer is trying to point out or say.

edit:  I know this Freedom Writers is kind of cliche, but I still always get the chills from watching it.  Maybe try showing it at the beginning of the year and talk about what the students think."
highschoolteachers,"I'm in college too, about to start my student teaching this semester, and I'm planning on a shirt and tie/bow tie everyday for two reasons. The first is to look professional and the second is that if I don't, I could be confused for a high school student."
highschoolteachers,"Same thing for us. I student taught in PA, at the high school I attended, my co-op was my former teacher. She was out one day and I had a sub in my room. They just sat in the back while I taught. 

I would talk to your school's student teacher coordinator. That just doesn't sound right to me."
highschoolteachers,"As for #1 - yes. I know it may come off wrong, but if I don't get something done by 4 pm, then I'll take care of it tomorrow. The third year in the classroom really checked me and made me realize that I needed to simply say ""no"" to taking work home. Does this mean I never take work home? No. It just means that if I can avoid coming home with any work, I do that.

My high school English teacher, with whom I owe a lot to, drilled this into me during my 2nd year - you need to make time for yourself--for you--otherwise, you'll burn out and end up leaving the profession for good.

So yes, folks, subscribe to a ""get things done"" system if you have to to organize yourself. But do as much as you can while you're at school to minimize the work you take home.

I know this is going to be a challenge for me this year as I'll be the case manager for a few dozen students with IEPs. But I believe that if I'm organized and efficient enough during my 8-3 shift, then I can get everything done then."
highschoolteachers,"Very nice. I'm going into my fourth year as a teacher, but moving up to high school level, and it's like having to start all over, especially with navigating and just going with the flow. I'm usually not someone who will bad mouth anyone (I hate drama), but I still have to be extra careful with my words and simply how I conduct myself.

Also, plus one on the getting involved with the school community part. Yes, attending the baseball games may make a difference in terms of how serious a borderline kid will take your class. I've seen it firsthand and will try to be as involved as possible."
highschoolteachers,"I use a cloze method, where students fill in specific blanks while the bulk of the information is already printed for them. It works well for English language learners and students with special needs, and to be honest, all of the other students enjoy the simplicity of it.  

It may sound a bit like spoon-feeding them, but in the end, they have ALL of the information you wanted to convey.  Especially at the high school level, students have trouble discerning what is important or necessary to copy down. If you gave them something in a whole sentence, they write the entire thing, no matter how many times you say not to.  If you highlighted the main idea / important words in the sentence, then deleted them from your original note set, and gave kids the version with the blanks... that's basically the cloze method.  It also makes it acceptable for students to share notes with one another (think: if a kid is absent, how does s/he make up the day's work?).  When you ask students to take their own notes, it seems unethical to have them share (a form of plagiarism), but with cloze notes, the information was given exactly like that to the class as a whole and kids can feel free to borrow/share notes and help one another after absences or while studying. "
highschoolteachers,"At the start of each chapter, I write all the notes students need to know on the white board. I do block scheduling, so it usually takes at least 2-3 block periods to go over all of the notes--meaning I only have to write notes once every week or so. When I'm done, I take a picture with my phone so that I can write them faster next semester/year.

Once the students come in, I let them take notes how they like. Some meticulously copy down every word, others just listen to me and take notes based on what I say. Some do both.

The majority, however, just sit and listen. When class is over, they walk up and take a picture with their phones. This method allows those students to engage and participate fully in my instruction, rather than splitting their attention between writing and listening. I've found a lot of students, especially those with ADD/ADHD, do much better on assessments using this method. They remember what we talked about because they were engaged, and they study the picture on their phone for the assessment.

I tell my students to use whichever note-taking technique works best for them, and to adapt as the year progresses if they aren't happy with their first few assessment scores. I believe this method prepares them for the freedom of college note-taking and provides some ownership over their learning. That key factor (ownership) is why I don't just print the notes out for them. They have to make a choice.

It's worked wonderfully the last two years, and I plan to continue. I teach high school drama/oral communication, BTW, but I think anyone can use this method. Lots of note-taking methods focus way too much on CREATING STUDY MATERIALS, rather than engaging the students with the material as they learn it."
highschoolteachers,"I work in a 6:1:1 alternative high school and I absolutely love it. My most helpful bit of advice is probably something you are already aware of. Make your relationships your first priority. Call parents, be a part of your students lives, know them, let them know (some of) you. It is the best investment you can make towards their learning."
highschoolteachers,"I'm on board with all of it except #2.

Teaching responsibility is important; if the teacher is constantly picking up students' proverbial socks, then how do they learn any? Set your expectations (reasonable ones), indicate and demonstrate that you expect students to be working, but if a given student is consistently off-task or disengaged - and it isn't for the reasons of a personal issue in their life or a learning disability - then I really do think that they need to learn to deal with the consequences, and yes, that means making it perfectly clear to a student that they are free to do nothing and will reap the consequences of that choice. It really is a valuable life lesson, and I've seen it turn around many students who were more accustomed to simply having teachers, admin, and parents cover for them. This is not the same as advocating the idea of not trying to engage the student, but if they refuse, then there are 30-ish other students who are in more need of one`s time.

I teach only at the high school level. If you're always chasing students to put X away, or to stop doing Y, they will expect that to be the norm, and you will often have to do so - if not frequently, especially in more difficult schools. 

The rest of the advice is very good indeed. As a new(er) teacher, #1 really strikes me as the best. I was (and still am) concerned over having 'great' lessons, but reality is that as a newer teacher, you just don't have the resources nor expertise of someone who has taught a given subject/grade for many years. I honestly wish there were 'pre-made' unit/lesson plans for new teachers when they are given their first assignment - if they featured a good mix of tech integration, 'active' lessons, and useful tips, think of how much faster teachers would improve their craft, and how many fewer burnouts we'd have."
highschoolteachers,"I am a huge believer if it ain't broke don't fix it, just model it and it's something they can use all the way through college. As a teacher you want to be on the cutting edge, but understanding how and why to take notes will always be an essential skill for success, notes will be around for for middle school, high school and in college. Professors do not give a shit on new trends in education, they are still teaching the same will and most likely will for years to come. If anything Cornell notes will get them ready for the 21st century. You just can't do them everyday or your children will murder you."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with John Dewey. 

The current refrain is to make kids college and career ready. To me this is the least desirable. Because it assumes that we haven't been. But it also sets intent - to perpetuate the current system. And how's that working for us peasants?

You could go with Jefferson who said education is to perpetuate democracy. Well that assumes democracy is the apex of human achievement. 

Dewey suggests education is for the child - for education sake. 

What does this practically mean?  First, we can't measure. Well, we can't place arbitrary measures of learning as we do now. 

I shouldn't have to force a thing. If you've observed your class, they seem to learn more from each other than us. Sure we set the subject, but they are fantastic at clarifying. We should just monitor and fill in gaps. We should also, just from our experience, set questions. Why is the U.S. so racially divided?

Lower grades are tricky, but that's why I see value in not breaking kids out by age. Mix kids with ability with other kids who are temporarily unable.  

By high school you need content experts. Chemistry should be - let's blow shit up. Let's melt stuff. Physics should be, let's build robots. Math should be engineering. Writing program, building circuits. 

I often let my kids go with a question. I have 3/4 of the class working which allows me to focus on the 1/4 and really antagonize them into answering the question. Yes antagonize. What? You don't think there is a racial divide?  You're Hispanic, you've never experienced something you'd consider racist?  So your solution is to sit there and do nothing? Be a victim?  Get angry, learn, defeat. "
highschoolteachers,Ha! I'm so immersed in Reddit and Pinterest that I didn't even think to just Google it. But I teach high school Spanish.  
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for giving me some resources to use. I currently have their IEPs from last year as well as their IEP progress reports.

I like to base my goals and objectives off of grade level standards. Unfortunately, and somewhat fortunately none of their goals are standards based but most have achieved mastery or adequate progress.

Also kind of off putting is that reading through the ETR data and looking at past OAA scores- the goals aren't necessarily based on that. For example: student scores below average in math fluency and computation but has no goal. Another student received a score near the mid 400s on their OAA (proficient is 400) and is average in reading on the WISC but has a reading comprehension goal.
Another has a spelling goal but no one teaches spelling in high school and they mastered their last goal.

 My plan was to get a baseline for ninth grade skills (what I listed in the actual post) and develop their objectives/benchmarks off their present levels. Does that make sense or am I a moron (seriously, after reading these IEPs and ETRs, someone is doing something not right...)"
highschoolteachers,"Same here. I found my students were able to focus a lot more. Most teachers wouldn't do this, either, saying it's disrespectful, but the key is managing it with respect on both sides. If you're respectful and have it put away while I'm actively teaching, then who am I to say you can't listen to music during work time? 

Students did put up a stink when I told them they had to take their tests without it. The (sound) logic given to me in high school was, ""I don't know what you've recorded on there and are listening to now - maybe you got hold of the test and have the answers."" The kids are always surprised when I tell them this, then angry I figured it out before they could -snicker-"
highschoolteachers,"Please please please define it as a concept of ratios.  PLEASE.  We're going to extend this into the idea of rational (ratio...RATIOnal)  numbers and closed number systems in high school...and you're going to make life hard for students when they have to comprehend the concept of dividing by fractions, etc.  Start reinforcing this as early as you can because number systems and extensions are so important in mathematics, so are ratios!
"
highschoolteachers,"I guess that depends on each individual teacher. I'm a special education teacher so I obsessively track data and I do see large differences in my students' progress from the beginning of the year to the end. This data not only includes academic goals but also social goals and life skills. I don't want to sound like I think I am god's gift to teaching (because I definitely am not) but I have had a handful of parents thank me for helping them better understand their child's disability and giving them tools to deal with their behaviors. Can I say that, decades later, I will have changed the course of their life? Of course not. Maybe for some, but definitely not for all. I am a small part of their entire school career. I do think that, if I just phoned it in and did the bare minimum, they would be worse off than they are now. That is enough for me. 

I see you teach secondary and I can tell you that the teachers that I remember from middle and high school as making a difference are the ones who challenged me to think of things from alternate world views and to form my own opinion on things that I probably wouldn't have cared about otherwise. I also remember the teachers who assured me that there was a bigger word outside of my high school and small home town. None of that can be measured by data but I can tell you that it made a gigantic difference for me. I also never thought to thank them for the difference they made.

Hard data is useful for a lot of things but it is a small portion of my personal self-worth as an educator. Honestly, if I didn't believe that what I did made a difference, I probably would pursue something else. "
highschoolteachers,"Depends. Generally, my admin responds to things in a very heavy-handed way, which I often find to be disrespectful of the students. Example: students made a mess in one teacher's classroom during lunch (unsupervised), admin banned food from all classrooms, even with teacher permission. I turn a blind eye to non-messy snacks, and students clean up their messes in my room. If they don't, they get to come in during lunch and clean.

I also sometimes pretend I don't see tardies if I know a student is coming from the other end of the school (we only have a 3-minute passing period). I also let students run to the bathroom if they need to as long add they check in with me before the tardy bell and come back within a couple minutes. 

I teach at a high school, for reference."
highschoolteachers,"I worked in an urban title 1 high school for a little over two years. We were all encouraged to use this this formula for addressing problems with students: You state the behavior (I noticed that you were shouting a lot today in class) ask them what was going on, and only after listening to their side, explain why it's not OK and discuss ways to change. 

I was surprised at how important it was to listen to the student's version of things. 

These are all answers I've gotten to ""I've noticed you were missing your homework for the last two weeks. What's going on?"": 

* My house just burned down my mom's in the hospital and my homework burned (kid was a class clown so no one believed him at first but story checked out). 
* The police were at my house last weekend because my sister's in a gang (from one of my top students, a very shy quiet girl). 
* My mom doesn't want me home except at night because my dad drinks too much. There's no where for me to do work. 
* My mom's best friend lost her home and has been staying with us so there's no where for me to be. 

Sometimes all you can do is listen. Some you can problem solve (would doing your homework after school help?)

edit: formatting"
highschoolteachers,I ordered it because of your post. As a long term teacher in a Title I school what you have written makes a lot of sense.  It has been my experience that teaching in these circumstances is all about relationships. I can't convince my students why high school is worth it if they do not trust me and see that I understand where they are coming from. Unfortunately there is little in the way of training for this for teachers which is why I think we have such a high turnover rate. I hope this book can be a resource for this. If so I will be making sure everyone at my site gets a copy. 
highschoolteachers,"1. Be honest and open about why you are there, so they understand and believe that you are invested, and won't abandon them.  In my own case, I had a lot of privilege that ""bought"" me several second chances in high school; although I learned to teach at private schools, ""burning off"" that privilege is much more satisfying, and it's going to take a lifetime.  I also have children who are currently younger than my students - so I have a personal stake in helping nurture a safe and successful world for THEM.   Telling them these things - sharing my own story, in other words - has been a useful tool to help students trust me, and the environment I create.

2. Find and use metaphors and images they can understand which help you build buy-in - ideally through creating a sense of civic responsibility, to school, classroom, and universe.  For example, I often point out to my students that their minds are a finite natural resource, like gasoline - something the world needs.  When they don't show up, or tune out, I can then point out that the reason I might seem a little frustrated is that they are engaged in the equivalent of going to a gas station and paying to pump gas directly onto the ground - an environmentally toxic thing, and a waste of resources.  When they succeed, I can say ""now we're cooking with gas!"", which is silly but rewarding.  

3. Many of these kids know, deeply, that they are behind the rest of their peer groups outside the inner city walls.  Be honest about their disadvantages - in the community, in their instability - and then show them how to ply those as strengths, and to build from there.  Clarify, early and often, that they are NOT stupid, just disadvantaged and inexperienced.  Point out that experience is what they are in the classroom to develop.  Make the classroom SEEM valuable to them, in other words.  Frame it well, from day 1.  

4. Be as consistent as possible, and work HARD to maintain it throughout their time with you.  These kids have less consistency in their world than any other cohort - they need to see it, and slowly grow to trust it, if you are to get anything at all out of them.  

5. Most importantly: love and know the whole student.  Practice respect and curiosity.  Use questions, not commands.  Never, ever, compete with them EXCEPT with humor.     

(Putting those last three together: I often say ""I get to model how to use a brain, though I'm not perfect, I've had a lot more experience.  So be careful - if you try to compete with me brain for brain, you will hardly ever win.  This is NOT about me being smarter - I may NOT be smarter.  I just have more experience with my own brain.  My JOB is to help you gain that experience...and to learn how to keep using it and gathering it, beyond and after this classroom experience ends"").  "
highschoolteachers,"I worked for 8 years in challenging schools in communities with lots of social challenges. Attendance rates were horrible. I planned my program such that kids just picked up where they left off when they were last there. A quick lesson, then time to pursue their chosen work, and a quick journal entry at the end of the class. I respond to all the journals each day asking questions, sharing experiences and observations. Nothing huge, just a few sentences. Gave them a private communication conduit to me which really helped build relationships. I was teaching high school English at the time so kiss had books on the go, and stories they were working on. If they had missed a class, or the previous week or month as sometimes happened, they picked up their folder with their work and just carried on, I'd welcome them back, glad to see you, how have you been? What book were you reading again? Oh yeah... You just got to that part where...

Nancy Attwell's book ""In the Middle"" was my saviour in those first few years of teaching.  "
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the recommendation. My wife worked in an elementary public school here in St. Louis for a year and the horror stories I heard terrified me. I've been working as a TA and middle school elective teacher at a character-driven charter and love it. But, I'm going to begin teaching high school English next year, more than likely for St. Louis Public Schools, so I am doing every thing I can to prepare myself for worst case scenario. This book will go a long way to help me center and prepare myself. Thanks again!"
highschoolteachers,"[This book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pedagogy-Real-Talk-Connecting/dp/1483377113)  is an incredible resource when it comes to working with some of the most difficult at-risk students. I've actually been fortunate to have the author as a professor and mentor throughout my career. He is a former at-risk student who was raised on the streets in LA and who was involved in gangs from when he was young. One day, he decided to turn his life around, and he ended up becoming a professor and educational activist, trying to give voices to students like he was. 

A lot of the theories revolve around ways to form relationships and open routes of communication with (typically high school aged) students who have classically shut teachers out. He emphasizes making sure the students understand the idea of passion, so they realize the school system is a tool to help them do the things they want in life, rather than an extra burden they don't need in top of finding enough to eat, or protecting siblings from an abusive relationship.  Sorry if I sound like an ad; the book only came out last month and I just started reading it yesterday, so I haven't gotten to the specific parts yet. "
highschoolteachers,"I worked in an urban middle school for 2 years. I had many emotional students. Instead of yelling or getting mad at students, I found it was better to make a joke and be sassy. It also helped to talk to the students about their behavior once they calmed down. 

A book all my students love was Forged by Fire. I believe the main character is in high school and it is about how he deals living with an abusive step dad. "
highschoolteachers,"I tutor privately every day after school. Mostly high school English and History, but I do have a couple of primary aged kids, and I've previously had adult students as well.

Rewards: 

-Seeing a kid learn to read, and sound out the words.  

-Seeing a student go from handing in no work and failing classes, to getting solid B grades. 

-And helping a man learn to read, the day he told me he read Robin Hood with his kids (who had all been reading above his level), I went home and cried happy tears.

Challenges: 

-Balancing my life during the term. I am a sub, so I can leave pretty much at day's end, but then I tutor for 2-3 hours and I'm exhausted.

-Dealing with the kids who hate school and don't want tutoring. I spend a lot of time making nice with these kids to get them on side. 

Overall though, I have a great time with my tutoring students. I will be very sad when we part ways at the end of the year."
highschoolteachers,"Do you have any hobbies? Enjoy any TV shows or movies? Books? 

...anything? 

Put up posters about the things you like (that are safe for school). It will remind students that you are a person, with interests outside of your job. 

I also tell my students I will hang any poster they donate, so long as it is school appropriate. 

I had a Harry Stiles poster in my room for most of last year as a consequence, so maybe not such a good idea. :p

PS: The posters I brought in myself include Serenity, The Oatmeal, stuff from xkcd and Surviving the World, Adventure Time, a number line that goes from -20 to 100, a list of all Common Core math standards for high school, and the names of certain complex 3D shapes. "
highschoolteachers,I really like the lottery thing? How is the scratch off part done? I think it's a cute idea for a high school incentive system.
highschoolteachers,"I work for Disney in child care. I go from teaching middle &amp; high school during the day to supervising younger children at night. I like both jobs for different reasons. I don't have to be emotionally invested in the kids at night, but it is fun to make magic for them and help make their vacations more exciting. I get to connect with them in a way that I don't with the kids at school, but of course it's a very short (a few hours at most) interaction. I like teaching middle &amp; high school though too, because I get to share my love of history and help them on their journey through adolescence!
"
highschoolteachers,"Little things my boyfriend did for me this past year (my first year teaching):

1. Let me vent - he took my side, listened, (hugged me and bought me jubejubes when it was ""that bad"") and offered outlandish and utterly ridiculous solutions that let me calm down and put the issue into perspective. 
2. Proofread my project/assignment outlines and pointed out the loopholes that he would have taken advantage of in high school. So. Useful.
3. Reminded me that not every lesson has to be the most brilliant piece of teaching that I've ever done - especially appreciated at 11:00 at night and the panic is setting in. 
4. Always asked about my day - asked how the lesson I'd planned went, how that parent conversation went, etc. 
5. Forced me outside to get some exercise as soon as I got home, so that I couldn't give the excuse of being in the middle of stuff. Refreshing and it always made planning easier. 

So... be understanding and kind. Encourage her to find a mentor at her school. Make fun plans (but please understand when she has a huge amount to do before the next day). Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Suggest that she start a DonorsChoose page. Also, check the Goodwills in your area — paperbacks start at 50¢ a pop and they often have copies of classics, just be prepared to spend some time combing through the shelves. Also check local libraries to see if they're having garage sales soon. Half Price Books will definitely have some copies, and they have a teacher discount. Also, reach out to former students who may have had their own copy that they wouldn't mind donating (she can even have them write an inscription on the inside cover...""Donated by Jane Smith, Class of 2015"" or whatever). Post on Facebook/Twitter/etc as well. Lots of your friends may still have their old high school/college lit books still sitting around collecting dust, and OMAM is common. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Honest question - how do we teach these kids that this non-communication is not going to serve them in the world we are preparing them for? The middle years are maybe a bit of a stretch with these real-world implications, but I really struggled with this as a high school teacher (English). Given the standards and curriculum, paired with the way that the world outside of our classroom operates, it seemed a disservice to not require some public speaking/discussion component and push these kids.

I love the idea presented about having them record presentations privately, but how do we reconcile this challenge with a larger experience?"
highschoolteachers,"Oh, and honestly, high school hiring committees will not see college level teaching as the kind of experience they're looking for. "
highschoolteachers,Hopefully someone who teaches K-8 will come and chime in. My only experience with stools is at the high school level.
highschoolteachers,"I tutor high school (and sometimes middle school) math. Lots of money to be made there. I started off slow when I was in college as a way to make ends' meet. Now, as a teacher, it's a good way to spend money on hobbies."
highschoolteachers,"My opinion stemmed from the idea that students should have a little more freedom in how they do their work. When forming that opinion, I failed to remember that teachers are really held to a gunpoint when it comes to student success. Again, that in itself is an issue. 

But yes, I do agree with you for the most part. Teachers need to engage students as best as possible and simply not give up on their students. I still feel that sometimes teachers should (But I guess not realistically) let go and let the student sink or swim on their own. The stakes are lower in high school, it's better to sink and have a teacher who cares and is willing to help you out rather then sinking and just being a number to a university professor. "
highschoolteachers,"I can think of many sad ones; I've shared on reddit before about a former student who committed suicide (when I was teaching at a university) and how utterly blindsided I was (you're never prepared for that, ever), but when I moved to high school, there were more sad stories that you're not prepared for until it happens, for the first time, in front of you: what do you do when your student can't turn in the homework because she's literally homeless and spends her time after school finding shelter with her mom; what do you do when your student can't stay awake in class because there is no food at home, so whatever the cafeteria served for breakfast is all he's had in 24 hours. I worked at a low income school, so things happened a lot...lots of windows into harsh realities that break your heart.

...but instead, I want to share something funnier, something I look back on from the very first semester of teaching and still go, ""WTF?"" This is that icebreaker story you share with colleagues when they're like, ""Oh, I had a student throw up once in class!"" 

I had a chronic masturbator.

**Story time:**

I teach high school; my first semester student teaching, I had a student, a senior, in my class who was known around the school for doing one thing in particular...placing his hoody or sweater in his lap, reaching under his pants, and masturbating whenever a female student would get up to do a presentation.

This happened in 9th grade. This happened in 10th grade. This happened in 11th grade.

Why, after *multiple* offenses, the administration did not remove the student from the school, I don't know. As a student teacher, you walk into an established culture, and the culture of that school was ""don't question the administration."" As I have no kind words to say about the administration of the school where I student taught, this student was *my* problem, and no admin wanted to hear a peep out of me. Plus, to his credit, he had yet to whip it out in my class. Yet.

As you might imagine, a student who does this type of behavior also might exhibit a host of other issues. This particular student was extremely antisocial (not in the clinical sense; I am not a licensed psychologist, and the layman definition is very different from the psychological profile) and, given his creepy behavior, no one wanted to be his friend. He would write compulsively, whether you were teaching or not, in all-capital letters in the scrawling handwriting one might expect to see written on a ransom note in a crumpled, black notebook that he always kept in front of him, positioned just-so.

Now, at this particular school, I was told what to teach. In grad school, you learn a lot, but let me tell you: maybe I just missed the class on ""what to do if your male student likes to masturbate in class while his female classmates stand in the front of the room,"" but I'm pretty sure I didn't. We covered assessments, we covered diversity, we covered backwards planning, but hey, I don't know - maybe we just never got around to masturbation and its role in the curriculum. 

Well, one week I look down at what I'm supposed to be teaching...and I shit you not, it's D.H. Lawrence's ""The Rocking Horse Winner.""

For those of you unfamiliar with that short story, let me sum it up in brief: ***it's a thinly veiled allegory about a young man who discovers the joys of masturbation.*** And I, a petite female teacher, get to stand up in front of the class with the Chronic Masturabtor, and teach it. By the way, did I mention that he never spoke? Oh, I called on him, but he wouldn't speak: he would only stare. And write. 

I mean, if you're sitting there right now, thinking, ""Wait, what? Go back to this short story,"" let me just pull a passage straight out of this to show you what I mean about 'thinly-veiled masturbation metaphor':

&gt;He went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the clue to 'luck'. Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck. He wanted luck, he wanted it, he wanted it. When the two girls were playing dolls in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse, charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls peer at him uneasily. Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them. The little girls dared not speak to him.

&gt;When he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into its lowered face. Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was wide and glassy-bright.

&gt;""Now!"" he would silently command the snorting steed. ""Now take me to where there is luck! Now take me!""

&gt;And he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he had asked Uncle Oscar for. He knew the horse could take him to where there was luck, if only he forced it. So he would mount again and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there.

&gt;""You'll break your horse, Paul!"" said the nurse.

&gt;""He's always riding like that! I wish he'd leave off!"" said his elder sister Joan.

By the way, the climax of the story is something straight out of *We Need to Talk About Kevin* - the mom walks in on the kid as he's furiously riding his rocking horse (...), and he looks at her and is able, to, uh...finish the ride.

So, how to handle this situation? Had the kid masturbated yet - well, no, but he had done it *in every one of his English classes every high school year prior.* I felt like I had a timebomb on my hands. I also didn't want to approach a teenage boy and discuss his masturbation habits with him for reasons related both to my desire not to jump off a bridge and the desire to not lose my license before I even had it. Plus, I didn't want to make him self conscious - did he creep me out? Sure, but our students evoke *a lot* of emotions in us, and a big part of our job is to not them know that all of the time so that they don't feel ashamed. Although maybe you should feel slightly ashamed about masturbating in front of young women, according to the law. I am not a lawyer. 

So, before class started, when he came in (and sat down at his 'group' of desks, which can normally accommodate 5 students, alone, as usual), I said, ""Hey [student name], how are you?"" I'm not sure if he replied, but I remember looking him dead-center in the eyes and saying as clearly as possible to convey my intended meaning, ""If you need to *go to the bathroom*, for *however long*, just raise your hand and let me know.""

And do you think he raised his hand during that 90-minute lesson?

***HELL NO.*** Kiddo just sat there grinning like an absolute madman. He didn't crack a smile all semester long, and there he was, ear to ear, like the fucking Joker, watching the goddamn world burn. 

But, an end to the story: later, I had to teach *1984* (which includes a rape fantasy and some other sex) and *Brave New World* *(which includes a drug-induced orgy). Both times his hand went up, and both times he was excused, sometimes uppwards of 30 minutes of class. I wasn't supposed to let more than one student out at a time, but I made an exception if he was the one in the bathroom, since I never knew how long he would take, and I was determined to avoid a masturbation incident, even at the cost of a reprimand from administration. I could tell when he was going to take a longer trip because he would say ""I need to use the bathroom"" instead of ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" Yes. And please, please remember to wash your hands (thought I).

So, do I wish I had done anything differently? I don't know. I still don't know. I'm glad I never tried to shame him or make *him* feel uncomfortable, even if inside I was personally creeped out. I do wish I had tried to push him more to integrate with the other students, but I spoke with colleagues who had had him and was assured that the social situation had escalated to a point where it was perhaps better for him to be by himself. They had known him for four years, so I trusted their judgement and followed their recommendation; I'm glad I was able to communicate my meaning to him about the bathroom, and I'm glad that no incident ever occurred.

More importantly, I have never taught that damn short story since. I'm not a prude, but damn, yo. Rocking horses. Jesus. "
highschoolteachers,"I just heard this one yesterday and I'll be using it next week on the second day of school with my high schoolers. You pass around a roll of toilet paper and tell the students to ""take what they need."" Some students will take like 10 squares, some will take 1 square. Then once everyone in the class has their toilet paper, however many squares they have is how many facts they have to say about themselves. 

I teach dance so the other activity I will be doing to learn everyone's names once we start dressing out is an add on name game. We go around the circle and each student comes up with a dance move for their name. We add on each dance move and name until we have a full dance and we repeat everyone's name with their dance move. Then we reverse it. Then I have the students mix up in a different order. I genuinely think it's fun! Haha and it does wonders for me learning names!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school in Australia, so Year 7 - Year 12 (ages 12-ish to 17/18-ish).

The kid who got violent was a Year 11 kid (so around 16 years old). I told him three times to put his mobile phone away. He decided to pull out an apple and a knife and start carving slices off the apple, then stabbing said slices with the knife, then eating them off the knife while maintaining eye contact with me. 

I didn't feel that this was an acceptable response to my perfectly reasonable request. Being aware of the class (a group of mostly Pacific Islander boys who I had taught for several years, who had not yet noticed what was going on) and fearing for their safety if any of them got involved, I started dialling the office from my pocket. Although I didn't feel it was the best option (but I didn't want to escalate the situation with the knife-wielding student) I stepped outside the room for about fifteen seconds, told the office to send admin to my classroom NOW because a student had a knife, then went back inside and kept teaching (again, because I was trying to keep the class from realising what was happening and not escalate the situation). All the while, with this student cutting away at the apple, glaring at me, and making larger flourishes with his knife every time he took another bite.

A few minutes later, our principal arrived and told the student to hand over the knife. He did. She then escorted him from the room.

Well, everything went wrong from there in terms of how my administration dealt with the incident. But I stuck to my guns, refused to accept the student back into the class, and kept at them until they suspended him (policy in my state is automatic two week suspension for a knife being brought to school - they sent him back to class the very next period, and I later found out that it was the second knife they'd confiscated from him that week. So I dug my heels in and refused to budge until they gave him some kind of consequence for his actions). I probably could have handled the whole thing better, but I did the best I could under the circumstances - the amount of adrenaline pumping through my veins left me feeling like I needed to vomit, that day."
highschoolteachers,"I actually stole it from one of my Calculus teachers in high school...I was so happy the day I made it onto the wall...not to mention it fills up an empty wall...

I actually just created light up marquee MVP letter in our school colors to really highlight the wall...I do a sports theme (1.  I love sports, 2.  I emphasize a team atmosphere in our room, 3.  It adds so much color)...so I have flags of my favorite teams and I have a board that monitors our standard progress (I do agile in the classroom, so in keeping with agile and sports, it says scrum over that wall).  

Our school is almost 100% continuing to a 4 year college and I have mainly freshmen, so this year, I am asking all of my students to tell me their dream college.  I am them ordering mini banners of all of the colleges they mention and hanging them below my whiteboard so the students see it everyday...I want them to see their aspiration college and be motivated by it, and I want them to feel special that their favorite college is up there."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school social studies. I have two things I do in the first two days. 

1. I give students a beginning of the year survey. 10 questions like ""what is your favorite movie,"" ""what is your best friend's name,"" ""favorite teacher from last year,"" things like that. Then we go around the room and students pick one thing to share from their list and tell the class which superpower they wish they had. I save the questionnaires all year and have the students answer other questions throughout the year. On the last day of school I pass their question packets back and suggest they put them in their yearbook so in the future when they look through that year's yearbook they have a historical record of themselves for that year. Letting them pick which answer to share and which superpower they want helps bond students instantly I think. 

2. The second thing I do is have students list everything they've done in the last 24 hours, then provide a piece of evidence that they completed that. So if they went to Subway for lunch, their receipt is their evidence. It has to be a hard piece of evidence. It's a fun activity that gets students talking with each other, trying to figure out what a piece of evidence would be for something like listening to One Direction. The evidence has to be something a historian could easily use. 

Both of these things are fun at any age and get students engaged with each other and the content of social studies. Best of luck this year! "
highschoolteachers,"After the rigor I went through to get my 6-12 high school mathematics license, I'm actually shocked!"
highschoolteachers,"Thats the thing, my middle school generalist license wouldn't reciprocate, so they just 'gave' me a high school English license.

Crazy, but true."
highschoolteachers,"You are fucking wrong. You see I read this whole bullshit conversation and I shut my mouth up until this point. You are judged by your students as that is your work. I am judged by engineering and design of my systems as that is my work. If you don't believe in each student you failed. It's just not the job for you. 

What really pisses me off is the fact that I was one of those slacker kids in high school. The type of kid that teachers portrayed as the lazy student. I had two types of teachers the type that tried to fascinate me and make learning stimulating and the type that assigned 20 vocabulary words as a bullshit activity so they could take a break. If they don't want to study the vocabulary make it an engaging experience put the extra effort in with that kid. See kids aren't lazy, they for the most part just lack that quick response stimulation they are used to receiving in modern society. Kids are confused and usually don't receive instant gratification from incremental learning but we know through longitudinal data and studies there is great benefits.

So let's discuss some solutions to engage these students in a positive manor. I think the first thing would be to learn the etymology and history of the vocabulary words that is usually fascinating. Next move on to crosswords or a more exciting activity that would keep a kid like myself interested. They will learn faster and respect you. I'm telling you this not as a teacher I'm an Electrical Engineer, I design substations across the country my point in saying this is teachers gave up hope that I was going to achieve because frankly I just lacked some stimulation in the classroom to get those neurons flowing. Thankfully I had a few great teachers that led me on the righteous path. I'm 24 years old probably around your age so this is not coming from an adult figure just from a peer. I'd love to hear back -Maximus"
highschoolteachers,Can you teach high school with a middle school generalist license?

highschoolteachers,"Thanks. It is nice to be respectful and courteous, isn't it?

The reason your part time summer job analogy doesn't work is because high school isn't a workplace. (Yes, I tell my students that being a student is their full-time, priority-number-one job just like I'm sure you and many others do. But that doesn't mean it should be treated like a workplace.)

I'd like to think you'd agree with me that natural consequences are the best type of consequences, when they're an option. I'd imagine you have some natural consequences available in the scenario you described.

Also, if the student didn't really care about completing the first 20 vocab words, what's the likelihood he'll complete the second 20? What happens to the student who comes back for the next class without his work completed?"
highschoolteachers,"Since you think I'm being a little naive, I'll go ahead and state where my opinions come from.

Out of my family of 5, 4 of them are teachers that teach from the high school to elementary school level. I hear about their experiences and what works and doesn't from them mainly. I myself also tutor a small group of kids so I have limited first hand experience. I also attempt to keep up with the latest in education. But I've spoken with many teachers and done my own research for the past 3 years to find out what's best for learning. So excuse me if my views are young and idealistic, but I stand by my ideas until I see they don't work. 


"
highschoolteachers,I know of 2 middle school math/science and 2 high school math off the top of my head!
highschoolteachers,"&gt; If you foster the love of learning, the rest falls into place.

Unfortunately, this is an idealistic and naive statement. It ignores a lot of psychological, biological, sociological, economic, cultural (etc.) factors that would take far too long to explore.

&gt; Also, teachers in general shouldn't force their students to work when they have free time.

Ignoring the fact that the time I give to work on homework *isn't* free time, this is also naive and ignores other factors (such as drop-in observations from admin).

&gt; I say this because when those students go to college they won't have anyone breathing down their neck, it's all on them. It's better they figure that out in high school where the stakes are lower.

This is true. I prepare them in other ways for the independence of a post-high school world.

&gt; And as far as me being condescending, I simply put forward a different perspective that isn't seen around here much. 

No, you're insulting me while you do it.

&gt; But it's also good for teachers to hear what the students think from time to time. 

Agreed, but this doesn't automatically validate what students believe."
highschoolteachers,I'm a high school physics teacher. If you need some lesson plans let me know through PM and I'd be happy to share!
highschoolteachers,"If you foster the love of learning, the rest falls into place. Being responsible about your work comes naturally after that.

And as far as me being condescending, I simply put forward a different perspective that isn't seen around here much. Is it as extreme as I made it out to be? Probably not. But it's also good for teachers to hear what the students think from time to time. "
highschoolteachers,"My husband managed to get the summer off with me. He works in manufacturing, and his company has been shut down for some major renovations, so we've had gobs and gobs of time together. It has been wonderful because normally we're like two ships passing in the night with schedules opposite each other, so I am really going to miss being able to spend so much time with him going on adventures and just being able to connect. Also, pretty much everything that you mentioned in your post! 

This year I'll be at the middle school level and all of my previous experience is high school, so I'm looking forward to a new challenge and a change of gears! I don't have children of my own, so I'm also really looking forward to the simple day to day interactions with the kids, too."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a middle school physical science teacher with 12 years of experience. Let me give you some hints.

Don't just do notes. Notes are boring. The first thing you should do is figure out how you want to break your class up into units. Measurement. Linear motion. Circular motion. Things like that. 

After you have decided what your first unit will be, decide what kinds of activities you want your students to do. If you're starting with something really simple like displacement and speed and simple linear motion, work out what you want to cover as notes and how you want to then implement that knowledge. Find some worksheets where they apply the formulas that you are teaching. Then, create (or borrow) hands on labs that the kids can use.

I like to start with the big picture. *What are my over all topics?* Then, I look at the subtopics of those topics. *What exactly do the kids need to know about this?* Then, I look at how I can make them use the knowledge. *What's an activity that we can do?*

Once you've gotten that out of the way, I suggest breaking your class period into manageable chunks. 5 minutes to go over last night's homework. 20 minutes of direct instruction/guided practice. 10 minutes of independent practice/go over that independent practice. 10 minutes to start on tonight's homework. Tomorrow there will be a lab. (Don't really have a lab every other day. You'll drive yourself insane.)

Work on one unit at a time. Spend the first week getting to know the kids and assessing their level of knowledge. 

Don't beat yourself up when things don't work. Heck, there are times when I say to my students, ""Okay, kids, I've never done this before. This whole thing could crash and burn. Let's see what happens."" They're usually pretty cool with that.

Oh, and one last thing, high school kids can be big assholes. Don't let them get to you. Don't try to be their friend. Don't try to get them to think you're cool. Just go in there and teach."
highschoolteachers,"I explain my expectations at the start of class, and anyone who doesn't follow then gets sent out to the hall for a conference without a second warning. Whisper something while I'm talking? Boom, out in the hall. Not doing work, or leaving your seat? To the hall with you! I make them stew for a few minutes, give them a quick ""Stop being a fuck-up"" speech, then let them in.

My students are in high school, so they're old enough to have learned the right behavior. Any student who requires getting sent out twice gets referred to the office. I write a lot of referrals in the first few weeks but then very few after that."
highschoolteachers,"Will definitely check it out! Still looking for my first job and wouldn't mind moving, especially there! Are math middle/high school jobs available to your knowledge?"
highschoolteachers,"This kid wants it both ways.

On one hand, he says high school students ""will soon go on to pursue their future,"" but he also implies work isn't worth doing if it's not fun.

Life isn't all about fun. Sometimes you have to tough it out and do what you're told. If you blow off your work, your boss will get pissed and give you the shit jobs if he doesn't outright fire you. Homework is like that. Teachers can only do so much to make things interactive. If students still blow it off, they need to be held accountable.

All this aside, my approach gets me results. Teenagers can cry all they want about it. I don't care as long as it works. (:"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a (high school) student who isn't lazy, and that still kinda sounds like a dick move..."
highschoolteachers,"LOL.  I know it's frustrating but I have not had my schedule until preplanning every year that I've taught (9 I think).  Some years it has changed mid week.  My father is a principal and I've watched him for 30 something years deal with scheduling over the summer.  It is VERY hard.  Even if there were no teacher turn over, the scheduling is hard.  Add to that people leaving, going on sabbatical, going part time, new people, and the district messing about with how many units you get, scheduling is a nightmare.  You're in a smaller school so maybe there is an aspect of ""his time""  but it may just be that it's really hard, especially in a high school where you have to worry about graduation requirements."
highschoolteachers,"Recent graduate from high school here. Seriously, don't do this. This will only make your students dislike you. First off, you're making a dislike for learning. Second, you're really showing that you can't handle a class if you have to punish everyone for the actions of one. That's something you do to kids in elementary school, not high schoolers that will soon go on to pursue their future. "
highschoolteachers,"Short answer? None.

Longer answer? Nooooooonnnnne.

I don't see how the same students taking AP courses should also be pandered to with silly things like gamifying their education. Middle school, perhaps, but not high school.

&gt; It feels like bribing the students.

Because that's what gamification is."
highschoolteachers,"I always tell kids (high school) what my first name is and make a joke about how they should let me know if they find anything interesting when they Google me (there's only two with my name in the world that I've found, and most of the stuff on Google is about the other one).   I have taught at schools where the teachers went by Miss/Mrs. (first name) or Mr. (first name) if the teachers wanted to, and I actually really liked that.  Some principals have really strong feelings about this, so I'd check with yours first.  But in my experience, most Spanish teachers just end up being plain old Señorita or Señora, maybe with the first letter of the last name if there's more than one. So that might be an option if the first name thing doesn't fly!"
highschoolteachers,"Pasco moved 6th grade down to the elementary level so lots of teachers jumped ship and went to middle-high school or surrounding districts. They have had maasive growth in students every year and the mix of lots of retirees each year is making an impact. From what I was told, the district is working closely with the state and the teacher candidates to get them certified ASAP with the school year coming up soon. They are also in a battle with the union versus the district so that isn't really helping anything. They are currently in the mediation process and are seeking a raise. 
I appreciate you posting that link! Here are the Washington teacher salaries...I wish I could be more district specific!!

highschoolteachers,"This happens to me every year. I have a license in two subject areas (high school) and have a ""standing"" agreement that my boss can put me where he needs me most. Some years that's English, some years it's Social Studies, some years it's both. I generally find out 3-4 days before I see students. 

I generally start out the year with something that could apply to either class, like a culture project or family tree/name project. It gives me a week to get ahead of the students. "
highschoolteachers,My high school Calc teacher did a calculator and no calculator two part test. The theory or conceptual ideas were tested on the no calculator and the more computation based questions (large number heavy) were on the calculator. That way he could test on who knew the basic ideas in general and who knew how to apply them to the subject. It didn't matter if you plugged stuff into your calculator before-hand if you didn't know the basic ideas or concepts. I am planning on doing this for most of my tests in the future (only 1 more year of college!).
highschoolteachers,"I think it really depends.  Are you a *high school* teacher and a recent college grad?  If so, I'd say absolutely not because you want to create a clear distinction between yourself and your students.

It also depends on your school culture.  If other teachers allow first-name usage you might consider it... but if there is a 10 year or smaller age gap between you and your oldest student I would NOT do it."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school math teacher, so I don't offer much in the way of extra credit.

I do give each student 3 'restroom passes' at the beginning of each quarter, and for any unused ones that they keep and return at the end of the quarter I give 2 extra credit points -- I feel this is justified as it rewards staying in my classroom and not needing to leave it -- if you can come into class every day and not have forgotten your materials, plan on using the restroom before/after my class, and aren't going out to get a drink every day, I feel is justified for a small reward. 

The only other 'extra credit'esque thing I do is allow for test retakes within 2 weeks of a returned test. The caveat is that in order to retake a test, they need to (1) come in either after school or during lunch to look over their test and ask any questions about anything they missed (I pass back tests, let kids look at them for a few minutes, and collect them again -- when they come in to check their tests I make a judgment call on whether they can be left to their own devices in finding what they need to work on or if I should prompt a conversation and look into their thought processes more), and then (2) I don't take the higher grade, nor the average, but the second test grade. It is my belief (learning disabilities exempted) and has been fairly reliable that if you study, look at what you didn't know the first time, and ask questions, the second test is ALWAYS the higher grade - the retakes are not any harder, just uses different numbers. I do this to emphasize to students that retaking a test means buckling down and focusing on learning the material, and that it requires extra time on my part not only to create another test, but to grade it as well. Every year I have one or two students who slack off and inevitably get a lower grade, but for some of my struggling students who really just need more time or have test anxiety are able to better anticipate what is going to be tested. "
highschoolteachers,"To do list:

* Room set-up (decor/posters, desk arrangement, tech ready to go, etc.)
* Syllabus or course handout (introduction of class purpose, semester goals/objectives, attendance policy, classroom rules, materials needed, contact information, etc.)
* Copies. (Syllabus, first day activity / icebreaker, week 1, and first unit if possible.)
* Seating chart. With some classes/years, I let them sit where they like on the first day and make the seating chart based on who annoyed me. With other groups, I start with a seating chart to help smooth the first day. 

On the first day, I have the students make hanging file folders for crates at the back of my classroom where they will store their work (and receive back graded work) throughout the semester. Then, I go over my syllabus and make sure to point out anything that might be very different in my class compared to others. The students receive a lot of information on that first day (from 6+ teachers), so I try not to overwhelm them with anything that we could easily talk about later in the semester as it comes up. I take attendance and assure students I will learn their names or nicknames and how to pronounce them correctly. I explain my icebreaker and show my own example, and then I give the students time to work on theirs so they don't end up with homework. Then, I just float around and help out anyone who seems to be struggling and make sure the group doesn't get too loud. 

I have taught Composition (grade 11) for 8 years at a public high school with 58 minute classes, if that helps provide some context for the information here.  (I'll be starting as a full-time Special Ed teacher this fall, so I'm interested to see how my back-to-school to do list changes!)"
highschoolteachers,"My kind of motto is that I share positive things and I don't share things that high schoolers can use to begin to ask inappropriate questions. Questions about significant others and non-academic experiences in college are off-limits. 

Usually, my personal life will come through funny stories or when my Seniors want to learn about my life experiences because they're interested in learning about adulthood (that part of teaching Seniors is FUN!). 

There is something to be said too for the fact that there are a lot of things that I don't say to entire classes, but that I'll tell students about when they come into my room at lunch or after school. I had a ""lunch crew"" during both lunches last school year, and so they usually heard more than my other students (however, I still didn't talk about personal-personal issues). "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school with about 150 students in total.  I guess most parents are over meeting the teacher; I have never had more than 15 parents come in, so it doesn't really work out.  Most of those parents' students aren't really in need of parental oversight anyway.  I'm trying to make this as painless as possible for the lazy yet well-meaning parent."
highschoolteachers,"I only offer extra credit to my high school history classes for the students that complete elaborate study materials before they take a test. These study aids can gain them up to 10% which is a letter grade. My students are generally low achieving students since it is a credit recovery school and they all have some gap in their education history, so any way to reinforce good study skills is good."
highschoolteachers,Sound like dropping out of high school. Don't do it. 
highschoolteachers,"I had to do the same thing for my interview, but high school. :) I did a lecture where my students would normally be taking notes, and I totally treated my admin like my students. I did do my lesson on interjections, so when it came time to ""practice"", I had my admin shout all the words on the screen out, like ""neato!"" Or ""Shoot!"" Etc. I highly recommend this, both to get the experience of watching your admin do this and to show how interactive you can be. ;) Obviously, do it with content appropriate for your kiddos, but they really enjoyed making their silly sentence with conjunctions and interjections and shouting out the words. I think that lesson is what got me the job. 

I'm crossing my fingers for you!"
highschoolteachers,"Hey!!! That's amazing! Congrats! I just did my model lesson for a spanish high school position and got the job so here are my suggestions:
- make your lesson interactive; come up with something that is entertaining but educational and make the administrators do something!
- show them you know how to set up a lesson. Have an introduction, main activity, and closure, even if they're really simple
- a random suggestion that i think made me look much more professional was that i made folders to hand out to the people there to observe the lesson. While i was setting up they were all able to look through. I included my certificates, resume, cover letter. Anything you think helps make you look good! I made about 10 folders even though there were only 4 people -- that way i was covered if more people showed up. Also include your lesson plan for the mini lesson
- incorporate technology; schools love to see this!


I wish you the best of luck!!! You got this!!!"
highschoolteachers,"In my experience, once a student takes a ""break"" from school, they typically never come back to finish. It is definitely not a wise idea in general. 

I had a student who was in a band and he had multiple senior years because his attention was way too divided between school and music. (I would think that musical career refers to a band or something along those lines)

I would encourage the student to finish high school first so he is not in a pickle if his musical career falls through. If the student is adamant about pursuing their career, encourage them to look at business or management courses at their local community college. It will help them out when their career takes off and it can serve as a safety net for that student. 

Our students are still teenagers, they don't have the best long term planning so they may not forsee failure. Whatever the case is, definitely encourage the student to pursue a path where he keeps many options open for himself. Not finishing high school is not necessarily that bad as long as they have alternate options for the future. "
highschoolteachers,"in my high school we could use our own calculators for math class, but our teacher handed out calculators we had to use on test day.

It's an expensive solution, but it works."
highschoolteachers,"Isn't that the same as dropping out of high school? Why would a high schooler leave and then come back? I think I would tell him to stick it out for senior year and then pursue his musical career. If he doesn't like that idea, he could always just get his GED. "
highschoolteachers,"I think that is a good answer, especially if you weren't expecting that question. I've dealt with a few irate parents (mostly over the topic of citations- ridiculous) and I always INSIST that the student (middle high school) is present at any conference- that way we can both talk with the student and there is no he/said-she/said later. I also document everything- phone calls ect. Luckily, admin has always supported me so I often BCC any emails to the admin just so they know whats up. 

Honestly, I don't blame the parents. They are usually SUPER stressed out. I'be had parents go from irate to crying in 20 minutes. As soon as I can identify the underlying fear and address that directly, we can get on the same page and come up with a plan. "
highschoolteachers,"Good answer. Being relatable is the key to getting consistent respect, effort and motivation. At the end of last year, when students were given summer school notifications, and were visibly upset, I informed them that I too had to take summer school, and that I wasn't a very good high school student. They appreciate the honesty, because they often view adults and liars and the enemy.  "
highschoolteachers,"For seating charts, I give one at the beginning of the year so I can learn names...no room for debate with students on that one.  After 3-4 weeks, I tell each section that I will allow them to sit wherever they like until they can't handle it anymore...I reserve the right to implement a chart at any time.  Over the years, I've only had a couple of sections that ever got a seating chart through the whole year, and a couple more where a couple of students were not allowed to sit within three desks of each other but everyone else could sit wherever.  Most of the time they tend to drift toward the same spots anyway.  I teach high school, though, so I'm not sure if this would work with MS.  The concept certainly fits your vision though!"
highschoolteachers,"I have taught both high school and middle school. When I was single, I had this freakishly small class scheduled at the high school -- only about 17 students by some fluke in the counseling office.  Somehow, they figured out I was dating (either overheard me talking to another teacher or pieced it together from me not talking about a boyfriend or husband).  They teased me relentlessly but were adorably good-natured about it. It was a writing class so every time we did a sample assignment on the board and they got to choose the topic, it would either be about a bad date or a euphemism for sex. Some of their creative writing pieces sent me on dates with Ronald McDonald and Andrew Lincoln from *The Walking Dead*. We made outlines for breakfast food that got entirely creepy based on their insistence that you must PROTECT your lap with a napkin before eating. I mean, truly, it was all so ridiculous but completely silly and harmless in the end. Not that every class would react that way and turn out so positive, but it sort of restored my faith in [teenage] humanity. 

When I taught middle school, I was already with my SO. High schoolers usually ask like ""What does he do?"" or ""What kind of car does he drive?"" but the middle schoolers wanted to know (and I could not make this up), ""Does he have hair in his armpits?"" "
highschoolteachers,"Fellow Oregonian here, although I'm working in California right now! Bad news, I'm 90% sure that in Oregon, you must do a credential program through an accredited university. To teach high school, you need the credential which requires a certain amount of student teaching and classes. Check out the [TSPC](http://www.oregon.gov/TSPC/Pages/index.aspx) - the Oregon licensing agency for more details on credentialing requirements, although be warned they will not reply to phone calls or emails. I did my credential and MEd at PSU (my BA was in History), which was OK, but it general the programs are pretty much just hoops you have to jump through. If you don't want to do a credentialing program, stick with University teaching.

I haven't taught university, but from my experience, high school students are way below where I think they should be! If you want to be a high school teacher, the only way you can be successful is if you legitimately love and can deal with teenagers. I spend way more of my time teaching my kids how to handle the world and growing up than I do talking about content, so if you're all math all the time and don't want to deal with behavior management or hormonally-crazed 14 year olds, stick with University. Don't be a high school teacher if you're not really passionate about it. It is too much bullshit to deal with otherwise. Please PM me if you have more questions about Oregon stuff or working with high schoolers. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"High school is like the knuckle-breaker, I am going to guess. I have 0 teaching experience but in high school, people had the ""I wont need this, I wont learn this"" mentality. Try shadowing something other than high school as high school =/= middle school =/= elementary school "
highschoolteachers,I'm in my fifth year teaching at a high school in central Florida. Feel free to pm me any questions you may have that are specifically about Florida.
highschoolteachers,"Ghosts of Mars is a super cheesy John Carpenter horror flick, that I'd say is at least high school appropriate. I like it because it's corny enough that it won't ruin anyone's day who isn't being vocal about not wanting to watch a scary movie, but ridiculous enough that no one will get bored. I also like that it takes place on an actual planet, so there's something related to actual science in there.

A better movie is Pitch Black, which is totally space related and scary, but in a totally fabricated world. There's also some very brief drug content (not at all glorifying it) and sexually suggestive language, but no sex scenes as far as I can recall. Despite the fake world, they do take advantage of it to do some cool stuff and you can use it to motivate a conversation about different solar systems. If you haven't seen the movie, they basically crash land on what seems to be a desert planet that gets intense sunlight nonstop because of a binary star system or something. But there's a single period in the solar system's cycle that causes all light to be blocked off, and there are some very hungry light-phobic monsters underground.."
highschoolteachers,"Depending on the student, I think inclusion can be a good option as long as there is a teacher's aide in the class. It should probably be used with LD as opposed to ID kids though, at least in middle and high school settings."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; (Some also candidly wrote that they never read required reads either... they just read sparknotes and paid attention in other ELA classes and somehow got by.)

I'm an ELA teacher now. I actually got through pretty much all of high school and a good share of my undergrad without doing required reading. In undergrad, I did a lot of skimming (and, quite frankly, it would've been a whole lot easier to write analytical essays if I had just read the stuff...I ended up reading at least a third of each novel while I was looking for information for essays). Other than that, I just took in a lot during classroom discussions.

Since first grade (I could barely write my name at the end of kindergarten, and something clicked over that summer), I've been a voracious reader. I read all kinds of stuff outside of class readings. There really wasn't a ton of sizable YA titles when I was a kid, so I went straight into a lot of adult literature.

It's just that, when reading was assigned, I had a really hard time making myself do it. That's still the case, though I'm better about it. For that reason, I sympathize with my students, but I also tell them that, based on my firsthand knowledge, it's a lot easier to do well if you simply do what you're supposed to do..."
highschoolteachers,"I have this problem - inner city teaching has a culture of not doing homework when kids rise to high school, and we aren't allowed to include it much in the grade by policy.   I don't have any perfect solutions, but I did have some success in having students present their homework solutions immediately upon return - not all, but a few - as a regular practice, on the smart board.   If you call on a kid who hasn't done it, reinforce (gently) the cool-factor of being able to present by really celebrating those who have, and reinforcing that as a basic expectation.  The attraction to use the technology, once established as a norm, is a nice positive reinforcing tool to bring homework return up.  "
highschoolteachers,"Have you looked into K-12? It's an online high school, kinda like online college classes.

highschoolteachers,That book terrified me and I read it senior year of high school
highschoolteachers,"Obviously, it depends on the student, but in general I tend to think that most special ed students should not be in general education classes. I have quite a few students who have 504s and IEPs, and those with IEPs range from ADHD to Autism to Emotional/Behavioral Disorders. In one of my classes, 50% of the students have an IEP. That's a LOT of differentiation and it is absolutely exhausting. I know students are slipping through the cracks because I'm simply unable to give each student what he or she needs according to their accommodations in my class. And when it comes to additional test time and/or time for assignments... it's rough in a high school classroom to be able to provide that, especially without singling out the students in front of their peers. I want all my students to do and have their best, but I don't think that's in my general education classroom for the majority of them."
highschoolteachers,"are you a male elementary teacher as well?

you raise an interesting point. However, it's not really one I considered to be a part of the problem... I've worked in schools in some form or another for the past 5 years. I've been a para at 2 middle schools for 2 years each, and a student teacher at a high school/a student teacher and TA at an elementary school for a year. In all of these cases I've got along with the staff fantastically, although there was always a pretty even balance of men and women. This is the first school I've been in where even the principal is a woman, so it feels very much like ""woman's territory""

"
highschoolteachers,"I teach at a small high school most teachers have 3 or 4 preps , but yes a new teacher should never have more than 2"
highschoolteachers,"&gt; When kids in these two similar datasets were asked **how much time they spent on math homework** each day, those in the NELS study said 37 minutes, whereas those in the ELS study said 60 minutes.

All they are looking at is amount of time spent on homework vs. grades.  This is one of the worst metrics to try and rate the effectiveness of homework I could possibly think of.  Self reporting is notoriously inaccurate for starters.  Second - you would expect your most highly performing students to complete the same assigned task more quickly.   Trying to measure the effectiveness of homework as a teaching tool is like trying to measure the effectiveness of using PowerPoint during lessons.   Are you using it primarily to organize graphics, links, and prompts in an interactive class discussion?   Or are you dumping a wall of text on each slide and reading it verbatim to the class from your lectern?   Ineffective teachers will assign mountains of busy work and it will be a tedious waste of time.  That doesn't mean *homework* itself is evil.

I'm a high school Chemistry teacher.  I believe that **well designed** homework assignments that tie into the overall instruction plan are a vital part of student success.   To me well designed means:

* No more than 10-15 min/night for the average student.  Remember you are usually one of EIGHT teachers this kid has.

* provides timely feedback (either checked/gone over at the start of class the next day, or given in some online and interactive system which provides right/wrong answer feedback in real time.)

* provides the student an immediate benefit, such as having 1-2 questions copied from the homework onto the day's quiz.

* typically begun during class, with 30-50% completed before they leave as I circulate and check for understanding.  I want to know they know what they are doing before I turn them loose to be lost and confused on their own.
 "
highschoolteachers,"I go by Mrs Lastname which is pretty standard here in NZ. However, at high school level, students generally use miss and sir/mr rather than names. When I was student teaching in a female teacher's class they would end up talking about 'miss' and 'other miss'!

I also volunteer with a group teaching music in primary schools. We use first names there. Students at one of the schools have started calling us whaea firstname, as that is the expectation for regular teachers at their school. It's the Maori word for mother or aunt and is often used as a title for female teachers."
highschoolteachers,"You might need to give then a reality check. I say just sit there and do nothing. See how they react to you sitting there doing nothing, telling them nothing. Then when one of them asks why your doing nothing, tell them you don't know what to do. Let them know they are way behind and that you have tried everything on your end. It's up to them to learn. Up to them to move on to high school. Remind them it's up to you if they move on or not. They will not go to high school when they are not mature enough to pay attention"
highschoolteachers,"You are not, nor will you likely ever be, your students' friend (of course they may become your friends when they are older, but probably not). You should be approachable and fair (and maybe nice sometimes), but you are in charge. A friend that is acts that way is an asshole.

A few teachers in my school go by Mr/s. Firstname or Mr/s. Nickname. We are pretty strict on the Mr/s. because we feel that learning to show respect to the people in charge (not blindly following, respect is different) is an important part of middle school and high school.

I will admit that I have personally always had an issue with the lack of formality that a lot of people have. Even when I was young it felt like adults were just trying to deny that they were actually experienced people (of course I still rebelled against their experience when I was young) when they asked to be called by their first name. (I am from New England, not the South)"
highschoolteachers,"I think age level plays into this as well. Elementary school age kids are more likely to find an adult who goes by their first name cool because it relaxes the social distinction between children and adults. 

I have known high school kids like the one you overheard, and in their case at least calling a teacher Mr. Smith set up a clear boundary between student and teacher. The students wanted that boundary because they like to think of their teacher as separate from them and feel threatened by teachers trying to get too close. It's a balancing act. 

So yes, the school culture and climate plays into it, but the ages do too. "
highschoolteachers,"I think as a teaching artist, you're in a unique position. If you were a full time teacher in one or two buildings, I'd say bite the bullet and go last name. Since you're not, I think the first name thing is ok. In someways, it adds legitimacy to you as an artist.

My Brother-in-law owns an advertising agency and he is artist in resident at the local arts magnet and at the high school I'm in. The kids call him Cody and think he's cool creative type. He is, but I think if he was Mr. Last name he'd just be another grownup telling them what to do. "
highschoolteachers,"One thing my high school English teacher used to do was have selected students read out exemplary work (once assessed) to the class.  He would try to pick different people every time, so long as their work was actually up to snuff.  I always felt so embarrassed but so proud when he picked me.  Might something like that work?  

I have also been considering a 'student of the day' award for stand-out performance in class.  I'd record their name on the board all day and then it would be added to a raffle for prizes.  Is that ridiculous?  Sometimes I feel like I come up with so many ideas that they all sound like nonsense after a while.  Thank you!!"
highschoolteachers,"I started a PGCE in September, although it's at a high school. If you want to really impress incorporate some assessment for learning within your lesson. Also ask if you can have a copy of the seating plan on your desk while teaching so you can address the students by name,  makes it way easier to ask questions and/or address any behaviour issues. Good luck! "
highschoolteachers,What's the pay like and how would a person in the US without a teaching license teach there? I was a lts for high school physics and have a B.S. in chemistry. The teaching climate in the US is awful so I'm in the corporate world now.
highschoolteachers,"I'm honest - I've never done drugs, and I drink occasionally (but not often).  If they ask about high school, yeah, I drank sometimes before it was legal. But I tell them that I was doing it because I didn't like myself very much - and neither did the people who only liked me when I was drinking - and that I wish I'd realised that at the time.

It normally only comes up for me in a pastoral setting, so I don't think it's inappropriate to be honest and have a discussion with my older students in that context. If it was the middle of a history lesson, or Year 8 English, then yeah, I'm not going to answer that. Let's stay on topic."
highschoolteachers,"I was a sub for a year and a half. It's entirely up to you, but when I started subbing I made a list of subjects I felt comfortable *enough* subbing for. Most teachers assume that their sub may not have the total content knowledge that is needed to execute a master lesson.

I am certified in 6-12 English and 6-8 Math. Based on my personal skills and abilities, I took sub jobs in any middle school subject except French and Woodshop/""Tech Ed"", and I accepted high school jobs in English, Social Studies, Performing Arts and Home Ec. 

Now that I'm teaching full time, I design my lesson plans so that the sub gives an assignment and the kids work on it. As a sub, I never encountered a sub plan that actually asked me to execute a lesson; I don't ask my subs to pull off a full lesson plan. I subbed in areas I was comfortable in just so I could walk in knowing that I could *probably* answer questions during the lesson. But don't stress. You could accept a job in a subject you know zero things about and no one would likely know. 

Edit: a word"
highschoolteachers,"Absolutely, 100% agree. My philosophy always has been to quench the thirst for knowledge, whatever it may be. I indulge valuable student questions in my high school history classes all the time.

Just the other day, I was conducting a discussion of the differences among capitalism, socialism, and communism, and a student raised his hand and asked me if the ""cut open"" spaces on an [interrupted projection](http://i.imgur.com/L9D0Hl9.gif) of a world map that I had on my bulletin board were transversable by plane, or if you'd have to go around them. I laughed, and explained the differences in map projections for about 2 minutes before moving on.

I'm never going to say no to answering an honest, intrinsically developed question. There's far too little of it out there for me to actively stifle academic inquisition."
highschoolteachers,"I was worried about there being an age restriction here, but I got lucky. And I love subbing for middle and high school. I am super strict going in each day. I first list my two rules, the consequences for breaking those rules, and then my reward system. I have received wonderful feedback from every teacher that I've subbed for, the administration, and the security officers on campus. I love my job and cannot wait to be finished with school so that I can make it my career. "
highschoolteachers,"Don't give up. Things will get better. Just give it time. Learn to speak with a deeper voice, perfect that teacher glare, and show that you mean what you say. If you threaten consequences for bad behavior, follow through. Every time. Otherwise, they will take advantage of you. I am only 19. I weigh 92 pounds. And I am 4 ft 11. I sub in high school and middle school often and am working on my degree in education. Good luck, and remember: perfect that teacher glare!!"
highschoolteachers,"As a special educator and also someone who struggled in school with learning as a child, I can appreciate your situation.  I really do hope you find some success for your child.   But bear with me while I question critically some of what I read you saying.  

What makes you think what you describe qualifies as 'unprofessional conduct'?  Or is it more that you mostly didn't ""appreciate"" or like what she had to say?  You might want to look into what the professional conduct requirements of a principal are exactly before making a such a serious accusation.  Don't send email when you're feeling angry after a bad meeting.  Give it some time and reflect first. (Also consider the potential fall-out since you work in the same board.)

I understand that parents feel the need to advocate for their children and it can be a challenge to help them succeed in school.  I know that parents feel the need to demand more, and the need to push until (ideally) the issues are solved.  But know that educators care, and a school is typically is doing the best they can day to day to support all the different children.  (As a teacher it can get pretty ridiculous when a third to almost half the students in the school all have IEPs with special individualized accommodations.  It just isn't realistic. )

That being said I've worked with some amazing students coping with severe dyslexia and dysgraphia.  Their IEPS's provided accommodation because they needed speech recognition for writing and print to speech adaptive technologies in order to be successful in high school.  In those cases the learning problems to resolve had nothing to do with the child's poor behavior choices.   

In our system, (which may be similar to yours) modifications mean the curriculum is delivered at a reduced level from the regular program.  Its usually reserved for children at the lower percentile of intellectual capacity (which doesn't sound like your child).    Accommodation is most often what's in an IEP for most children... double time for assessments, distraction free seating arrangements, adaptive learning technologies etc 

Also from what you've described, it sounds like your child can potentially be rather difficult at times?  Perhaps that's the way things are, and it's not necessarily the fault of the teacher, principal or the school?  Isn't it entirely possible that some of his learning and behavior issues are also at times from poor choices on his part? Maybe that's part of where the principal is coming from?  Maybe he does need to take on some of the responsibility for his choices as a student? 
"
highschoolteachers,"Just to make sure you're aware, if you're getting a 4-8 cert you wouldn't be able to teach anything other than those grades, either kindergarten, first grade, or high school."
highschoolteachers,You wouldn't actually be allowed to sub at our district until you were 20. You're one tough cookie if you sub middle/high school. 
highschoolteachers,"I understand your concerns. I am a very small 19 year old female. And I sub for all ages. In fact, I sub in high school at least twice a week. Be firm when you go in, be professional. State your rules right away. And then state the consequences if those rules are broken. Be honest about your age. They don't want BS from you, just like you don't want any from them. As soon as you give them your age, redirect their attention to the lesson/assignment. Middle school and high school may seem scary at first, but as long as you do the things I've mentioned, you'll do well. Th students will come to respect you, as will the teachers. I have several teachers that have asked for my cell number, and will call or text me to request that I sub for them. An important thing to remember, while being firm, remain courteous and caring. The students should know that while you expect them to behave, and will hold them to your expectations, you care about them. If a child misbehaves, talk to them about it after class or out in the hallway. Find out if there is anything bothering them, and if there is anything you can do to help. This will also gain their respect. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a second-year teacher in a multi-grade classroom. Most of the students at our school are low achievers and/or cognitively impaired. We have two high school teachers who ""don't play nice"" with the rest of the staff, insomuch that they actually conspire and stir up drama within the tiny community to ""push"" out other staff members. (I wish I could say that it were actually as crazy as it sounds, but it's true; the rest of us are baffled about who any of this could truly benefit, including themselves.)

Today, I put out a call for a set of eighth-grade textbooks that I needed for my eighth-graders since last year; the set I had was destroyed in a flood and the insurance claim never received, so I never had them replaced. It was almost just as well, since last year's students were about proficient with the 6th- and 7th-grade texts, and nobody would clarify for me just how I could get my hands on the grade-level stuff, anyway.

My students this year are similar, but since somebody has finally told me how to put out a call, I did so, and the high school teachers caught wind; my entire lunch period, and a good fifteen minutes after school were spent listening to the high school teachers berate me for not having done this last year, especially with the students I had (admittedly some of the higher-ability kids in the school), and question my decision to even pursue getting the materials for the kids I have this year, who are ""idiots"".

Reported to the principal, as he had advised me to do after incidents last year. Nothing happened, and I don't expect that it will. This is a minor incident in comparison to the past year."
highschoolteachers,"Give them something to get them moving and using energy in a positive way. Also, candy. Middle school and high school kids love smarties and dum-dums and they're cheap. If they ask how old you are, be elusive... just say ""old""... 22 doesn't seem like a big gap, but it's worlds away if you make it seem like it! Also, and I know I'll get a lot of disagreement from some for this, but you are just a sub. Be consistent, do the lesson, and don't leave a mess for the regular teacher, but don't feel like you need to be over the top amazing. I'm not saying be bad, but don't bust your ass too much, especially if you make mistakes or have off days. You can do all that once you get your first position. This is a good time to develop your behavior management skills, get used to working with a variety of kids, and build your resume and connections. I say that as someone who subbed for a year, just my opinion."
highschoolteachers,"I got my MAT before going into teaching (I had a BA in History but needed the certification and figured that if I was taking the classes to get certified, I might as well get my Masters and be paid more). I lost count of the number of people who told me districts wouldn't hire a new teacher with a Masters. Not sure how the rumor got started (perhaps some jaded people looking for a reason why they weren't hired) but in my experience, the people who do the hiring (principles, department heads, etc.) have absolutely no interest in trying to save money by hiring someone with less experience. It doesn't even factor into the equation. The Board of Ed is responsible for coming up with a budget. Now, if it was a very small district, with low resources, I could see it possibly making a difference, but the majority of district budgets are in the millions. The extra 2 k that they pay a teacher with a Masters is a drop in the bucket. They spend more in an hour than the extra salary they would have to pay you.

That being said, since you are already going to school for education (I'm assuming that your program is a certification based program), you might be better off finding a job first and letting the district pay for your continuing education. Also, a new teacher in English has very few opportunities of landing a high school job (job saturation). You might have to teach middle school for a few years first. I'm not saying it's impossible, more like improbable. If you have the right connection, you might very well end up in a high school. Best of luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Hi, thanks very much for your input.

The preparation that TFA provides is my biggest concern atm. I'm fairly confident in my ability to prepare and teach a subject....but like someone else on here said, there's more to teaching than that. 


I answered your first Q in another reply:
As far as being a new teacher goes, I'm a non-traditional student right now, I'll be 29 when I get my bachelor's. I had taken a few years off of studying to work, surprisingly, in academia (oh how I love the irony). Anyhow, I have several years of tutoring experience with elementary and middle school kids, and 2 years as an instructor w/ one of the big test-prep companies teaching LSAT and GMAT to college students and adults. It's some classroom management experience, although I know it's not the same as teaching, especially not in one of the poorer performing districts. And yes, ideally I would teach high school but I wouldn't mind having a middle school classroom.

As far as disadvantaged youths- I had a few as tutoring students, and I would say they struggled far more than their peers, even in basic language skills. It always took more work on my part to understand the particular motivation and needs of an underprivileged kid and they tended to require more support and guidance from me. So, it's tougher over all.

I guess my question to you, then, is how do your TFA colleagues compare to your traditional-teacher colleagues when it comes to that first year in the classroom? Are all first year teachers equally idealistic and unprepared, or do you feel that TFA does a better/worse job in this aspect?

"
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the feedback, it's great to hear from a TFA alum. And thanks especially for those book recommendations. I hear you about how difficult it would be, and that seems to be the consensus on here.

Given this, do you think that the TFA training will still be sub-par in terms of preparing me for a classroom? I would hate to think that I was being useful but actually end up harming my students :/ Also, could you elaborate on what the biggest problems you faced with your students were? Is it motivation or behavioral or both?

Edit to add: thank you for being comprehensive in your reply!"
highschoolteachers,"I was in almost the exact same position as you in the fall of 2012. I was graduating the next spring with a BA in English and I had actually submitted the application and was about to go through the interview process when I withdrew. 

Here's why: 
1. I realized the main reason I was doing it was because it was a guaranteed safety net after graduation, and then I realized that that is not a great reason. 

2. I was doing it because many of my other friends in the humanities were doing it, probably for the safety net reason. 

3. These things made me doubt, and then I started googling TFA stories and that's what changed my mind. The horrible, morally and emotionally, situations these TFAers were writing about made me very, very anxious.

I'm now in an education program where I'll have my license to teach high school English next December and then it will only take me 18 more credit hours after that for my master's. 

Also, I have a very good friend who did two internships with TFA before she actually became a TFA teacher, and she said she wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 

And here it is bluntly: I feel much more confident in myself and in my future career knowing I have spent 2.5 years learning how to be a teacher rather than 5 weeks. "
highschoolteachers,"Here's something better than advice: contact a local high school and volunteer your services as a guest speaker or substitute teach. No amount of advice is the same as actually being in a classroom with 25-30 kids. Do not even think about making a transition to teaching high school or getting your certification until you have taught for at least several months as a substitute. Then, and only then, will you begin to have an idea of what teaching is like and you can make an informed decision."
highschoolteachers,"I'm new to teaching too and one thing I've learnt is that there is nothing black and I white about it.  
It sounds like you are just struggling with your classroom Management and if you can get a handle on that you will be just fine.  The kids need the structure and routine as much as you do.  

You seem to have supportive administration and that is a big benefit, you obviously aren't comfortable with the idea of quitting so I would hang in there so you don't regret it.  You may never go back of if you get out now.  

$1000 is low but if you worked full time it would more than double to my knowledge but then again,  I don't know any teachers who got into teaching for the salary. Retail has more earning potential but brings it's own stresses and it's very competitive.  

My best advice would be to spend a lesson with your classes and work together to come up with a list of classroom expectations and consequences for each.  Let the students participate so that they understand the process and the rules of your class.  Don't be too strict.  They know they can push you and will get away with it so anything you decide on Will require 100%follow through.  
Whatever you decide though,  be clear and consistent.  
Also,  in high school,  be honest.  Tell the kids that it's clearly not working for you or them and that you want to spend the lesson working out the best way forward. 

The next lesson,  implement these rules,  follow through with the consequences and get administration involved at the start if you need them so you feel like you have some weight behind your words and actions.  Once the kids understand exactly what you want and what is and isn't acceptable they will have no excuse to misbehave and if they do they will understand what the result will be.  

Without classroom managenent you can't do anything in the classroom.  It is undoubtedly the most difficult part of teaching because no matter how nice or good you might be,  if you can't get them to listen,  you can't get them to learn.  

Don't give up, kids, schools and classrooms are different.  If you are still unhappy at the end of the school year,  move schools before you walk away for good.  

Hope it helps,  just  my 2cents .  

Good luck

highschoolteachers,"I completely agree that your first priority needs to be your own health and sanity. You need to take care of yourself - and only you know what you can handle.

That being said, when I was in 10th grade, my inner-city, poverty-stricken high school hired a new choir teacher, a short petite white woman who was homeschooled before college. She had the WORST first year ever, with wayyyyy too many students being incredibly disrespectful and just plain rude to her. But she managed to get through it. For some reason, she decided to come back the next year, and the year after that. By the end of her 3rd year, she was one of the most well-loved teachers in the school. So IF you do decide to stick things out (and again, DON'T do that if your health is at risk), know that it will get better as time goes on.

Also, if you do decide to stick things out, remember to make time in your schedule for YOU outside of teaching. Find people who can support you and remind you that you are a great person, regardless of how shitty of a day you're having. Take the time to watch a movie in the evening once you're prepared for the next day and put school out of your mind. You've gotta take care of you, both for your own sake and to be a great teacher."
highschoolteachers,"I love teaching. Your experience will depend a lot on where you teach and your personality. As a geologist, if you want to do high school you need to decide if you want to do earth science, biology, chem, or physics. Most places you'll easily get a job after you get a credential, 1 year in many places. Salary depends a lot on location. Teaching starts anywhere between low 30's to high 50's. In my district you make $100k after 12 years and high school science is an easier job to get. 

Also, don't listen to people who talk about how you can't teach how you want. We have standards, but teaching still allows for a lot of creativity and autonomy in most districts. "
highschoolteachers,"Substitute teaching is a nice foot in the door. I have been subbing for 2 years while finishing up certification for high school science emphasis biology. It has been great experience and I appreciate getting to teach different subjects at different levels every day. Though I am excited at the prospect of having my own classroom. Pro tip- learn students names quickly. I use a seating chart and that helps after a bit you don't need it anymore. I enjoy teaching you should definitely give it a shot if you feel it's something you would appreciate, it can be very rewarding. "
highschoolteachers,"I honestly don't understand why there are schools or districts that don't allow rewarding good behavior. But maybe the rewards are why the schools that I sub in have such well behaved students. They have something to work toward each day. I definitely stand by the systems that we have. And only because they have been proven to work. I also sub in local high schools. And I have had numerous students there tell me that they wish their school had reward systems. Whether it be for behavior, attendance, or consistently turning in homework. The students want to know that they are working toward something other than staying out of trouble. This is why I have started carrying a goody bag filled with suckers, peppermints, jolly ranchers, and the likes. My high school students will monitor themselves as far as noise level and behavior. And I don't have to remind or ask them near as often to quiet down or consider their actions. They will tell each other to whisper or stop talking when they begin to get too loud. A lot of students will even add on that it is because they want the rewards that they know are coming at the end of class if they behave/ don't lose talking privileges as a class. (I have a three warning system. I allow talking, but the noise level must stay at a minimum. If I have to raise my voice to be heard, they are too loud. They get three warnings. At the third warning, they lose talking privileges.)"
highschoolteachers,"I don't know what year you're in but when you're starting to look into colleges, find schools that have 5 year combined BA+MA(T) programs. Unless you specifically want to be an elementary school teacher, I advise against elementary education, and unless all you want to work with for the rest of your life is special ed (SPED) kids or move your way up to admin (not a bad deal) also avoid pigeonholing yourself into SPED. 

Teaching is becoming more and more competitive so your best bet is to always to be a star candidate with the proper certifications coming in and with a substantial educational background. There are counties that pay very well and produce top notch students and those require a masters for their teachers at a minimum.  

As mentioned elsewhere, your best bet is a major + teacher cert to get you started (can be done in 4 years). The major HAS to be a high school subject (such as english, biology, chemistry). Unless you minor in the subject you plan on teaching, it's actually difficult to meet the certification requirements outside of the major without having to take post-bac classes. I was told during a School of Education open house that the #1 reason why most people don't get the proper cert is that they don't have the proper coursework to even start certification in a specific subject. If you are interested in social studies, this is especially the case (no social studies major; history majors have to go back and take geography and other coursework to round out their education.) Work closely with an advisor to plan your career! 

Once you get certification as undergrad, it frees you up for what you can do for your masters. Most districts don't care what you do for your masters as long as you have one. The teacher cert masters are short enough, but you may be interested in other masters degrees other than teacher cert masters. If you choose to become an admin, you can get a MEd in educational administration, MEd in curiculum planning, MS in counseling (if you choose that instead), even a MBA if you decide to run a side business! Many of our teachers have full blown STEM and economy PhDs and just got certification tagged on via community college. 

This seems all overwhelming but once you get a hold of a career counselor (in your HS and in your future college) it becomes easy peasy. Contrary to popular belief, teaching is not dead end and there are so many options out there for teaching / teachers getting in and out of the field so always keep your eyes out for opportunities. 

If there's any advice to give: don't drop large sums of money for a teacher education, you will be sad. There are programs and scholarships that will pay for teacher education so there's little to no reason to be in 6 figure debt to become a teacher. Oh and do not pigeonhole yourself to your locale- anyone who is successful in life makes major sacrifices and push themselves far to make their life work. You may have to move to find a good position. In fact, if you like travel, I'd highly suggest trying to teach overseas in your 20s and try to pursue international/embassy, and military schools before settling for your community school because that's when you have the most flexibility. Peace Corps may be an option as well (I am acquainted with quite a few former peace corps volunteers.) "
highschoolteachers,"It is always great to see more people wanting to join the ranks of us teachers. When making the decision about whether or not to go into teaching I think there are a few questions you must ask yourself

1. Where do you want to teach? (urban, rural, suburban, alternative?) This question could also be asked in many different ways. Do I want to work at a school like the one that I went to? Do I want to save the world through education? There are different cultures among the students and staff in all of the different types of schools. I have worked in only urban schools, but one was neighborhood and the other charter. I've had a couple of friends move from urban to rural and encountered a different world out there. This question is important because it helps to inform how you start your path towards certification. If you want to save the world through education alt-cert programs are fine. If you want to work at a school similar to your own background then alt-cert may work, but only if you're from an urban area. Normal teaching certification gives you more choice once you have your certification. 
1. It appears that you're interested in an alt-cert program in Houston.  Are you sure that the schools there will allow you to grow into the teacher that you want to be? I know this is an odd question to ask so let me add some context from my own personal story. I accepted a position in an alternative teaching certification program in Chicago. Once through the summer program I got a job at a high school, teaching physics, with a population of students who had very low skills. Many of my students only met the mathematical, reading, and science standards for someone 6 years younger than them. Therefore I had an infinite amount of remediation that I had to perform in my classes. I was constantly going over reading and mathematics skills. After two years there I came to terms with the fact that I just didn't care to play catch up with my students skills. In order to be the teacher I wanted to be  needed to move to a school where I could teach my content primarily. When I first started out I figured I was ""strong"" enough to work in these under-served areas for my entire career. Two years later I'm still teaching, but at another school
1. What kind of teacher do you think you will be in terms of classroom management? Answering this question helps to inform where you should probably work. Personally I'm a nice guy. This doesn't really work to well to progress a classroom full of ""urban youths."" So I needed to learn to become an asshole. My guess is that my niceness could be more easily accepted by moving to different schools, aka the burbs. In my third year of teaching I moved to a charter school with a very strict but well thought out and communicated discipline policy. The school-wide discipline policy helped me to become a much better teacher and actually focus on making my instruction the best it could be. 
1. How comfortable communicating with parents do you anticipated you will be?  I actually hate calling parents, because it usually doesn't change a student's behavior. Also I'm required to have 7 successful parent contacts per week. This is a function of me working in the schools that I do. However I have heard that the parents at urban or highly successful schools can also be quite annoying and intrusive. Are you comfortable with either?

I hope these questions help you to identify if teaching is right for your, or maybe they help you identify the next steps you should take. 

Beyond the questions, I suggest observing some classrooms. Try to observe in a neighborhood school urban, rural, and suburban just to see the differences. To do so just e-mail or call the principal of these schools stating that you're interested in teaching and that you would like to do some observations before going into it. Principals really do like showing off their schools even to people like you. Pay careful attention to the halls during passing periods, there is a lot to learn about the culture of the school by watching students as they move around.  I did this, and really enjoyed it.  

Good Luck"
highschoolteachers,"That sounds terrible! 

I work in a county where teachers are clamoring to work here so much so many become subs as an intermediate before landing a full-time position. If anyone's asked to cover someone else's class, it's a sub giving up a free period (we're contracted to cover 6/7 periods). My SO's school barely ever has a class left uncovered. 

I actually have a hard time finding jobs as a sub even though last year I was doing it full time (sans benefits) and this year I'm doing it 3/5 days. I only get hired about ~4x a week last year factoring all the holidays and PD days. I actually have the luxury to pick and choose a little more because I don't have anyone to support and my SO makes enough so I don't have to pay rent or utilities. 

The only jobs I see having a hard time getting picked up are half day assignments and elementary school jobs. There are significantly more elementary school teachers than high school not to mention elementary school can be a major turn off to subs. It's a lot more work and less break time not to mention because children are so touchy feely adult men feel uncomfortable around small children. Even I, a 24 yo female, feel a little weirded out because some kids don't know what wrong touching is and they'll just grab at you or bury their head in your thighs to cry!!! "
highschoolteachers,"I'm student teaching in a school that uses a lot of responsive classroom activities for morning meetings, etc. This was something we did a couple weeks ago in third grade, but I feel like it would be good through middle and high school too.

Call two students to the front of the class. Student A has one minute to make Student B laugh. Student A can use jokes, make faces, and so on. Student A cannot touch Student B, so no tickling or anything. 

If Student A makes Student B laugh, B returns to their seat, and Student A gets another minute to make another classmate laugh. If Student B does not laugh, Student A sits down, and it's Student B's turn to make another student laugh.

You might not get through the whole class the first time you do this (I don't know your time constraints), but this is a good way to start a class and get everyone into a better mood."
highschoolteachers,"Not a teacher (yet) just a sub but I was in a somewhat similar situation except I was in retail.  I thought I wanted to teach so I tried tutoring for a government contracted program, loved the kids hated the program. I went into subbing and it has definitely solidified my desire to teach.  But I'm elementary so subbing is a lot closer to teaching than high school subbing (so I've heard) so YMMV when it comes to subbing.  I'll be starting my credential in January though.  Good luck, hope you find what you love."
highschoolteachers,"I was referring to the link to give you more information on the comics themselves. I purchased all of mine at the grocery store and had physical copies of books. Apologies that my post wasn't that clear.

The comic itself started in the 40s and follows a high school teenage boy, Archie, and his friends. I felt that it was age appropriate given the level you're looking for for reading experience while being somewhat relatable since your students are about that age. "
highschoolteachers,"I practiced law for five years (still ""Of Counsel"" at a small firm) but started teaching last summer.

My wife had a job opportunity out of state and asked what I would do. I said, ""Well, I can get reciprocity for my legal license..."" She said, ""Wait, you hate your job don't you?"" I didn't know she knew that. So... I joined Teach For America.

As part of my contract, I am getting my Master's of Science in Teaching while teaching math and science to high school students who are currently incarcerated. I love my job.

TFA has many pros and many cons. In my opinion, career changers do better. I also manipulated my placement to make sure I was in a school that has trouble finding teachers. I don't want a job that could go to someone more qualified.

That being said, depending on placement area, you could be in a charter that expects 7am-8pm workdays and Saturday PDs. You can't say ""no"" to an offer of employment.

Anyhow, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Pro: It's Columbus Day -- no work."
highschoolteachers,"Oh my gosh this is mind blowing! **7.30** starts at high school?! **8** for elementary?! *(I would have struggled so much with high school starting that early!)*

In NZ it's pretty much similar throughout the country (with exceptions here and there of course) Most high schools start at 8.30/9 and finish around 3/3.15 with 2 breaks - half an hour morning tea and between 40-50 minutes of lunch. These breaks are free for students to play sports, hang out etc. 

At primary and intermediate (our elementary and middle) most schools start at 9 and finish at 3. Again 2 breaks but most schools give 45minutes to an hour for lunch break. This usually starts with 10/15 minutes sit down eating at the start of lunch and then free time outside. (With teachers on duty of course.) Most schools have play grounds, fields, sports equipment etc. which students choose where/what to play. Most schools also have cultural group/music/dance/sport meetings at lunch for students to join at this time too.

Lots of primary schools also have 10-20 minutes of fitness everyday (on top of 1+ PE lessons a week.) And if my class is getting a bit restless (or particular students) it is not a big deal to send them outside for a quick run around the field or something similar. 

Our ratings are pretty good internationally and we are a very multicultural society. "
highschoolteachers,"I am responding to your updated cover letter.

Point 1: No contractions in formal letters like this, e.g. I've, don't, shouldn't.  Spell it out.  Yes, it varies per district and person, but spelling out the entire contraction never got any eyebrow raises than someone who used a contraction.

Point 2: Put your name and contact information in the header above the district's address, similar to how you have it in your resume.  If not that (which I recommend), put your contact information (email, number) at the end.  Make this process as easy for them as possible.  Flipping pages is a pain when you're doing it 500 times.

Point 3: (Trying not to offend the poster who said this but...) NO TO THE PHOTO SUGGESTION.  Please, for the love of teaching, do not do this.  It'll make you stand out for all the wrong reasons.  They can easily discriminate based off of appearance if you do this as well.  It's the same reason why you do not include your age or birth date on a resume.  Why can Dan Meyer get away with it?  Because he's Dan Meyer. 

Point 4: No generic cover letters.  Your revisions don't indicate that you have a spot where you are going to talk about the district or school's mission statement or beliefs.  Do not send out the same cover letter to different schools.  You can have a slot where you will change the wording; there's a high chance that most districts have similar statements anyway.

I'll be brutally honest: The issue with your cover letter is that it's all just a lot of fluff.  You literally have not told me anything unique about yourself that sets you apart from others.   This varies QUITE a bit with districts, but if I was reading a cover letter with a bunch of quotes and quasi-analyses of said quotes, I would be thinking, ""This person has absolutely nothing substantial to say."" If you feel the need to explicitly tell me how you feel and not what you did, you either do not have anything important to say (which obviously is not true based on your resume) or have no idea how to say it.

I mean, you love working with kids?  That's really nothing new. Every teacher you're up against does -- or will damn pretend it at the least.  You're going to help students with technology?  Well, duh.  That's the way education is going.  You HAVE to do that anyway.  What TYPE of technology are you going to implement that will benefit the district and its students? 

&gt; Just like anything in life, a good support is needed in order to succeed.  Education is one of the biggest building blocks to life.  Students now no longer just understand the material but also get excited to learn.

You told me nothing to make me believe that you are capable of doing this.  If you tell me WHAT you did to make students feel excited to learn, then everything you said above is implied.  Hell, you wouldn't even NEED the above quote.  I, your reader, would know by implication.

&gt; Your cover letter needs to hook them so they hopefully look at your resume (and this is if you've made it past their online application filter process). Talking about what is already on your resume doesn't do this.

I noticed you took out most of the information on your resume in your cover letter because of this comment, but you are misunderstanding what this poster meant.  Your resume covers the basics of what you did to prepare yourself; your cover letter is used to expand on a particular set of incidents that will demonstrate to future employees why you are going to be a benefit.  For example, my resume may state that I have worked in a middle school for x amount of years and helped pilot the 1-to-1 iPad implementation in my school, but my cover letter says that my students did a project in order to prepare them for the upcoming SBAC and state-wide tests that use iPads and computers.  I told them that I was asked quite a bit to demonstrate iPad applications at staff meetings.  I told them that having a teacher who is comfortable with iPads is beneficial because their students will need to be comfortable with technology anyway when they head to university or trade school or employment after high school.  You need more concrete, real views and ideas in your cover letter.  What you are saying you are going to do is much, much harder to prove.

While you do not need to follow this formula, perhaps this will frame your thinking a bit more:

* Par 1: The position you are interested in, a comment about the school's mission statement (I noticed with _____ that your district values ...) and why your experiences match those values. Pick one value or quality you have yourself (use of technology, etc.) and have that as your focal point to guide the rest of your letter.

* Par 2-3: Preparation.  What did you do to match this value the school holds highly?  How is what you did going to actually benefit the school and its students whether presently or in the near future?

* Par 4: A bit on your philosophy or what you see your students doing or what they are capable of (the answer to this is capable of anything so long as they have clear and high expectations).  How will your teaching philosophy benefit your students and the world they will be living in?

* Par 5: Wrap up.  Repeat what position you are interested in and your contact information."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school in Texas. Children who attend public school in Texas must have at least 7.5 hours of school each day. Some districts have slightly longer times, but that's not typical. The start and end times for each school are set by the individual districts, but generally have staggered times due to buses. My district has high school from 7:30-3:00, elementary from 8:00-3:30, and middle from 8:30-4:00. 

In Texas, teachers by law must have a minimum of 450 minutes of student-free planning time every 2 weeks, in blocks of no less than 45 minutes. We are also to have a 30-minute duty-free lunch daily.

At the high school, the students don't get ""breaks"" unless you count the time between classes as a break. My school has 8-block scheduling, with 6-period days, so they get 5 ""breaks""."
highschoolteachers,"I can fill you in on what floirda does. In most schools here, students have 6 hour days and teachers have 7.5 hour days.  I'm working in special ed at a title 1 school (very low socioeconomic) and I have a an hour planning period in the morning, 30 minute lunch break, and an hour break at the end of the day while the students are at specials. Most middle schools and high schools have 6 periods (4 core and 2 elective)."
highschoolteachers,"CC is NOT just standards....I have no real problem with the standards but I am going to copy past a past post of mine bc there are some good points about cc in it.

I did my home work….and here are the key points:
Standardized testing is changing due to Common Core standards.
Thus the curriculum is being geared towed these tests.
Colleges DO care about ACT and SAT scores.
The experts seem to think that these standards won’t prepare students for college.
Employers may not care how you did on these standardized test but they do care if you graduated college with a particular degree.
Meanwhile your students testing data and personal information will collected by private corporations who promise to keep it secure.
Watch me justify my ""misinformation and ranting"" with total disregard to how I organize the content.
1. Ambassadorship: From the Department of Education’s site, learn why the PAF program exists: “principals should have meaningful opportunities to both contribute to and understand the [federal] policies” —“to implement needed reforms, all stakeholders… must understand the intent of [federal] policy…” —“PAF’s will spend time gaining greater knowledge of the content of key federal programs and policies…” — “Principal Ambassador Fellows (PAF) are hired.. to facilitate cooperation between the Federal Government and the non-Federal entity…”
So, a federal employee is going to take political policy and private corporation interests and use it to ""implement reform"" in public schools. However, I am sure they only care about maximizing your tax dollars and students education.
2. Sex ed standards: “By the end of 2nd grade, students should be able to: Use proper names for body parts, including male and female anatomy.”
On page 14 it says: “By the end of 5th grade, students should be able to: Describe male and female reproductive systems including body parts and their functions. Identify medically-accurate information about female and male reproductive anatomy. Define sexual orientation as the romantic attraction of an individual to someone of the same gender or a different gender.”
On page 9 under “Guiding Values and Principles” “Instruction by qualified sexuality education teachers is essential for student achievement.”
Wouldn’t that be the parents? Who decides who is “qualified”?
“Students need opportunities to engage in cooperative and active (lol funny word choise) learning strategies, and sufficient time must be allocated for students to practice (bow chia-wow wow) skills relating to sexuality education.”
What does that mean? I guess it dosnt really matter I am a fox news puppet and I clearly didnt read the standards. Ohh wait, I'm not a puppet and I just quoted the standards that are already being taught to some 7 year olds aka 2nd grade.
And I just have to highlight this principle: Students need multiple opportunities and a variety of assessment strategies to determine their achievement of the sexuality education standards and performance.
**3. Results of standardized: ** tests are used for high-stakes decisions, ranging from which schools to close to which students to hold back a grade to which teachers to fire.
I hope little Timmy tests well today because his future and the futures of his teacher and administrators are counting on it.
4.The ACT: most widely known for the college admissions test of the same name, which is launching its Aspire testing system in the spring of 2014. Aspire will include a suite of yearly tests in English, math, reading, science, and writing in grades 3-10 that is being billed as linked to the ACT exam (and ACT’s college-readiness standards) and aligned to the Common Core.
I have already been discredited so who cares what I think right! Well the ACT publishers seem to think that standardized testing has an impact on future employment; probably because you can’t accomplish jack in academia if you can’t get into college. But what if you do.....
5.What the experts say about the standards themselfs:
""With the exception of a few standards in trigonometry, the math standards END after Algebra II, reported Stanford emeritus professor James Milgram (Milgram was also an official member of the Common Core validation committee.)
Both Milgram and Stotsky refused to sign off on the academic quality of the national standards, and made public their explanation and criticism of the final version of Common Core’s standards.
At a March 2010 meeting of the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, Jason Zimba, a lead writer, told the board that the standards are “not only not for STEM, they are also not for selective colleges.”
Stotsky explains: “U.S. government data show that only one out of every 50 prospective STEM majors who begin their undergraduate math coursework at the precalculus level or lower will earn bachelor’s degrees in a STEM area. Moreover, students whose last high school mathematics course was Algebra II or lower have less than a 40 percent chance of earning any kind of four-year college degree.”
Dr. Stotsky also notes that there are “other consequences to over 46 states having a college readiness test with low expectations.” The U.S. Department of Education’s competitive grant program, Race to the Top, required states to place students who have been admitted by their public colleges and universities into credit-bearing (non-remedial) mathematics (and English) courses if they have passed a Common Core–based “college readiness” test. Stotsky writes: “Selective public colleges and universities will likely have to lower the level of their introductory math courses to avoid unacceptably high failure rates.”
Stotsky says, “It is still astonishing that over 46 boards of education adopted Common Core’s standards—usually at the recommendation of their commissioner of education and department of education staff—without asking the faculty who teach mathematics and English at their own higher education institutions (and in their own high schools) to do an analysis of Common Core’s definition of college readiness… Who could be better judges of college readiness?”
Well, I might not be an expert on the standards or how they will be reflected on standardized testing but Dr. Stotsky and Milgram are. Sooooo....it looks like the guy who did the math to get rockets to the moon and the lady who is the leading expert at language arts standards are on my side of the argument to some extent.
6. Data Dat Data In 2010, the National Center for Education Statistics released a technical brief about “Guidance for Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS),” which formulated a detailed plan for “data stewardship” in education. The SLDS created a grant program in 2005, each grant lasting three to five years at up to $20 million per grantee. In 2012, a combination of 24 states and territories struck a deal to implement data mining to receive grants. “Personally Identifiable Information” will be extracted from each student, which will include the following data: parents’ names, address, Social Security Number, date of birth, place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. On the other hand, according to the SLDS brief, “Sensitive Information” will also be extracted, which delves into the intimate details of students’ lives:
Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or parent;
Mental and psychological problems of the student or the student’s family;
Sex behavior or attitudes;
Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, and demeaning behavior;
Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships;
Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers;
Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or the student’s parent; or
Income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such program).
It is unclear whether students will be required to answer the aforementioned questions while being analyzed by the four kinds of “sensors” promoted by the DOE report, but all students will be subjected to questioning. Although the SLDS claims that this particular information “requires written parental consent” before a minor is forced to disclose it, loopholes still exist that could circumvent parental authority.
I am sure that this information wont be compromised or abused in any way because we all know ""that is not the purpose of standardized testing"".
 I hope this will encourage you to go educate yourselves on the topic of high stakes testing and the monopolization of public schools."
highschoolteachers,"So much this.  

This is why I wish PE were a mandatory core class ALL years of schooling. Not just team sports, but things like aerobics or martial arts and swimming and running.  Combine that with cooking classes at the middle/high school level and finances &amp; money classes and we might have healthy, well rounded graduates who can take care of themselves as well as ones that will go on to be doctors and rocket scientists and market managers. 

The longer I teach (high school), the less I want to cram in just because it's on the list...and just to get them to find things they enjoy reading or at least discuss honestly. "
highschoolteachers,"There is backstabbing. It can be very political. You are but a number to them and not really a person in many cases. It's always about the bottom line and if they can save money by getting rid of you, they will. I've seen people lose their jobs at 55 years old and those people can't get back on their feet because ageism is a real thing. 70 hour weeks are a common thing these days and so are two weeks of vacation where you are also expected to be hooked up to work the entire time. Then there's the reality of what you're doing that sets in. In my case it was yelling at teams of people for not having impossible projects done with unrealistic expectations. I just really got to the point where I couldn't be passionate about spreadsheets and I couldn't stand making other people miserable at the behest of management who had no clue how to actually perform the jobs of the people under them. Nepotism is a thing. Favoritism is a thing. Unfair treatment is a thing...and I've seen this across different companies. It exists everywhere. I am not saying that it doesn't happen in teaching too...but you are there for the kids at the end of the day. You aren't there to turn a profit with the fear of god beaten into you because the consequences of not doing so could mean your ass.

I didn't enjoy my job but it doesn't mean I wasn't good at it. How did I end up in the wrong job for 15 years? Easy. I went to college right after high school and made a decision. I moved my way up. It is generally easier to stay in a job if you are financially secure than to quit and take a risk. "
highschoolteachers,"I am also going to be a high school history teacher and to make myself a more attractive candidate, I decided to also take the biological science CSET. The skills between history and biology actually transfer well and the science credential will help you land a job. If science isn't your thing, go for math. Either way, one of the STEM positions in addition to your SS cred will help.Be willing to lead a club as well."
highschoolteachers,"It is shocking sometimes how little kids know about even ""basic"" history, or the questions they will ask.  I teach African Canadian Studies to a grade 11 class in a high school (obviously in Canada) where almost 100% of the kids in the school are either immigrants or first generation Canadians of Middle Eastern/African heritage (religious school).  Yesterday, while teaching about the early slave trade in the 700s, a student raised his hand and asked ""when are we going to learn about Morgan Freeman?""  I had to almost walk out of the room I was so dumbfounded haha.  It can also be incredibly rewarding when you see students take an interest in a historical era or event.  I also teach English and while talking about the Victorians I mentioned corsetry -- a group of girls (grade 12) all came to me today to ask me more about it and asked me to bring in some historical fashion books I have, so that was kind of cool. "
highschoolteachers,"We had one of those assemblies at my high school when I was still there... 7 years ago, I think? Glad to see the message stuck. -_-'"
highschoolteachers,"Cell phones are so deeply integrated into the life of a teenager that I'm struggling to find an appropriate analogue from my own youth. I think that absolutely nothing compares. Banning them wholesale from high school is not only unenforceable, it's utterly wrong. "
highschoolteachers,"They recently graduated high school compared to all those old folks close to retirement.   However their English teacher failed to pass along the message that wording things to try and make yourself sound ""smarter"" often has the exact opposite effect.  Just say what you're trying to say! "
highschoolteachers,I teach at a juvenile corrections facility and would love to be try something like this. My kids are all male high school aged. They are in my program for committing crimes and are currently going through a rehabilitation process. Pm me if you are interested. I teach 6-12 ELA Btw. 
highschoolteachers,"In the middle of year 11. Really great high school science career to this point. Never had your issue, but if I did I wouldn't even think twice about it, unless there was a hazard involved. 

I love that you jump immediately to assuming I'm not a teacher because I asked a simple (and, I would suggest, obvious) question. Sorry if it doesn't fit your management narrative. Good luck dealing with this issue. "
highschoolteachers,"Yesterday, I told the (high school) students that I couldn't hold a study session after school because I had meetings with some parents. One student said ""You have meetings?"" I replied, ""Yeah, with your mom.""

The whole room just lost it. I was completely unaware of what I said until the words came out. Woah boy. His mom didn't mention a thing about it at conferences that night. Safe for another day."
highschoolteachers,"Student taught and have done most of my subbing in high schools. The kinds of high schools in which mild swearing is common place. ""Ass"" is perfectly normal and commonplace. ""Shit"" is contextually tolerated, and ""Fuck"" is not allowed.

First time in a middle school the kids were grilling me on what kind of cool things I could do with chemistry, so of course I say I know how to make TNT and I draw what the molecule looks like on the board real quick and there like ""ooooooh"" and ""ahhhhh"" and I just off the cuff say ""Yup, I'm a bit of a bad ass."" and the look of shock on their faces was just priceless."
highschoolteachers,"My freshman year of high school I was able to mess around with some of the new technology my Geometry teacher had access to. It made things like writing on the whiteboard able to be saved as a image and shared online so we as students could go back and see exactly how each example problem was taught.

Technology is both a blessing and a curse. I hope to see technology classroom within 5 years or less, but we have to be able to control students to not go all willy-nilly with the tech we give them."
highschoolteachers,That's what I miss about teaching high school =/
highschoolteachers,Do you think these would work as a high school level bill bye? Www.wtfisx.com I was involves in making them so any criticism is welcomed!
highschoolteachers,I'm working on making some Bill Nye style content for high school level - what do you think?  Www.wtfisx.com
highschoolteachers,"As a high school math teacher, I would also be delighted to help elementary school teachers understand the concepts behind the methods they are teaching."
highschoolteachers,"Sincere question, do you have experience teaching in these schools? Have you worked as a teacher in an under performing low ses school?

Because I have and let me tell you, three years of full time classroom teacher in the lowest performing high school in my county made me realize the solutions aren't easy and the situation can be damn near impossible. TFA isn't perfect and it's commodifying teaching in the worst possible way, all brushed with the glossy paint of Ivy League prestige. I'm not a fan. I have met Wendy Kopp and she's so out of touch in her ivory tower it's ridiculous.

But this isn't a one dimensional issue.

&gt;Millions upon millions are being thrown at TFA by major corporations instead of being thrown to the schools that could hire veteran teachers and improve all aspects of their impoverished schools.

Look let's be real. No veteran teacher is going to the hood. NONE. The teachers in these schools are young, idealistic, scrappy and willing to give their all for their job. They're first year teachers and take this job because all the cushy suburban ones are taken. They work and work until they bleed and burn out, then leave the profession all together. Veteran teachers 10 years from retirement aren't going to move to a difficult  teaching scenario no matter how good the pay is. 

Case in point, I had a colleague who got a $250,000 grant from the state to teach science for 5 years in a struggling high school because he had some of the best test scores in his other district. He was getting an extra $50k a year on top of his salary of $70k. All he has to do was stay here and survive, then move back to his original district. He quit after two years and forfeited his grant. He even paid it BACK. Why? Because the school killed his spirit, it absolutely destroyed him. He was smart, passionate, and very dedicated. He was an awesome teacher, I went to his PDs myself. Unfortunately he was wholly unprepared for this job for a number of reasons that was no reflection on his teaching skills or motivation. He told me he nearly got a divorce while working with us, which is no reflection on us or the kids but the sheer draining quality of being in this day in and day out.

It's because teaching in the inner city is HARD. You can't teach. You're so passionate and you want to do well and help these kids, but so many factors come into play. Social issues in the community, racial tension between teachers and students, the culture of schooling at large. It's little wonder people dedicate their lives to understanding and finding the answer, and no one has it yet.

And I say bullshit to those who say ""just care, just love, just work."" Fuck that. I cannot name one person at my school who didn't want the kids to succeed, from the principal down to the secretary. My school was a united  team to build these students to success, and we still failed. It wasn't due to lack of talent, passion, effort or even support. It was because the infinite factors beyond our control overtook many of our efforts.

I'm not a TFA fan and I agree with you that too much money is given to TFA programs and veteran teachers are pushed out in pretty shading hiring dealings. However, money and financial incentives for teachers aren't the answer. Community building, outside support and a solution against generational poverty is the first step to building a successful educational system, not administration support or teacher training. 

&gt;Ohhhh, so if they have the money to attract veteran teachers, but fail to do so, there is *one* thing to blame: administration. Teachers are up to the challenge. The one thing that tears a teacher down is lack of support from administration. Experienced teachers have seen and handled it all. The one thing they won't put up with forever is a bad supervisor (which is what a principal essentially is). You can't handle hiking through Hell while hoisting the devil on your shoulders.

Teachers are NOT up to the challenge. I'm sick of this idealization of teacher motivation and the sainthood we all have to fit under. Look, teachers have lives, we need to do this long term. I lived in my classroom for three years and I gave my all to these kids. I can honestly say I did everything and I had a great principal on top of it all, I have no complaints on the support I received up top and I can honestly look back and not question an iota of my effort.

Yet I still quit. I moved to a suburban district with more pay and less stress. I did it because I was having problems in my personal life that my dedication to teaching was creating, and I needed to make a decision. Because it's unrealistic for any human being to ask anyone else to give up work-life balance for the sake of a losing battle. Being in a hopeless situation, working tirelessly to keep from drowning while struggling every day not to lose the faith or your sense of direction is spiritually crippling.

&gt;And they're only asked to serve 2 years, assuring they never become experienced, unlike a traditional teacher with proper training who started teaching that first year with the expectation of making teaching his or her career. No school needs or deserves temps, let alone our neediest schools. 

I went the traditional route, got my master's degree from an Ivy League university, published research on poverty in the Bronx with an acclaimed professor, had two years classroom experience when I decided to move into inner city and I got my ass handed to me my first year. I nearly died. Nothing can prepare you for this teaching scenario, nothing. It's really baptism by fire and very few teachers competent and educated with options survive for longer than five years. When I left after year 3, only four teachers at the school had been there longer than me. FOUR. Out of a staff of 40. The turn over was a travesty and so depressing, but I didn't blame the teachers in the least. One teacher tried to commit suicide over winter break one year and her husband had to come in and quit for her.

TFA won't do any better and their lack of preparation is a total sham for the kids going into it. But hell, I did horrible my first year, the only thing that sustained me was my sheer stubbornness.

Inner city isn't a joke. I loved my kids, miss them terribly and harbor so much guilt for leaving them. I had really great successes and horrible failures. I think about my quitting all the time and I do feel it was a personal failure on my part. 

Sorry for the long rant and I went off on crazy tangents that you'll probably pick apart and negate, but I just want to say as someone who thinks Wendy Kopp has no idea what she's talking about and who thinks TFA is a flawed system, I give credit to the efforts they put into trying something, at the very least. Society is poison and educational systems are just a reflection of that. I don't think TFA is the solution but I hardly think it's the problem. I go through periods of being hyper critical and mildly disapproving of them since a lot of my friends went through it (TFA was big at my grad school), but at the end of the day our system is broken and some solution is needed. TFA is not poison, it's an imperfect promise packaged as a marketing scheme for the misinformed seduced by prestige. But I've met tons of passionate, smart and dedicated individuals that graduated from the program. I've also met idiots, but that's true for all jobs.

**WAY TL;DR** Inner city teaching is hard, TFA won't prepare you but then again nothing will. Teacher emo angst."
highschoolteachers,The thing is unless you deal with math as an adult and teach it to others it is difficult to come up with this on your own. If my kids knew how to build the elementary math it would make middle school and high school math so much easier for them.
highschoolteachers,"As a high school math teacher I love the common core. In elementary I know it is harder to teach this way because you have so many other things to prepare for your day (I admire you so much). However, when they get to me they have no foundation and they don't understand why they are subtracting 9 on both sides of the equation. It benefits everybody if we stop with the ""rules"" and ""magic math"" and teach real math... They desperately need to know the why. I refuse to give my kids rules to do the math, they would be memorizing all day everyday. 

Please, if you need help with how to teach math conceptually ask a high school teacher or a middle school teacher with a strong math background. It can only help."
highschoolteachers,"You should look into international schools- to be cruelly frank to all the Public school smucks and smurfs out there - yes it is true they are in entry level dead end jobs - it used to be they could claim only a university graduate could do their job - now with the TALK program which takes 20 year old gap year kids- even that claim is not always true... with an international school you could advance in pay and I would guess position all the way up to maybe principal... with a Korean public teacher school job you are NOT a legal teacher in Korea - rather you are a teaching assistant - you will never advance past that position and your pay after 3 years will hit a ceiling of about 2,300 -2,500 and never advance further. As in life a teaching in general - if you are all about helping the kids and excited and eager to make a positive change for the Love than a yeartoyear contract a dead end state should not bother you- plenty of altruistic join the peace corps which is definitely less cash and posh than here....

 I suppose you could argue you could be such and outstanding professional that you will be taken from the school and put in the district office as the native English teacher coordinator - but even this job is a year-to-year contract position and a dead end... of course you could do a year or two in a Korean public school (though you would be put in an elementary school not a secondary one - jr and high schools axed like 95 percent of their western teachers due to budget cuts) and then use that experience to go to an international school in Kroea or another nation - but as a rule ESL in korea is for 24-29 year old kids who graduated with a business major, ended up as assistant managers at Kenny Shoes, and quit their job to be the happy monkey peculiarity in a Korean school.... if you are eager to do team co-teaching, get into Korean culture, and do not mind a short 1 year contract where the teacher you replace may have been a skating slouch 26 year old that will tarnish the korean teachers' view of you then get a public school job... 

I dont think International school teachers make so much in korea anyhow maybe like 2,600- 2900 a month if there is a phat cat international pro teacher making 3grand + a year in korea please brag on and bust me down..."
highschoolteachers,"I began tutoring math in my area expecting high school math to be the most requested. To my surprise, I have far more 3rd and 4th grade students as clients than any other grade because their parents see the extra steps and assume it's too difficult for the kids to learn, which really hasn't been the case. I've ended up teaching more to the parents than working with the kids in many sessions. 

To see  what all the fuss was about, I worked through the math books they are using in class. The steps seem excessive but it amazed me how much my math skills improved. To have had those skills before I took my basic math, algebra, calculus classes in high school  and discrete math, number theory, and linear equations classes in college would have eased my anxiety an immeasurable amount. The number sense that is being taught is in no way wasted on these kids. I'm a strong supporter of all of the new strategies being taught in response to common core. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a similar situation with a student who was also permitted to wear hats for a different medical reason. I work at a high school that has a big problem with students wearing hats in the halls, etc. I just told the students it was none of their business. They dropped it after a day or so. Don't stress over it! "
highschoolteachers,I deal with a lot of students in high school who were never taught a method like this and frankly aren't smart enough to figure it out.
highschoolteachers,"Just because it's been explained doesn't mean it's not ridiculous. If you want to get into the ""conceptual"" part of math do it in high school and college. Do not force these children to be confused, frustrated, and turned away from math because of this crap."
highschoolteachers,"What I'd highly recommend to you is to consider exactly what kind of teacher you want to be. If you're truly set on being a high school bio teacher, then do it up. I have to say that when I was a student I respected a teacher who had some ""real world experience"" in their field of teaching.

One thing I'd suggest you look into is what I do; environmental education. It's often nontraditional style, where you actually take the students outside every day, every class, basically no matter the weather (kind of like a field biologist). You're teaching the same basic concepts oftentimes, but in a far more hands-on manner, which was absolutely amazing for me after working hard to become a field researcher in college.

Because, just as you said, it's often a lot of long and lonely hours in the field. Whereas now I run around in the woods/streams/ponds/beaches with a big group of students, teaching them about everything from inverts to challenging yourself.

Can't ask for much more.

Source: Went to school for field research, graduated and became a teacher."
highschoolteachers,"There are 4 levels at my high school:

Standard: these are remedial kids usually and sometimes lazy on-target kids who request it or on-target kids who have a weakness in a particular subject area/too much other stuff going on. 

Honors: these are mostly on-target kids (a few below with parents who force them into Honors and a few above who just can't handle a full pre-AP or IB schedule and selected an honors level course). 

Pre-AP/AP (I teach English so 9th/10th are pre-AP preparing them for the two AP English courses): Above grade level, at least in that subject area. 

IB: Above grade level, often gifted/talented, and are taking the full IB schedule. 

I currently teach Standard and pre-AP. In Standard, I give 0-30 minutes of homework weekly (planning for everu minute in the classroom to be utilized, so some kids do more at home if they miss time in class or don't focus and work or need additional time) and often there is time built into class to do homework if you stay on task 100% (this is the time built in to accommodate for the difficulty of squeezing every single minute, bell-to-bell out of Standard kids... it's really not easy to do this). Most of the time homework is just ""finish this thing"" or a small review activity. 

Pre-AP Honors: They do a ton of reading at home, write essays at home, etc, lots of prep activities for the in-class stuff, because this is 10th and next year is AP. And AP is serious business. "
highschoolteachers,"First of all.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  For not being part of the anti-homework movement.  I teach high school algebra and there is no substitute for a good homework ethic. 

Second.  I saw a teacher use a bit if pvc tubing and a couple of 90 degree elbows to make a hand set like on an old style telephone.  This way a student can whisper into one end and hear it without bothering the other students. "
highschoolteachers,"The point of homework is practice.  That said, I don't think that practice necessarily needs to be done at home.  

I teach high school math at a school with block schedules, so each class period is pretty long.  I typically devote half of each block to a guided lesson, and the other half to independent practice.  I am always available to answer questions and such if students have issues with the practice.  If a student doesn't finish their work for the day in class they are allowed to take it home, but that is never my intent when I am making the assignment.  I prefer that a student be able to finish comfortably before the class ends.  

So far, I've found the strategy to work well.  I teach in a title 1 school and have pass rates on the state test that are well above average, so I think my strategy is working fine.  "
highschoolteachers,"No problem. 

I see what you're saying, but I'm going to offer a slightly different perspective. Feel free to take this all with a grain of salt because it's completely unsolicited. My undergrad is in physics, and I'm working on certification. It looks like we may have a somewhat similar background there (The only difference is that I got to skip out on student teaching because I was hired straight out of college with no teaching credentials. My current full-time teaching job is counting for that in my state). Moving from a primarily upper-level university environment to high school was a major culture shock for me. The direction in which high school physics instruction is headed is drastically different from the way we learned it in high school and college.

I spent SO MUCH TIME during my first year trying to make useful summary handouts and to emulate my college professors And I got horrendously frustrated. The vast majority of the time, they ended up lost, wadded up in the floor, or in the recycle bin, and the kids hadn't really absorbed enough for a summary to be useful anyway. We're a Google school, but even before then, my students--even the laziest ones--were and are much more inclined to check online than to keep up with paper anything. I post a brief summary of all of our plans for the week (like, really brief. Think: ""Discuss Types of Thermodynamic Processes"" or ""LAB: Finding the Speed of Sound in a Closed-Ended Air Column"" or ""Rotational Motion Problem Set #1 due Thursday) and all of the problem sets and examples that we plan to do for the entire chapter in advance, so if my kids miss a day (or just aren't mentally present in class), they know what to look for. Solutions are posted after class. Anything beyond that point is on the student to come and discuss with me.

Also, don't write off the text as completely horrendous just yet. Yes, the one I had my first year was the worst book I've ever seen in my life, but I had input into the adoption of a new one. Many of the evaluation copies from recent editions of certain texts are actually pretty impressive. I love the one I'm currently using for general physics. I'm not going to give publishing companies free advertising, so if you want to know which ones I find decent, PM me or something. AP still does better with OpenStax, though."
highschoolteachers,"The thing with charter schools is that every charter school is different. There are some great ones and some terrible ones.

I haven't worked in a charter school, but I attended two different ones, one for middle school and one for high school. They were both great schools. High achieving and high expectations, and thus they tended to have nicer better behaved kids than the students in public schools nearby that didn't want to deal with the high academic demand. That being said, I'm pretty sure teachers at both charter schools made significantly less than they could have at the nearby public schools and they were not part of a union."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school English teacher in a department that expects a certain amount of novels to be read and papers to be written, I just don't have the time to get it done in the school day. 


Is like to move to a system of 5 minutes of practice for homework, or just developing a question for the next class. It's just as a teacher who will find herself at a new school next year, again, I don't want to piss off my department or admin."
highschoolteachers,"I'm leaving after my 1st year because 22 is not old enough to be teaching insane high schoolers. Also I want my debt paid off sooner. Also I want to find a school where I'm not the only ENL teacher. 

I'll be going into the Army, which has always seemed like an untraceable goal. I'll be able to keep up my certifications, and get licensed in other states as well. 

Eventually I will return, but probably not to an urban school for awhile. I love my kids, but the American ones make me contemplate my existence daily. "
highschoolteachers,"At first I wasn't sure why, but once I saw music I instantly knew why: that's the problem. 

My high school (literally) has more English teachers than all of the high school music teachers in the district combined.

My best advice is to start at the bottom. We've all been there. My first full year I took a job at a crappy school that nobody wanted to teach at (due to the admin-not the students), but it got my foot in the door so I transferred the following year to the school I'm still at now. You're going to have to put in your time like we all do."
highschoolteachers,"I've heard that it's a lot easier to transfer from California out to other states because of all the stuff they make you do here. You might find [this](http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/cl560c.pdf) helpful. 

Basically, you won't be able to teach at a public school without a Single Subject credential. There's no Economics credential so I'm guessing it would fall under Social Science (?). You will probably want to double check on that.  

You need to complete a student teaching placement and coursework to get your credential - along with other things like a basic skills test and subject test etc. I've heard that skills test can be transferred if your state has a similar one. After you are done with that, you're issued a preliminary credential which you have to clear within 5 years. That's done through a few more years of working with a mentor teacher, being observed etc. Basically student teaching again but you will have your own classroom. So getting a credential in CA is pretty difficult which is why it's hard to transfer it in. But I would also call a county office of education and talk to their credential department because they might be able to clarify what hoops you can skip over if you are trying to transfer a certificate. 

For private schools, you may not need a credential. A lot of them prefer one but it's not required by law and I know some around here need teachers and will hire - especially if you studied that particular area during college. 

Also, I'm pretty sure economics is required in California high school for one semester. It might be hard finding a job if you are *only* willing to teach economics. But if you are open to APs or government/civics and other areas then that might help.
"
highschoolteachers,"That sounds interesting! My high school offered CTE classes so I'm a little familiar with how it works. Does that require a different degree, or is it still just a straight education degree?"
highschoolteachers,"I don't teach in this subject area, but my initial thought was that these students probably got these ideas about Islam from their parents. I have worked in some ethnically diverse schools and rarely saw any racism amongst students. One high school I taught at had several female students wearing hijabs and from what I saw, the other students never made any comments about it (but again specifying that's just what I saw, I have no idea what their school experience is like when there are no teachers around). "
highschoolteachers,"If they truly believe it and aren't just acting out then don't try to force them to change their belief.  This will solidify it and make it you against them.  Honestly Islam is a religion and like all religions contains both non-violent and violent aspects.  Even zen buddhism had sects that would pillage and plunder towns.  

Let them have their opinion but say that just like you have to provide facts for your information, they have to provide it for theirs.  Make sure to talk with the entire class at some point about sources and how to spot good ones from bad ones.  

Hell you could even have them make opinion papers with ASSIGNED VIEWS!  don't just give everyone "" islam is great"" to write about either.  Make everyone choose an opinion they don't necessarily believe in and then have a debate with it.  It makes  those 3 not feel left out, teaches everyone the valuable skill of critically thinking about information and playing devil's advocate and can be a fairly fun experience.  

I remember when i was in high school we had a mock trial and my got someone that was known to be innocent convicted.  Great skill development, showed something very interesting about human nature, and honestly fun.  "
highschoolteachers,"Thank you!
Yes I've definitely seen that 7th graders are pretty awful compared to 6/8... unfortunately no chance of switching. I'm pretty much the only non-vet math teacher (2 teachers per grade here). I have been thinking of going back to high school, I did my student teaching there.
And I agree... while the teachers are helpful, there is only 1 other 7th grade math teacher and he is making up curriculum as we go, too. The district adapted new curriculum just this year. That is another reason I want to leave, I need much more curriculum support."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; other students started teaming up telling me how much they dislike me and how bad im doing. 

What the fuck is this shit? Were all of your kids raised in crack houses? I'm going to tell you something, as a substitute who has worked in some ghetto-ass places, their opinions of your performance don't fucking matter. They're children even if they're in high school physics. 

Not saying you should totally tune them out but you need to be able to discriminate between a ""Mr. so-and-so I really need help with this. I don't understand you're lesson even though I'm trying"" and ""hey, I just don't like you bro and I'm trying to get under your skin."" 

Lastly, if you're credential program is anything like mine was then they're probably teaching you that any failure in your students is your fault. It's not. Some kids are fuck-ups and will remain fuck-ups until they change their attitudes. You cannot change their attitudes with more ""universal design for learning"" or ""meeting your students at their level"" so you shouldn't feel responsible for that. Remember, that the professors in your credential program have a job to do and in many cases that's push fluffy bunnies shit and conformity. 

As long as your mentor is cool with what you're doing and you think it is best based on your own professional judgement then you're okay. 

&gt; What can I do? Both now to get through, and what can I look to after? 

As for this part, I really can't help you there. I don't know much about Pennsylvania but one thing you should look up is the requirements to keep your license and reinstate your license. You don't know, maybe you'll find yourself years down the road with teaching as your only option to keep a roof over your head. In that case you would be damn happy you kept that license up. 

That said, if Pennsylvania is anything like California then you might just want to quit now.  "
highschoolteachers,"You basically just summed up my experience with my co-op teacher. I would get excellent scores from my university supervisor, but since I didn't do the lessons exactly as my co-op teacher did it she would get annoyed with me. She even pulled the ""you're just starting out and I've been doing this for years...you have no idea what you're doing!"" card. Very frustrating. 

If anything, take the opportunity to look at the lesson itself as a learning experience. Why did the lesson not go as planned? Is there anything that you could have done differently? Why do you think the students did not understand the content? If your co-op teacher won't appreciate the lesson, you at least owe it to yourself to reflect on the situation and problem solve for the future.

Also (and this is just a side note), I would definitely inquire to your co-op teacher as to why they're about to graduate high school without any formal training in essay writing...this is an essential skill, and your co-op teacher definitely should have laid down that foundation. Just saying."
highschoolteachers,"I had a kid start cursing me out today because I wouldn't let him leave the room and just go wherever (I am actually surprised he didn't walk out, but I think he's in danger of getting kicked off his team and was hoping to avoid a worse referral? I didn't write him up yet because I want to talk to him tomorrow, as the behavior was erratic and seemed triggered by something and I want the full story first -- there will be *a* consequence but what consequence, I have to talk to him to see). 

I addressed the fact that he could not leave, instructed him on the behavior I expected and the consequences, and then moved on and kept teaching ignoring the rest of his rant. It's things like this that really make the kids think you're serious about teaching, I feel -- I'm not going to waste 24 other kids time to get into a rant with a teenager. It just doesn't even factor in. 

The key is to never take anything personally but still issue consequences and take everything seriously. The distinction between ""seriously"" and ""personally"" is simple: Is it about the work? I am very serious about the work. Everything serves the work, including me. The work of learning is what we're here for. My own personal feelings are pretty irrelevant to that. I was in teacher mode, so the kid cursing me out honestly didn't even factor in on a personal level. It was all about assessing how I could best move on with the class. How did I get that way? I don't know. More than half a decade of Title 1 middle school probably didn't hurt -- you get numb to being cursed out after awhile, I guess? When I have to make an actual ""mad voice"" (because it's all some kids respond to, honestly), I have to pretend usually. I just don't get angry feelings from what the kids do 99% of the time. The 1% I do is if I actually see a kid doing something sociopathic and/or intentionally dangerous to other kids (or once, to an animal, as I saw a kid torturing a squirrel). 

For the record, I teach high school. If a 10 year old started cursing me out, I might have to address it differently just because all the other 10 year olds would be more confused/distracted by it. "
highschoolteachers,"As a math teacher in high school, every single day. Most of the time I have at least one answer but some days it has to be ""this will teach you how to think critically""."
highschoolteachers,"If you're not willing to take on the student load of teaching (at any level) then it's better to go a different route. Teaching in a school setting comes with a lot of rewards, but also a lot of stress, paperwork, etc. It's not for everyone, not even a good portion of teachers.

Have you tried looking into community ed programs around you? Most large enough school districts offer evening and/or weekend community ed courses.  Often they are open to ideas from the community too, if they don't offer a pottery class already. If the local high school has a pottery studio it would likely be held there, but with adults who want to be there/pay to be there so more of the atmosphere you're looking for. Could be a great way to get a start/some experience in the teaching side of what you want to do before setting up your own workshop! Usually they don't pay much as it's one or two nights a week, but a great way to dip your toes in. "
highschoolteachers,"Ok. Been there. When kids get whiny, it's not a big deal. There's always a tomorrow.

As far as hand holding, it is true that most students prefer outrageously clear instructions, step by steps, graphic organizers, and whatnot. So that advice is sound. Just because you or I were writing analytical essays in seventh grade, doesn't mean all kids do. You don't have all the information of what these kids have learned in the last 13 years. Is the school or district different than the one you went to? Are the kids from a different socioeconomic strata? Taking the recession into account? Are there a lot of ESL students? Special needs students? How is curriculum different from when you were a kid? What about the school day, is there an equal number or hours devoted to ELA? What about critical thinking? Are teachers paid less, relatively, than when you were a high schooler? How many hours a day were you using a device then compared to kids today? Times change, man.

Part of being a, well, adult, is getting along with coworkers and supervisors. Or pretending to. Geez even when you own your own business, you can't pick your clients and even if you pick your employees, you still have to pretend to like them more than you do. Don't take your cooperating teachers comments personally. Most of them have a student teacher because they want to share what they know, not because they are bossy assholes desperate for the tiny stipend.

Go ahead and have that drink. At a later time, Rewrite a lesson plan for hand holding kids into analyzing a thing of their choice OR using a graphic organizer to write a simpler essay type (opinion, maybe). Best of luck :)"
highschoolteachers,"umm.... occasionally.

I do a pretty good job of connecting the ""content"" with real life.  My philosophy on learning history in high school is that students need to learn the skills necessary to become effective citizens.  

We don't study history in order to learn a bunch of dead white guys' names and dates.  We learn it in order to make sense of our own world, to understand how the systems and institutions that affect our lives developed and, perhaps most importantly, how to change them for the better.  I like to tell my kids that it doesn't matter what the founding fathers wanted; instead, it is up to us, as the people of the U.S., to ""establish a more perfect union"" that is representative of our needs, wants and dreams.  But in order to effect change, we must understand the foundations and traditions that we have developed in our society. 

Therefore, I always try to show how something from the past is analogous today.  This is pretty easy to do in U.S. History as we're always rehashing the same issues.  (We're currently talking about the Great Depression and the New Deal - the role of government in stimulating the economy is as important in the 1930s as it is today.)  It's harder in World Studies, but I do my best to make it ""meaningful"" even if it's not ""real life."""
highschoolteachers,The requirements for subs vary by district but a lot of places just require you to have a high school diploma and pass a background check and maybe a basic interview. Many districts hire subs year round because they don't have enough.
highschoolteachers,"If you mean teaching high school pottery, you would need to get a general art ed degree. There's not specific licensure for pottery (unless some state has a weird system). 

Art ed is pretty flooded, a lot of people want to teach it but most schools don't have many art teachers. You have to be willing to take long term sub positions, part time, etc for awhile more than likely. 

Elementary ed has more positions, but can be pretty competitive in some markets.

Honestly, can you do both? Having more than one licensure can be super beneficial in that you are open to a wider range of possibilities and can switch between them if the opportunity comes up. Districts like it too.

You may find that once you start your training you much prefer one path or age group over another, it's not uncommon for teachers to switch their plans as a result of a field experience!

If money means anything to you, you will likely make more running high school pottery than a community ed sort of thing. Doesn't mean you couldn't run an outside workshop too, but it's good to have that option!"
highschoolteachers,"It sounds like this environment is toxic if seniors in high school have never written an analysis essay. That should be a skill developed since middle school English.

Play along, get your passing grade, and never return to that place."
highschoolteachers,"The state funding can count for a lot.  In my district, the union has negotiated class sizes with the district.  The district can overload classes, but they have to pay more each time.  Eventually it gets cheaper to hire another teacher, which is the point.

Also, depending on the state, the school district gets a certain amount of money per FTE student.  They have to use that money, plus whatever they get from federal and state sources, to cover all the bills.

The superintendent and business manager create the budget, which is approved by a locally elected board of directors.

The principals have a building budget, which includes the money for each teacher in the building.

Counselors do the actual scheduling and try to help kids take classes they need to graduate, as well as ones that will help them meet their post high school goals.

Teachers have little to no say, and neither do students."
highschoolteachers,"So I teach secondary science. I write my curriculum first, then make sure I've hit all the state standards second. Unless you teach a course that is part of a standardized assessment, the state standards are the bare minimum. For the most part, those standards are somewhat good, somewhat bad. 

For example, in my state for the chemistry standard there was no mention of the mole at ALL for about 6 years. From 99 to 2005. It has since then been rectified, but in exchange they dropped redox. During those dark times of no moles, I still taught what the mole was (I was still mistified how they expected us to teach stoichiometry without the mole) and also redox. Now we don't have to teach redox (According to the standards) but I still teach it. 

Sorry, rambling, but just trying to communicate that the standards are suggestions, not the be-all-and-end-all. But I teach high school, it is different for elementary."
highschoolteachers,I teach high school algebra.  I try to keep classes around 20 students per class but they usually go to 25.  Honors classes can go larger.  I hope that helps
highschoolteachers,"Lollipops.  I teach high school Algebra.  If they get an A on a test or if they catch me making a mistake on the board, they get a lollipop.  

It works"
highschoolteachers,"Your situation sounds exactly like mine.  New high school, new middle school, but our school is getting renovations.  We are being told it is a technology renovation... whatever that means.  We will be getting 300 more students in our Title I school.  We can probably take about 100 more.  No idea where the other students will go."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;I'm currently undergoing training to become a secondary science teacher and right now we're discussing state standards and how they apply to curriculum development. (In general, I get the impression of ""create curriculum and find a way to align it later."") 

That's the opposite of what standards and standards-based teaching should do. I hate when teachers just make stuff they like and say how it fits (I teach English, and this is a real problem in both English and Elementary school IME with both because a lot of teachers want to do ""fun projects"" with little real value or just read the stories/texts they like because they always have or whatever). I'm a big fan of standards-based teaching. Not ""kill and drill"" testing or anything, but the actual concept of teaching from a framework of meaningful standards, rather than just shoehorning what you think goes and pretending it aligns later. 

&gt;One of the points the teacher made is that all of her students are expected to meet the same criteria despite a vast age difference (anywhere from 5-7 years old), and the standards are not developmentally appropriate.

Are you talking about the Core specifically? People say this, but for the most part, the standards are developmentally reasonable for the lowest age of students in a grade (this gets iffier when you consider how middle and high schools force the on-target kids to accelerate math and is a little iffy in 3rd/4th grade math as well, but it's not unreasonable accept the acceleration issues which are unrelated to CCSS). The ELA standards are developmentally reasonable throughout. I taught Kindergarten overseas and wanted to teach it in America until I observed classes. Kindergarten teachers don't teach rigorously enough here, by far, for me. This has probably gotten better with Core? (This was awhile ago. I'm happily settled in high school now.) At least I hope it has gotten better. Too much circle time, construction paper stuff with no purpose (I love project based learning, but only when it starts with the standards), friends time, etc, and it didn't really feel like a workplace to me. I think a lot of people don't realize what 5-7 year olds can do if you push them. They should go observe classrooms in more countries to see just how much small children can do in many places where they're trusted to engage intelligently. This is why we fall behind.

Obviously, students need differentiation, but it's not necessarily just an age thing. One student may be ESE and need to be identified (especially in the primary grades -- they don't have help/skills yet or even a diagnosis usually). Another student may struggle with particular subject matter. Different students will develop different cognitive and even motor skills at different times, as they mature (no 2 children are the same). Some students are ESOL and need help with language. Some students are having rougher times emotionally. Some students came with more vocabulary and their parents spoke to them more, so they know more words. That's not about age though. Making it into ""A 5 year old can't do X"" is done far too often. The problem is the resources the teachers are given are often not up to the task (or the teacher doesn't understand how to differentiate and scaffold), not that the tasks aren't appropriate for the kids. Things like 40 kids in a room, a kid who throws chairs but admin never deals with him, parents who don't answer the phone, a lack of planning time and materials, etc, are all big problems. But a lot of teachers fall back on what's easier because of it, and that's not a real societal solution. 

&gt;For those of you who teach in high school, do you still see differences among age groups? Or have students pretty much evened out by that point?

Does that teacher have a mixed grade level class? I'm wondering why would 7 year olds be in Kinder routinely or 5 year olds in 2nd? I wouldn't expect that gap to start showing up until kids are old enough to be held back (usually after primary for sure). In HS, I have that kind of gap -- for example, I have a 10th grade Standard class with 11th grade repeaters in it too that has kids ranging 15-18, but it's still a 10th grade class. The ages don't matter much (older means further behind, of course, and those kids usually need more support, as they've already failed the class at least once). "
highschoolteachers,I always do student-led projects last quarter (high school). It's about the only way I can survive.
highschoolteachers,Would you mind sharing some of your resources? I'm very interested in this- I remember doing them in high school and would love to apply them to my high ability group in 4th grade (some of these kids are bored out of their skulls with curriculum). 
highschoolteachers,"The thing to remember is you might not use your degree in the specific field the degree is in, but it's an entryway into the tier of jobs gated with a degree as a requirement. There are jobs that require no education, then there is a tier of better-paying jobs that require a high school degree or GED, then an AA, then a bachelor's, etc.

Then there's the very un-capitalist idea that says the education is an end in itself, but that's a different subject."
highschoolteachers,"I teach in high school, so we don't have an end of the year test, but specific courses have End of Course exams, others have AP exams, and others have Milestones (state exams).  We also have a few others and courses will have mixes of those.

I believe in elementary school there is a state exam given (state of Georgia).  "
highschoolteachers,"Going OT here, but my teacher education teaches 1-2 levels above the highest level you plan to teach in. So since I am going to be a junior high school math/science teacher, my uni lectures cover up to junior college syllabuses. 

This means I can answer any questions that are ""advanced"", I can plan individual assignments for gifted students, and I in general feel safer in the classroom setting.

Disclaimer: I don't really know how the American teacher education is. Norwegian (as I am) is (as of this fall) a Master's degree with regular uni lessons in didactics and chosen subjects, and with 4-7 weeks of student teaching each year."
highschoolteachers,"Canadian high school teacher here. I log about 45ish hours per week, excluding the two weeks around reporting periods. 
Broken down, that's 6 hours teaching  (I work 3/4 time) each day, with about 7-8 hours prep and marking time each week.
I teach French, English, and Social Studies for grades 10-12 students. "
highschoolteachers,"Blacks don't need you to join the fight about the use of the n word for us. We don't need you to speak for us and/or fight our battles, so don't go posting on reddit AS A NON BLACK PERSON about how blacks feel and how history should be taught according to your own narrow viewpoint through which you claim to represent us. Get real. You, and other crusaders like yourself are so concerned with minutiae such as n words in high school literature that you miss out on real issues affecting Black communities in the US that keep our neighborhoods uneducated and poor--unstable families, drugs, gun violence, poverty, obesity, etc. Idiotic posts like yours become fodder for the right to obfuscate the issues I've listed above. Knock it off. "
highschoolteachers,"My high school uses Google Classroom, and we're not 1:1. I used it for presentations, (sometimes) research, and end-of-semester portfolios. I would reserve the lab, students would get a short reminder about how to use it, and then they were off! I would have loved to use it for all daily work and all pre-project brainstorming, but that really wasn't feasible. One year I used it for critiques at the end of every project, but that became difficult with scheduling the lab."
highschoolteachers,"I was hired to start a new program that was like a high school skills/career skills/social-emotional learning class...


The parents were NOT a fan. They had divided students into cohorts, and I happened to have all of the cohorts of the high achieving kids. The parents thought the class was useless and I was hounded multiple times by parents accusing me of being unfair in grading their children. Most of my work was graded on whether students put any effort into it, so the kids who thought my class was useless (like their parents were instilling in them), didn't put any effort into considerate annotations for their readings or putting together projects that were all about them.


Needless to say, I was thrown under the bus and ended up moving out of the school half way through the year. The guy who had the non-high achievers ended up getting the shaft at the end of the year too. We were both new to the school and easy scape goats."
highschoolteachers,"I always worry about my students who are doing well and then they seem to falter.  Now I don't teach high school, so I don't see as many students as a high school teacher sees, so I first try to find out from the student if there is something going on outside of school that is affecting their performance.  There usually is because I teach elementary.  It amazes me that parents don't think that what happens at home doesn't effect school.  I like if they tell me because then I can support the student in quiet ways. 
Now as a high school student in AP class who admits they are having trouble studying, it is on you.  If you need extra help go talk to your teacher.  I know my own children did AP classes and their teachers always worried about their progress.  The teachers hosted extra study sessions, so if they failed it wasn't on the teacher.  You had to be motivated to take AP and doing well on the tests pays off.  One of my own was a sophomore in college after one quarter because of his AP classes. They gave him a great foundation.  That saved us a lot of money. 
Now get off reddit and go study. "
highschoolteachers,"Depends where you live. I'm in California. My degree is in Sociology, but California requires all teachers to do a 5th year credential program. For me, it was elementary education. For you, if you were in California, a high school Japanese or economics teacher would need to complete a single subject credential program in the subject and pass some CSET exams in the subject (you could bypass CSETs by majoring in the content, but that doesn't apply to you since you're asking about the bachelor's degree itself). Check your state's education website for more information on how you should proceed."
highschoolteachers,"Engage your students in authentic discussions about how the scripture you're teaching connects to their lives -- that's the point of religious education, isn't it? By the time kids are in high school, they can make the connection between the parables and their own behavior, can understand how the Bible influences current and historical events, etc. Lead them in practical discussions and you'll engage their intrinsic motivation to talk about themselves and connect with peers. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm on the fence about moving schools. I would jump ship if it meant teaching high school again, but I'm hesitant because of my area's population decline and the political bullshit going on around public education. I just can't afford to be on the chopping block, and my current position lends a certain degree of job security in that I am my own department.  My husband and I just bought our first house, and there are only 3-4 desirable districts within a reasonable commuting distance. My current admin lacks a spine, and makes decisions that throw teachers under the bus. Our school culture is not great, and if not for my staff, I'd be scrambling to leave."
highschoolteachers,"When I taught high school, we did a cool color symbolism project with Gatsby. I also used to use it as a vehicle for understanding and dabbling in literary criticism."
highschoolteachers,It was the textbook I used all the way though elementary school and into high school. The same book. It's thorough enough for high school and basic enough for elementary. I'm looking at three copies on my bookshelf even as I type this. It's the closest thing to a definitive English grammar I've ever seen.
highschoolteachers,"My district has an extremely detailed ""Student Code of Conduct"" I couldn't possibly get into every infraction, but it's what you'd expect. 

At the school level, we have our own skipping policy, tardy policy, etc, and they work OK. I don't think you can ever really make a 100% effective skipping/tardy policy for high school students that keeps them from being late or skipping, but we do alright. 

I feel like my school is very simple compared to a lot of other places with their fancy systems:

* If a kid sells drugs, has sex on campus more than once (they get enrolled in a strict counseling program and put on a NO PASS list the first time), threatens or hits a staff member, brings weapons, makes deadly threats against other students (any threats against staff vs. serious threats against students)... it's pretty much automatic expulsion and things work out fine. Repeated theft, fighting, possession (they get enrolled in an addiction program the first time and put on a strict NO PASS list and agree to be searched daily) and documented bullying all get expulsions as well. My administration is pretty good at the paperwork, and the kids that shouldn't be here get tossed to the alternative system, as they should, where there are more restrictions and the structure suits their needs better to keep all students safe. 

* Less serious things like electronics violations, classroom disruption (repeated), cursing out teachers, skipping/tardies, etc, are all handled with In School Suspension (which is a joke, but that's not anyone's fault per se) and Administrative Detentions. The deans do a good job at trying to assign the kids the punishment they'd hate the most, but your repeat offenders in ISS make up like ~1-5% of our population and are what they are. There isn't a magic bullet. Removing them from classes so a) they cannot ""get lost"" midday because they're stuck in 1 room ALL day and b) they cannot disrupt or corrupt other kids is about the best anyone can do. I understand that. Admin tries to reach out to parents, find kids mentors, work with the kids, figure them out, etc, to their credit. But the free will is with the kid, and the kid has to want to change. My school has a lot of counseling programs and psychologists who come in as well, to deal with the stress of adolescence and mental health problems. We also have a Physician's Assistant and a Nurse Practitioner who can and do write prescriptions and treat medical issues FOR FREE. These two things help immensely and is something every school in the country should have. 

* Suspensions are mostly for fighting or other extreme behaviors that will eventually lead to expulsion if repeated or for kids awaiting expulsion hearings. My school is not a big fan of OSS and prefers to use ISS to make the kids at least come to school and be monitored. 

As to the teacher experience, they expect a fair amount of documentation from us. Some people are bothered by that, but I am not. We live in a litigious society. And if they're building a case for expulsion especially, there is a lot of paperwork the district/school board requires. Teachers have to do their bit. For smaller offenses, like issuing a tardy detention, we just have forms in triplicate and it's extremely easy. But when developing a case for why a kid needs a different class or setting, we have a lot of paperwork and documentation to do. 

There are no ""rewards"" at my school for doing what you're supposed to do (some class rewards, vary by teacher -- I don't really give any, but I do give kids privileges at various times, based on behaviors: i.e. you can go to the RR when needed as long as you always come back quickly/come to class on time/do your work, but that gets taken away if you're on my LIST; you can listen to music while doing X work, but only if you aren't trying to sneakily text/do something on your phone, you didn't have your phone out at an inappropriate time previously, you aren't behind on your work, AND the work is appearing on your screen, etc -- I don't consider these rewards but the natural result of the students building trust or mistrust and getting treated appropriately by me, as their manager). However, more recently, there is a positive behavior system for attendance (being to classes, on time, on a regular basis) because we've had a lot of absence issues lately, in addition to the normal skipping/tardies. They do small celebrations with snacks for the kids who've been in school or only had ""excused absences"" every day for the quarter and enter kids in raffles. It's nice and seems effective for 9th and 10th graders, though upperclassmen don't care (but it's new, so the current 10th graders might like it more as they age still, etc). 

For the most part, though, my admin agrees with me that a school discipline system is about rules and consequences, not some kind of carrot-style rewards. Kids are expected to do what they should be doing. Teachers aren't really questioned unless they deserve to be (i.e. you have discipline issues in every class and even with kids who never bother anyone else, and then they observe you and it's clear you're unreasonable). Admin takes our sides against parents and students regularly when we have proper documentation and are reasonable. 

Demographics: My school is the #1 ranked HS in the district, but not the richest. We are in a wealthy area, so people think our kids are rich but we're 35% free and reduced lunch (vs. many schools in the area which are less than 10%) and a lot of people don't know that. We have a very diverse population. However, we have a lot of super rich kids and they (their parents massive donations) and the fact that our local community is so proud of the school are a big reason my school has all the services and options we do. "
highschoolteachers,"Teaching first aid is tricky. Essentially to teach it without fear of being sued when someone messes up you have to become certified first aid teachers. This costs about $2000 a teacher. Buy all the materials and a few cpr dummies this costs about $500 each depending on quality. Than do the actual training which requires a lot of paperwork. Some schools can't afford the cost. It's a great skill to have , we do it at our school because we're medically focused. Also organic chemistry what school did you go to. I got maybe a short intro in high school but didn't get anything until I took it in college."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the suggestions. I sub across the spectrum from elementary to high school. Maybe a set of relevant lessons scaled for each range, rather than specific lessons for the subjects. "
highschoolteachers,"Same identical story at our high school. We switched to PBIS last year at our high. school. We also no longer suspend or do detentions...only a lunch detention. Train wreck and very, very frustrated teachers."
highschoolteachers,"I think the governor mistakes teachers as the parents of these students. As a high school teacher, it is most certainly not my job to find these students a job. I will set them up for success as much as I can, but after they take my class, it's often the last I see of them in a formal manner. 

It is important to note what jobs look for in the ever changing world. Now technology skills and teamwork skills are important and we incorporate that into our lessons. 

However I don't think I should know or care what jobs are available at any given moment. Not all students want to go to college, not all students want to be a business major just because Amazon has an opening. Also just because there are major openings in this field, will it be there in 4-8 years after the student goes through college? Funny how the economy and demands/needs change."
highschoolteachers,"I haven't experienced this with other teachers, but there are a lot of kids (10%+) who are gender non-conforming or trans at my school, so we've been through it a bunch.

What age group do you teach? I think middle school would be the worst in terms of challenging you with ""Why do you have long hair"", etc. The littles are pretty easily assuaged with ""This is the style I like the best, thanks!"" and high schoolers will probably figure out you're transitioning pretty quick if you start presenting at work. I do live in a very liberal part of the country, but in my high school the kids are *way* quicker than the staff to switch names and pronouns for other students who are reconsidering their identity. "
highschoolteachers,"Would this also apply to people who have experience outside education? I find it hilarious, in a gallows-humor sort of way, that I would be required to be a Walmart greeter or something despite having years of corporate experience and even small business experience from college and high school. 

Anyway teachers are usually not wholly or (sometimes) even very much responsible for choosing the skills that are taught, that is by the standards creators. Have the admin go mop floors if that's what you want, Kasich. "
highschoolteachers,"They lost me at the rant about standardized testing.

If it's done poorly or too often it is a problem.  And in many places that has happened.  However, people forget why standardized testing came about in the first place.  Teaching quality varied drastically from one school to the next.  Students were graduating that were borderline illiterate or couldn't work simple math problems.  Teachers in a given subject could teach whatever they wanted, however they wanted, without consequence.  That's how I ended up spending 2 weeks in middle school making a collection of pressed leaves for my science teacher.  

Standardized testing provides an objective metric by which to judge student progress between teachers and schools.  When done well it's actually highly effective, such as AP courses offered in high school.  Again, we should be seeking to do it properly instead of endlessly decrying it happening at all."
highschoolteachers,"Not sure if this is exactly what you're thinking of with this question but it's the first thing that came to mind for me.

I'm a first year high school science and my admin has been positive all year.  The closest thing to criticism I received for most of the year was my principal ""alerting"" me that he'd heard through the grapevine that there were some girls in my class that had apparently picked up on a slightly bias I had where if one of the girls in the group asked a question, I'd be sure to include the boys in the conversation but not vice versa.  When he brought it up to me, I realized that yea, I had been doing that and was able to pretty quickly discern why I'd developed the habit.  In the majority of my classes, when a girl at a table would ask a question, I had a maybe 50/50 chance the boys would pay attention to the answer, which of course often ended up with them asking the same question 5 minutes later.  If a boy asked a question, the girls were generally right there paying attention without any prompting.  So I'd started, almost unconsciously, preemptively redirecting the boys but not the girls.

Apparently the girls who'd noticed actually thought it was funny and had started having the guys at the table ask questions so they could laugh at it, rather than being offended by it.  However, needless to say, I've tried to correct this habit and I try to answer questions either much more ""individually"" or include the whole group on a much less ""gender-specific"" basis."
highschoolteachers,"I come across some female students from time to time obviously expecting special treatment when they smile and act friendly.  It must have worked for them before or they wouldn't be so confident about it.  I don't really blame them as much as the previous teachers that were sick enough to not notice they were being taken.  Needless to say it gets shut down pretty quick when they get treated the same as anyone else.
   
I'm a younger male, and I teach high school."
highschoolteachers,"I have a feeling you are a young teacher holding on to some residual issues with girls from your own school years. Let that shit go. I've taught poor, rural, public high school and private all girls high school. There is kindness and rot alike in every group and class. Change your mindset and expectations and people might pleasantly surprise you. "
highschoolteachers,"""Sure, their success might come in areas that don't require a college degree, but it's terrible to suggest reading the great works of literature should be considered some kind of luxury. And if it is a luxury right now, you can't just say that it's a reflection of the education system. You must be fair and say it's a reflection of the education system AND a capitalist society that has allowed inequality to fester.""

Certain people are not at an appropriate developmental stage to read Hamlet when they're 17 years old and truly appreciate its meaning. Every week we have English teachers on here complaining that half of their students aren't motivated to read the assignments, and even as a science teacher I'm privy to the fact over half of the regular students in even middle class suburbs are spark noting the assigned readings instead of actually analyzing the source material. They see no purpose behind the act. What is actually being accomplished by quizzing and testing students who would be better served pursuing their machines in the trades? I have numerous students who should not be taking physics but are excellent at reconstructing a car engine (which requires a different skill set of applied physics). 

I devoured classics like Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky in my early 20s, but I went through the motions in high school. 

""I'm the socialist I probably sound like, but I firmly believe that education shouldn't be subjected to market forces (like school choice and all that) because there are winners and losers in every market, like the top comment in this thread suggests.""

Let's not conjure up utopian alternatives. History reveals that there are winners and losers in all systems, but in the free market you at least get the luxury of choice, and competition promotes meritocracy to a much better degree than any other system attempted thus far. The alternative to school choice turns everyone into an educational serf except the upper middle class and rich. Vouchers also negate the concern about the poor being locked out of education because the public still subsidizes their children. In Texas, for example, families that make less than $70,000 will get an additional $1,000 if the pending legislation is passed. 

Yes, free markets are amoral, which is precisely why they can't be socially engineered by a small class of authoritarians. You don't have idiots like Rick Perry in control of a million students. I much prefer a free market to hoping that a benevolent bureaucrat  takes the reigns.

highschoolteachers,"Not terribly relevant, but I had a junior in high school who would punish himself by sitting in the corner. When I gave him the business for not focusing, he would hop in the corner and do his work there. Strangest thing, but it worked for the kid. "
highschoolteachers,In my 12th grade AP Lit class after every couple of books we would spend a class playing Taboo. It is one of my favorite high school memories. 
highschoolteachers,"Internally, I am still a 16-year-old shit-stirrer with a ""question authority"" bumper sticker about these sorts of things, but *I* would love to see him try to fight it. I don't know if you're in a position to go to bat for this kid -- are you new? how much of a rabble-rouser could you safely be? if you did, would your style be direct, like a conversation with admin, or indirect, like wearing your own pink shirt? Stuff to consider.

A related story: I went to a rural high school, and it was big news in my freshman year when a boy a few grades ahead (a friend of a friend, also a class clown type) came to school wearing a skirt one day, just because he felt like it. He refused to change, arguing that the skirt was long enough to meet the dress code and there was nothing in the school policy barring him from wearing it, and they issued him a one-day suspension. A few of his friends came to school with tutus over their pants to support him the day he was suspended (their tutus were confiscated), and once his suspension was served he walked into school the next day wearing a *different* skirt, only to be kicked out yet again. I don't remember exactly how it all played out (I know at one point he was required to come to the office before going to class to make sure he was dressed appropriately, which he did, then halfway through the day met his sister and switched his pants for her skirt in the bathroom), but his parents mostly stayed out of it (they were big hippie types that I think were encouraging him to ""fight the power"" on his own). The whole ""controversy"" made the school newspaper and I'm pretty sure the discussion escalated, maybe to the next school board meeting? In any event, he ultimately won the right to wear a skirt, although I don't remember if that was thanks to admin conceding to his points or just giving up. The interesting thing was that even though my school was very rural and very homphobic, because he was a good student and a well-liked (albeit silly) kid, it felt like almost all the students and many of the teachers were on board with his cause at the time.

In any case, I felt like it was a good example of somebody standing up for their rights and actually giving a shit about something, which I personally would love to see more often out of my students. Your student obviously has a way better platform than my old classmate (who I guess just woke up and said ""I'm gonna start some shit today""), and I think it's important that kids learn they don't always have to just accept whatever's handed down if it's wrong or unfair. "
highschoolteachers,"We are a PBIS high school. It honestly doesn't work. This is a wealthier neighborhood and there are no ""prizes"" or ""rewards"" that the kids care about. We had drawings for iPads and they didn't even care. If I was a taxpayer in that community I'd be mighty upset about tax dollars spent on that kind of thing. "
highschoolteachers,"Private religious high school. We run the gamut from scholarship students who sometimes don't know where their next meal is coming from to students who live in multimillion dollar houses. I hate our discipline policy. We have a pretty standard demerit system (though we don't call it that), and 4 write-ups lead to a Saturday school.

The problem is that the kids give zero fucks about getting written up because Saturday school happens only twice a quarter anyway. Also, our handbook is over 100 pages long and is so insanely specific and has been abused by ""letter of the law"" teachers/admin so much that our students feel empowered and even encouraged to challenge us to show them where their misbehavior was in the handbook when we write them up. It's the more privileged students that lead this, but then the other kids follow suit.

Other teachers bitch about how unevenly enforced the rules are, but it's hard to enforce rules that you can't even remember. And by the time you get done writing a student up, another one is causing problems."
highschoolteachers,"My high school looks like that.  Tons of kids falling english due to not reading and failing the daily reading quiz,  not turning in essays,  etc.   Have you done the pep talk of ""will you graduate if you fail this class?"" The quizzes and essay on this book are with 400 points. Do you want to take a zero on 400 points?  Are you going to pass with a zero out of 400?"" 

Fyi ,  one of the English teachers prepares 6 questions for the daily reading quiz. You never know what you will get. This helps to cut down on cheating by students telling others the question/ answer in later classes bc odds are,  they get a different question. "
highschoolteachers,"I hate the monthly drills so much I purposefully schedule my jobs at the other high school to avoid them. I've never not had at least 2 kids take off during as evac drill or some kid yell ""WE'RE ALL GETTING MURDERED"" during lockdown.  I just can't anymore until they give me a ""real"" job"
highschoolteachers,"In CA, we have a general science and a more specific credential.  We have to take two tests for general science, which will let you teach middle school science and qualify you for high school.  I also have a biology authorization, which lets me teach high school bio.  There's nothing wrong with the overlap - it just depends on how much more work you have to do in WA!

I wouldn't take math unless you REALLY want to teach math.  You'll probably pick up more jobs because you have it, but you'll be pulled mostly to teach math (instead of science) because of the shortage of math teachers. "
highschoolteachers,im in high school not 
highschoolteachers,"I can not testify to your state, but HS science teachers are in much higher demand than MS science teachers in my state. In my district they normally wont hire you unless you are a 6-12 science composite cert, just in case they have to move you from a middle school to a high school or vice versa. Sorry I cant be of more help."
highschoolteachers,i think the basics are essential. things start getting a bit haywire in middle school and especially in high school where you can tell a student is a bad fit for stem. 
highschoolteachers,"The schools in my area have a designated lead teacher. It's a resource for all teachers in the building  if they need help with instructional strategies. At the high school level,  It's a great tool - secondary ed degrees here tend to focus way more on content knowledge than pedagogy. The chemistry teacher across the hall from me knows the hell out of some science, but his kids have no idea what he's talking about cause he was never taught to teach. (Insert lead teacher). 

We can request she observe a lesson and try to troubleshoot; more often, she plans a visit to ""check in"" if a class has a lot of complaints or abnormal failure rate. 

Ours also heads the tier process and referrals for sped testing. She sits in every tst meeting. 

At my school, the job would easily keep 4 people busy 12 months a year."
highschoolteachers,"I was teaching English medical terms to prospective young nurses (16-18yrs) in an Asian country and we were reviewing how to ask an English-speaking patient where it hurts. Things were going fine until we came to the genital area. I gave them the technical terms (penis, vagina, buttocks) and one of the girls asked about a slang word she'd heard, ""cock."" I explained that in English there are a lot of slang terms for those areas. My co-teacher excitedly asked me to give as complete a list of terms as I could, so the nursing students would be informed.

Fifteen minutes later, already bright red from embarrassment, I was then asked to come up with a song to help them remember these terms as I typically did for organs and illnesses. 

I spent the next excruciating hour or so shakily singing an exhaustive list of below the belt terms to the tune of ABCs with a group of 45 utterly tickled pink high school girls, who proceeded to skip away from class in pairs singing ""penis, cock and tool and dick, johnson, wang, wiener and prick""."
highschoolteachers,"Almost none of my colleagues got Social Studies jobs in high school when we finished - a bunch did middle school, several were out of subject area - one got a special education position, e.g. Now, maybe four years out, more people have managed to move into subject area and/or grade level. 

If the only thing you're willing to teach in terms of age group and subject is high school Social Studies, and you don't want to spend time in middle school or doing English, then you may have a hard time getting the position you want. Plus, in California, Social Studies is fairly broadly defined: history, ancient to modern, world and US, psychology, geography, civics, economics and ethnic studies. With high school social studies, you have no guarantee that you won't get a subject that you're not very familiar with. When I did my student teaching, I almost got economics, which I really didn't want. LAUSD has passed something recently to push towards ethnic studies mandatory for high school graduation. 

If you eventually want to teach college, think really carefully about whether you want to do academia and research - because AFAIK that is what will determine if a four year school will hire you. Are you doing cutting edge research and writing grants and making them money? And if the answer is no, you just want to teach older students, Social Sciences at junior colleges are filled with PhDs who didn't make it in academia. Many of them these days don't have tenure and are stuck teaching at multiple schools without benefits as adjuncts. "
highschoolteachers,"""You're so full of it your eyes are brown.""

I teach high school, but still."
highschoolteachers,"Recently graduated student-teacher. When I needed everyone's attention, I started with a gentle, gradually quieting shush and slow arm movements, like a conductor of an orchestra letting the last note fade. It did not work. So I channeled my inner drum major(guy who leads a marching band, who I was my senior year of high school) and used a militaristic-sounding ""EYES FRONT!"" It was effective in quieting the class, but the sudden sharpness of the shout, which is part of its effectiveness, scared some students at the front of the class, and even startles my mentor teacher. 

Looking back at recordings of my teaching, it sounded uncomfortable when I wasn't saying it, but listening to myself. Later in the semester, my mentor teacher gave out cards to the students giving me some feedback while I was absent: Something I do well, and something I should improve on. Nobody said this to my face, but ""EYES FRONT"" was really poorly received. They HATED it. Near the end of student-teaching, I stopped it, and for the time being, used ""your attention up here, please."" It worked fine, but I want to try something else when I have my own classroom. I'm thinking that the students should collaborate to come up with it(with my approval, of course) so when I say it, there's no excuse whatsoever not to shut up. "
highschoolteachers,"Thanks a lot for the information. If it is challenging to find a job in a high school for social science, do you suggest this path? 
I am interested in social science and sociology. Eventually I would love to get my Phd and teach at the university, but I thought it would be faster to get my credential and teach at a school and later on go for my Phd. Do you have any suggestions?"
highschoolteachers,I worked corporate for 10 years before becoming a teacher. I teach Business &amp; Technology in high school - so that 10 years definitely counts as professional experience. It doesn’t just have to be teaching - depends on what you’re teaching I guess. 
highschoolteachers,"Amen to that!!!  

I teach high school algebra and the teachers that let kids use calculators are not doing them any favors.  They have no number sense.  They can’t do concrete operations so it’s next to impossible to get they to understand abstract concepts like variables.  "
highschoolteachers,"My husband works in the office of an auto auction, making around $15/hr and with over time was bringing home bigger pay checks. This was always a source for him to poke fun at me because I have a Bachelors degree, while he barely graduated high school. My salary at the time was around $38k or so. And I was at school 10 hours a day, plus some Sundays, to hang art and catch up. "
highschoolteachers,"Isn't it wonderful when you stumble upon something that just works for your students?  Now if only the same magic could work every time!

I've just been trying to figure out how to assess my students (high school) on the reading they completed over vacation without creating more grading for myself.  I like this performance idea!"
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, with high schoolers they are way too cool for school.  But it's Latin, and Latin kids are a little more nerdy so I might be able to make it work.

I don't have a Facebook or I'd check out the page, but I did take a look at the MARS/EARS approach a little on Google at least.  

If the kids don't want to chant, I completely get it remembering being that age, but I'd just really like to magically foster an environment where maybe 70% of the class will do it (and the non-participators will at least be exposed by listening).    Just hopeful thinking here."
highschoolteachers,"As I’m at a fairly high SES school, most parents tend to pursue this outside of the school system.  I also work at a high school so many are diagnosed before they reach us (though not all by any means).  

We do have RTI and are encouraged to use this if we see any issues.  I would say the biggest issue at my school/district is the response to mental health issues.  Though I sometimes think this is also a community issue in my immediate area as well.  Reputation and appearance are THE most important.

Thank you both for all the information.  😊"
highschoolteachers,"I'm licensed in Social Studies in California. I did a traditional one year credential path through a university. You need to take and pass the CBEST and all of the CSET Social Studies, in addition to whatever the university requires you to do - probably an early field requirement (spend time in a classroom) and then the usual university stuff - letters of recommendation, personal statement. 

You can try doing the internship path, but in my experience high school social studies is one of the hardest sub-fields to get a job in, so the internship path might not be possible. In my home district, they don't offer internships for Social Studies. "
highschoolteachers,"Good school districts have a licensed psychologist that handles diagnoses. Depending on the size of the district, the position is a part time contract, or a full time position. They will handle diagnoses, and often also provide some of the services to the students with higher needs.

A friend of mine has a private practice specializing in autistic children, but she has a contract with a local high school. She visits once a week to diagnose and offer services.

In Texas, I saw a paraprofessional diagnose dyslexia. Someone said ""just put it on the IEP, then we can pull them out of class more often."""
highschoolteachers,"I think probably every state has a temporary license for those who are transferring out-of-state since they realize that most states do not align with their cert requirements.

The exams weren't difficult. For WA we had a basic skills exam (reading/writing/math). They wouldn't accept the basic skills exam I had taken and passed in CO, but they did accept my high school ACT scores, which were enough to get a pass. Then I had a pedagogy test that was painfully simple. My costliest tests were my subject-specific tests: Japanese writing and Japanese speaking. But with your endorsements, these obviously wouldn't be a worry for you."
highschoolteachers,"I have a bachelor's and master's in English. 

I have a standard license to teach 8-12 from Texas and three years of high school teaching experience as well as 5 years of teaching at the community college. 

I did actually take the Praxis while I still lived in Virginia (I forgot I had and have to get the scores again). I will plan to take the VCLA as I want to make it as clear and simple as possible for someone to hire me in Virginia without hang ups about my certifications. I do remember it being difficult to get certified originally in Virginia. It's easier in Texas so I'm glad they mostly transfer, but obviously not as easily as I was lead to believe by reading the VDOE website about transferring my license. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school computers and when we add &gt; or &lt; symbols, I have a disappointingly high amount of students that don't know which symbol to use.   I even write them on the board to help and still it's a struggle for many.   They simply guess. "
highschoolteachers,"I think there are so many subjective factors to consider when ranking states like this. I've taught in IL and I would not rank it towards the top for anything. Their finances as a state are in dire straits, my pay was very very low, even for cost of living. The fact that each town has their own district with a superintendent (even where I grew up the high school was its own district!) is a huge waste of money and resources, IMO. Perhaps my experience would have been better had I been teaching outside of Chicago.

Now, I teach in MD and my pay is really great... COL is higher here, but we are frugal so the biggest adjustment has been housing. Districts are broken up by county so there are many more resources to pull from as far as taxes, people, etc. Our union is very strong and actually does good things for teachers here by negotiating competitive salaries, reducing testing, etc.

I think state retirement should play into these numbers, too. Overall state retirement/pension seems like a joke. I HAVE to contribute money, but can't get an accurate statement unless I request it from the state, I have no way of moving money around to better funds.. basically, I'm not counting on my pension when I retire."
highschoolteachers,"Hiya, Please have a look at this post. I saved it ages ago as it has heaps of great ideas:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/6i8n1a/first_year_teacher_here_what_are_some_things/

• So many pencils. Pencils for days.
• A high-quality electric pencil sharpener? I've never been in an elementary school classroom that didn't have those shitty metal hand-cranked pencil-eaters that pass for pencil sharpeners. You're going to need a good sharpener instead.
• Loose leaf. (Maybe. I was an intervention specialist at a school that provided lined paper, but then when I got my job at the high school, they didn't provide it. When I'm at thrift stores or garage sales and spot unopened packages of lined paper, I grab those faster than anything.)
• Letters for bulletin boards. You might have a die-cut machine in your school, but why gamble?
• Maybe a desk drawer organizer? I'll be honest: mine doesn't actually help all that much, but I'm kind of a human mess anyway so that could be the problem.
• Something to organize papers, like this or this or this. (Or some combination of all of them.)
• 3M Command Hooks.
• Label-making materials, depending on your vision for your classroom's decor.
• Sharpies.
• Masking tape.
A few giant pads of paper for making anchor charts and signs and just who knows what else. I think 3M probably makes some."
highschoolteachers,"In AZ charter schools can hire teachers that have no more then a high school diploma. I had friends right out of high school go teach pe, k and 2nd grade. I lost touch with them but I don’t think they lasted long. Not all of them do it but they can and do when they need to fill a position. "
highschoolteachers,"People teach without education degrees all of the time. My two favorite teachers in high school worked as non-education professionals before starting their teaching careers and never obtained an education degree.
Genuinely curious: what did you hope to accomplish with this question? Are you expecting a serious answer or was it rhetorical? "
highschoolteachers,"I'm teaching in one of NJ's major cities, and the high school is ranked in the bottom 25% of the district. I thought I was going to hate it, but I actually truly like it. I went to school and student taught in very well off districts, so the change of scenery is interesting. When accepting this job, I never thought I would stay at this school, but after a few months, I'm second guessing that."
highschoolteachers,"A lawsuit brought by a parent in a PA court resulted in an additional 12 credit hours in training in special education issues required to earn a degree in education across the entire state. (In 2008, I believe.) University programs had to scramble to change their course requirements because adding 12 credits meant adding almost another full semester to a program that already required 4.5 years to earn a bachelor's degree.

I was told during my own education program that I was personally liable (as a gen ed classroom teacher) to follow a student's IEP requirements, and if I didn't, I could be sued.

I actually failed a student teacher who repeatedly did not follow any student's IEP (her only excuse was ""I forgot"", but after 2 weeks I didn't accept it anymore). 

As a science teacher, I had nearly every student in my grade with an IEP or 504 mainstreamed into my classes -- and only had a teacher's aide in ONE class where I had 10 special needs students.

Another time, every teacher in the middle and high school were sent to a half-day training about dealing with OCD, autism, and students with Tourette's, because we had a family with a son who was diagnosed with all three who had successfully won a lawsuit against the district for his treatment as an elementary student."
highschoolteachers,"""Confrontational"" is the wrong word. Taking a kid's bait isn't what you want to do - teachers who get into shouting matches with their kids have lost. You do have to confront bad behavior, but it can be pretty simple and mellow - call a student to your desk when everyone else is busy, or right when the bell rings. You can speak to them calmly, and they'll usually clam up. 

I had a real behavior issue kid last year, and after a couple of conversations with him over a few weeks I called him to my desk, told him I was writing him up for his behavior, and would call home at the end of the day. He broke down and started sobbing right at my desk, during class. Totally took me by surprise. Turns out his behavior was so out of whack in junior high that he had to sign a behavior contract to be allowed into high school that said he would be out on his ass if he ever got out of line. He thought my write up was going to get him expelled.

It didn't - the first ""minor infraction form"" in my school is primarily just to get the discipline paper trail started and doesn't really *do* anything besides start the process of bringing Admin into the picture, but I tell ya what, I had a much better kid in class."
highschoolteachers,"You can definitely be a teacher if you're introverted or afraid of public speaking. 

I hated speaking in front of people in college and high school. I struggled when giving presentations. However, in front of my kids I have no problem at all. Before this job, I hated answering phone calls and calling people. I have no problem with that anymore. You just need to remember they are kids and you are the one in charge. "
highschoolteachers,"That is no where near the general rule where I am. My admin would laugh at me if I asked permission to show a PG film (high school) and if it was PG-13, they'd ask me what was so bad in it that I was requesting permission. "
highschoolteachers,"I went back to school at 31 to become an art teacher. Most schools will give you different levels of immersion in classrooms. 
My first one was in a classroom of 3rd graders... If you've never been in a classroom of tinies then they can be terrifying. Like, you can squish then easily, they are so small. 
One little boy asked me if I knew who Pinky and the Brain were. I, being a child of the 90s, totally did the whole ""What are we doing tonight Brain?"" thing with him. He looked up at me and said, ""You're AWESOME."" That moment was it for me, I was exactly where I was supposed to be. I'm now teaching high school art. It's amazing."
highschoolteachers,"I agree. I learned that mistake my first year of teaching when I showed a video to class that I didn't review in its entirety. When I played it I was mortified to hear the F bomb. Granted, they were high school students, I haven't made that mistake again. "
highschoolteachers,"When you send kids to the office for every little thing, you undermine your own authority and are showing kids that you can’t handle your own classroom. I only use it for violence or if they are bullying another kid. I maybe send one kid out per year. I teach at a high school of 1300 students from a region that includes some poor farm areas to middle class kids (20 mile radius)."
highschoolteachers,"We only have about 450-500 kids in the high school total. It's typically the same handful of kids that get sent out of class every time for us.

Their punishments depend on how many times the kid has been sent down there, what it was for, etc. It ranges anywhere from just sitting in the office to do the work that class period (kids that normally don't interrupt but were that day, just so they don't disrupt everyone else), lunch detention, after school detention, or alternative school. The repeat offenders usually end up getting suspended. "
highschoolteachers,"I started about the same age, welcome!  Advice:  
-- form relationships with the students.  Get to know them, what they like, who they are, and where they are in the education process - I teach high school and you have to be cognizant of the fact that freshman are very different then seniors - treat them as befits their maturity levels.
-- Be tolerant and remember they are teenagers and are going to say and do stupid things - don't over-react.  Having raised 3 kids I'm far more able to do this then many of the younger teachers.  Practice the art of ""over-looking""
-- Tell stories from your younger days, working days, and about what you've learned in life.  It makes you more real and it helps them learn about life
-- Keep up to some degree about what the world the students live in - it's much different then ours or when we were young.
-- Be enthusiastic about what you teach and tell them why you think it is so important.  They might not ever get to be as interested as you are but they will respect that and behave better.

And to echo other comments - be yourself, do what works for you in the classroom and teaching.  You'll get plenty of advice about what to do, discipline, how to conduct lessons, etc.  Pick the ones that work for you and ignore the rest (except when being observed by admin;-) )

Above all, enjoy it! "
highschoolteachers,"I started in my mid-40s after some 20 years as a journalist.

I think there are a lot of advantages to teaching as a second career, and you've been offered good advice here.

What I'll say is you have 30 years experience in the world beyond your time in high school. Use it to add context, relevance, and authenticity to your lessons. The students will respond to that."
highschoolteachers,"With adults: Be open to feedback, and let colleagues know your preferred ways of getting it (email/in person; compliment sandwich/blunt/_____ was great, the next step is ________). 

With kids: Remember where they’re st developmentally when they inevitably do something frustrating, and remember when they do that it’s not about you. If kids need some sort of consequence, redirection, or reminder, don’t make it about you (so rather than “I need you to,” “You need to” / “Your classmates need” / “doing ______ helps you _______ [be ready for high school or college; get started on the homework in class; stay focused so you can do your best work]”). 

With yourself: Be kind to yourself, practice self care (whatever that looks like for you), and remember that teaching is a beautiful combination of some of the most rewarding and humbling work there is. 

Ah, and don’t grade absolutely everything. 😜"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school teacher in the Netherlands, teaching social sciences. When I was still an intern and learning to become a teacher, I did an internship at a school offering a bilingual program (TTO, tweetalig onderwijs). [More information on TTO Schools.](ikkiestto.nl/) Schools like these teach most of the subjects in English. They also hire native speakers (for example, there was an American teaching geography, an Australian teaching History and a Scottish teacher for English). There are also many international schools. Both options are suitable if you already have a teaching degree in the United States.

If you still need to study for a teaching degree, things will get a bit more difficult. Most programs are in Dutch. I have heard of an [English speaking program to become a primary school teacher](https://stenden.com/en/studies/international-teacher-education-for-primary-schools/), but not of a program for high school teachers."

highschoolteachers,"There's a new high school opening near Gainesville that has jobs posted already, we're probably applying for those. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a student who I taught as a senior but knew as an athlete on the team I coached. He transferred from a different district where he was classified as special Ed, severely handicapped. He was nowhere close, he was mildly dyslexic.  Once he was reassessed in our district (in 9th grade) he began to thrive. This is around the point where I met him. 

 I was lucky enough to have him as a student his senior year. I liked having a nice student in my class and I know that he respected me as his coach. He would often stay 2-3 minutes after class to ask how I was doing, or vacation plans etc. I always had the impression that this kid really cared and thought it was valuable for him to chat for a few minutes. During one of these chats I asked him what his future plans were for after high school. He replied "" I'm just going to go into the military"". I said ""You're JUST going to do that? Are you even aware of WHY you want to?"" He gave a standard statement about the benefits, and AFTER it's all over he'll have a good standard of living. I told him those were all good reasons, but did he really research military life? or was he just settling for something that isn't too bad. He felt that he was too academically inferior to go through community college and transfer to a university and that the military was the only remaining option.
A few weeks later an announcement came through our school about a $10,000 scholarship for students who are interested in earning a vocational certificate from a regional community college.  The following week, during our after class chats, I sat him down and explained the scholarship, we looked at he local community college and looked at some of the course options. There was an informational meeting on campus the following week and I said I  thought he should go to discover other options. I told him that it was ultimately up to him to make a decision, but if he wanted help I'd be there to help him. 
The following week the student returns from the meeting. Turns out he was one of four students interested. This motivates him enough to get the ball rolling and apply. A few weeks later he gets it!  He's now going to school, debt free, training for a trade where he'll probably make more money than I do.

highschoolteachers,"It's a nice change of pace, but depending on the college, the job can vary in so many ways.  Universities might have someone for each type of disability, while smaller colleges might have two or three people total who have to handle everything from student support to finance and invoices.  The pay schedules cam vary, so I can't really comment on anything other than the fact that you should negotiate the highest salary you can, because all pay raises will be based on your starting pay.  Many higher ed jobs like this are not unionized, so some of the stability of a collective bargaining agreement might not exist.  My college has shared senate governance,  but I have no representation and the president, on behalf of the board of trustees, can veto almost anything.  This makes it imperative that you feel out the culture.

In my case, I get paid less, but I have a great supervisor, and the job is much easier and less exhausting than teaching.  When I leave to go home, I don't bring any work with me.  It is its own set of opportunites, especially if you like higher ed, however, I do look back on K-12 teaching with rose colored nostalgia.

Seeing as you have had toxic work experiences and that you can spot red flags, feel out the college to see if it's a good fit.  If it looks kosher, then apply and see what happens.  Because you would potentially work with brand new college students straight out of high school, your K-12 background can really be marketed as a strength in helping those students succeed and to help maintain retention.  "
highschoolteachers,"There are no courses for me to retake, I've never taken one in the first place. When I say I haven't gone over this information, I'm saying my undergraduate and career was in something completely different. Last time I learned all this information was in middle school/ high school. "
highschoolteachers,"Hi. I need to put a disclaimer that I'm not a teacher yet-- I'm going into my fourth year. I attended a few CSET workshops at my CSU school recently, so I'm knee deep in this stuff. 

What you heard about the situation on the ground with lack of job postings at the secondary level is true, at least from hearsay. Both friends and faculty have attested to it. The fact really is that English &amp; Social Science jobs are the hottest jobs to get in K-12. 

I will say, however, that you can't think about things like that. I'm not necessarily a person that believes in fate... But you never know when a job posting will open up for you, and you'll be the right person for it. 

That said, going the multiple subject route is probably the way to go. You have to pass an exam called the RICA which is supposedly a beast. It's heavy on linguistics content. And of course, the CSETs. I've since learned that with a multiple subject credential, one can teach at the middle school level, provided you took a 'block' i.e. English and Social Science. 

And finally, if you still want the high school English job, then all you have to do is pass the English CSET (heh, easier said then done) and go back to school once more for a single methods course to add on. No additional internship needed if you already have one credential. 

I have a friend right now is pursuing a high school credential (decided elementary wasn't for him), and he explained that his methods course was a cake walk, and had he had to do the internship in the high school subject, it would've so much more difficult. This is heavily anecdotal--I can't substantiate it myself--but from rumblings like those, it seems that single subject internships are tougher than elementary ones. Again, this is probably heavily situational. Every credential program is different and hard asses can be found anywhere. 

"
highschoolteachers,"A former colleague of mind had very similar credentials. After teaching high school and middle school, she switched to working at a local zoo as their school and teacher programs supervisor. "
highschoolteachers,"My class is mostly reading instruction, essay composition, and a small amount of research and grammar; I use literature as a means to those ends, not as the end in itself. I think building reading stamina with rich, authentic texts is really important in the middle grades, rather than just learning to master the easy answers and short lessons found in basal readers. 

I would also like to see a stronger focus on grammar and punctuation during middle school than what currently occurs in my district, along with a higher standard for proper letter formation in handwriting. It’s really, really hard to get a 14-18-year-old to stop putting random capital letters in their writing, or to stop drawing lowercase Bs like plus signs, or to put full spaces between their words, or to remember to use apostrophes for possessives, if they haven’t been held accountable for those things in a long time (if ever) - they want to argue that these things don’t matter, because their prior teachers, and teachers in other subjects areas, don’t prioritize it. I think it’s easier to teach good habits when they are younger than it is to un-teach bad ones in high school. But most of my ninth graders come in with little skill in all of these areas, and we work through it regardless. I know MS/JH teachers are doing the best they can, just like the rest of us.

II probably teach basics more than anything else, and try to embed some opportunities for critical thinking along the way. The only real skills I count on them coming in with is the ability to decode text and compose simple sentences; I’ve had to teach basically every other skill you can think of in ELA. "
highschoolteachers,"Beggars can’t be choosers. It’s nice to talk tough before you get out to the real world and have to find a decent job. 

Guess what? Life don’t work like that. In high school and college, I had all these unrealistic notions of jobs and pay. It was only until I got out of college and began working that I understood how hard it is to find a decent job if you don’t have the right preparation or connections. You are in for a rude awakening, just like I was if you continue thinking like that.

Unless you already have some serious skills or marketable degrees, don’t think that working hard is beneath you. I know people with highly valuable Engineering and Accounting degrees who have to work more than 40 hours a week. And these people have good jobs by any standards.  If you have other skills I would advise you to bail and go to that career ASAP before you waste more time on this education degree. If not, buckle down and finish this degree. At least you won’t be wasting money. You can go out there and look for other jobs, but I am warning you,it’s not that easy esp. if you have no other valuable skills or degrees. 



"
highschoolteachers,"I teach at a rural middle school and I agree with your comments about marks for mediocrity. My honors 8th graders were pissed when they didn’t get full points on their essays simply because they did one. When we practiced revision, they said it was perfect, didn’t make changes that were suggested and turned in final drafts with edit marks on their essays. This happened for both students who used Google Classroom and those who chose to hand write it. This lead me to teach a mini unit on editing. Things like capitalization and punctuation are still issues with my students. I just wish I could get my 8th graders to try. Many of them are still concrete but the helplessness and apathy with the knowledge they will go on to high school and middle school grades don’t matter is frustrating at times. 

As a high school teacher, do you worry about the basics or focus more on teaching them to think critically and interact with the texts? What skills do you want your incoming students to have?"
highschoolteachers,"I had an “aha” moment recently at a training with other teachers from my school. We were practicing grading student writing samples according to a very specific rubric, and I gave something a C that many other teachers felt was worthy of an A. (C was the correct answer, BTW.) One of them was disgruntled and said, “I’d like to see you all write a better essay than this!”

My mind was blown. I had never before realized what the end result would be of allowing teacher candidates to slide through college without learning how to read and write critically, but in that moment, it was so obvious why my students always struggled and dragged their feet when it came time to revise and improve their mediocre essays - it was because most of the adults they knew gave them full marks for mediocrity, and didn’t see any need to improve upon the first draft.  It’s a cycle - the teachers accepted that level of work because they themselves got away with that level of work in high school, and it just continues on through the generations. If teachers themselves can’t distinguish between mediocre, good. and excellent writing, then what hope do the kids have for learning how to write well?"
highschoolteachers,"Daily PE?  I moved states, and my kids now have it every-other day.  I was amazed!  I came from a state where kids had PE one day a week for 40 minutes in elementary.  I didn't have PE at all in middle school, and I had it one semester in high school."
highschoolteachers,"Is that because they’re returning to where they once were? Because I was reading the rules in this article and thinking to myself, I didn’t have to take PE in high school, in the 90’s, because I was a part of the flag team/marching band. Maybe they realized that giving waivers and letting kids out of PE is a bad practice. I don’t know for sure, I’m just wondering. "
highschoolteachers,"You been in a P.E. classily? If it’s anything like the two schools I’ve worked in then it’s a joke. Not in any part due to the teachers, I love my P.E. teachers, but due to how P.E. has been treated and pushed away. 

You think your class sizes are large? Imagine double that now. Maybe you’ll have 2 or 3 teachers down there but if one of them is out and you’re short or sub then I guess you’re on your own. With the exception of swimming (if your school has a pool) students aren’t required to change clothes because the unfortunate truth is many of them struggle enough for clothes. This leads to quite the rag tag group of students who become increasingly difficult to manage. They hardly get a chance to teach anything since they can have over 100 students of varying fitness level that they need to manage. It basically becomes a free for all and you’re making sure no one gets hurt. 

I wasn’t physically fit in middle and high school but I loved P.E.  It gave me a chance to play and have fun. Our class size was also that of a normal class and I didn’t grow up in the age of social media with all these body image issues. Most students end up hating P.E. and don’t want to participate. 

It’s a struggle being a P.E. teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I think you should continue with the degree/program. You mentioned that you'll be getting your certification in May if all goes well, and that means you'll have graduated with a degree. I feel like it is a waste of money to drop it all now because you're hesitating.. 

Here's what I can tell you about teaching/my advice for you moving forward: 

1) yes, there are long hours, however depending on the grade level, content, and people you work with (teachers willing to share lessons or help out in any way), this can be a lot less time consuming than you'd expect. There are also a TON of resources out there on the interwebs so you can definitely find useful places to help you out. (Check out the Reddit subs for starters.. also, I know we all hate that they require accounts for viewing pictures, but Pinterest actually has a lot of useful lessons on their site so maybe make an account and browse through there; teachers pay teachers is also useful). 

2) depending on where you want to teach (private/public school), I can almost guarantee you do not have to create a formal lesson plan for every lesson in the real world of teaching. I only lesson plan formally when I am being observed and they require one. So yeah, I get that you hate lesson planning, most people do lol, just suck it up for this last semester - think of it as one of the things you just need to do get your degree. 

3) working with kids is going to be great, it's one of the most motivating factors for most teachers (including myself), but remember that they're not gonna be perfect angels and even if you have that wonderful, perfect, lesson plan it's not going to go the way you want it to, so expect that when you're going into the full time internship next semester. 

4) if you're not sure of other careers you want to get into as opposed to teaching, it can serve as a good buffer for you while you figure it out.. you'll probably teach the same grade again in the years to come (and that's really the benefit of staying in the profession in the long run - you become familiar with the content and ways to teach it so it will require less time to prepare and consciously think about each thing you teach). However if you wanna figure out something else for your career, you can have a full time job, decent pay upon graduation, long breaks to research for your next job/fill out applications/etc and still enjoy some time you get with the kids while teaching. 

I wanna leave you with this: yeah, if you look at it short sighted it's just a job, and maybe if you're slacking one day it's not a big deal, I mean the kids will still learn something right?!and truly, to not burn out that first year, there may be one of those ""watch a video and answer some questions"" days for your own sanity, that's okay. However in the grand scheme of things, don't tell yourself that you're absolutely going to refuse putting in any extra time to plan for the kids before you've even gotten the job - you may find that the relationship you have with the kids makes you enjoy coming up with new plans and figuring out what to teach. Plus, you can't go into work not prepared, it's not like a regular 9-5 job where often (not always), if you screw up, it's on you and hey the worst that can happen is you get fired. Here, you have a class full of kids and if you're not prepared they're either gonna are your life miserable (lack of classroom management/lack of activities to do/etc) or you'll drive yourself crazy. 

TLDR; Don't quit when you're just about about to graduate with a degree for something you can use at least as a backup/filler career till you find what you really want to do in life. Also, go to work prepared (that doesn't mean you need to spend 50+ hours to prepare).

Source: 2nd year of being a full time high school teacher. 

PS) edTPA sucks, but if you work hard you'll get through it. Second semester classes at University shouldn't be as intense since you do the full time internship, but make sure you stay organized and manage your time well.

highschoolteachers,"College made me lazier than I was in high school. Too much free time. 

(I'm using 'made me' loosely here, I recognize my own personal responsibility here.)"
highschoolteachers,"Hey that’s my area! Early intervention is ESSENTIAL for student success if the student is struggling. The biggest thing I like about RTI models is that it stresses continual changes to groupings - if Student A is really having a hard time with oral fluency, then that student is put into my fluency group and for several weeks that’s ALL we do. Student A can then test out. An effective RTI model can really help more students because the groupings can change every few weeks. You have to be careful with RTI though because it stresses a magic pill way of thinking - If I can just fix Student B’s informational text comprehension then everything will be okay again! Reading is not like that, there’s many processes occurring at the same time to lead to understanding and you can’t isolate one and expect it to be the magic solution. 

I teach at a 5, 6, 7 middle school and we have five reading teachers in our school, of which I am one. When we were doing our initial round of assessments and data combing and grouping, it was very clear that A LOT of students needed our help, but due to limits of our schedules and not enough people, some kids who could really use a semester of reading intervention don’t qualify. I really think we could increase our test barriers to the lowest 32-35% of students instead of capping at 25%, and have three interventionists per grade level. Right now we have one interventionist doing all of 7th, don’t tell me that’s enough, it’s definitely not. 

We need more specialists and we need them at ALL levels of K-12. There’s a huge focus on primary and elementary specialists but there’s still kids who need help in middle and high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school Math teacher in California. You don't need to major in Secondary Education (I'm a pure math major), as long as you can pass CSET tests for Math or Physics. You'll also need a credential, which is mandatory to teach. The Masters is nice for a small pay raise, but it's not mandatory. There are some programs (like the one I went to) that offered a credential and a Masters of Ed in one year."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, I could really use a portable cellphone jammer."
highschoolteachers,"The high school that my students go into does have a vo-tech program, but it's pretty terrible due to the fact that there are four different vocational high schools (grades 9-12) in my district to cater to students wanting a vocational education as opposed to a traditional academic education. However, most students in my district who would traditionally qualify for a vocational education program are usually either done with school and ready to just pass along in a traditional academic high school until they're done, or just drop out once they're of legal age. Thankfully that isn't a large percentage of students in my district, but it still makes me think of what they could have done instead.

It would have to be the superintendent's call to get rid of social promotion. They have already done away with it in a neighboring district. I'm just waiting for that to transfer over to mine. 

"
highschoolteachers,"So what's going on there?  Do the parents really think their kids aren't going to get anything out of school?  Do they not care about their kids, do they not have faith in the education system, is there some local industry they assume the kids will fall into after high school that doesn't require them to be educated?"
highschoolteachers,"Does your high school not have a vocational component?

How would you get rid of social promotion.  Is that the superintendent's call?"
highschoolteachers,"Lack of creative thinking. It trickles up to high school as well. And I teach theatre, so creative thinking is a MUST. But often the kids want the “right” answer, and they can’t think of creative solutions to problems or design prompts. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school Biology. Not sure about the concept of grades 5-8 (couldn't find a good explanation anywere, if someone has it please hit me up!).

But aside from the lack of study skills (mentioned here many times already). It's probably reading, as in actually comprehending and understanding what they are reading. Especially on tests they seem to only read half the questions or not read them correctly. So say I give them this question:

""Which of the following plants does not have flowers""

They'll put down all the plants that do have flowers. It seems that they do not take the time to properly read the questions before they answer. "
highschoolteachers,"We are not going to change things by wishing.

We need to instill a good old fashioned work ethic.  Start at 1st grade.  5 minutes of homework per grade every night.  5 minutes at first grade, 10 at 2nd grade and so on.  At high school bump it up to an hour.  

That’s something we can do right now and it won’t require an act of Congress or a tax referendum.  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school algebra I.  The 9th graders I get are lacking basic arithmetic skills.  I know the bright students take algebra in middle school and not in high school, but the majority of 9th graders cannot add, subtract, multiple or divide.  Forget fractions and decimals.  They can’t handle 1 and 2 digit numbers.  

Also they have no work ethic.  They think they will get everything in life just because they want it.  

"
highschoolteachers,"That's part of the equation and yes, it is done in many places. For example, I grew up in New Jersey where there was a court case called ABBOTT V. BURKE which stipulated that funding to low income districts needed to be supplemented by state and federal monies so that it would be nearly equal (it also limited class sizes and added a tech component in later years). I'm sure there are similar regulations in other states. 

Here's the issue. Fair is not always equal. While this decision makes funding to low income and high income schools equal, it doesn't take into account the increased needs of students in low income districts. Things like a higher proportion of IEP/ESOL students, physiological issues caused by living in poverty, achievement gap (which starts before they even enter school and grows with age), food access/security, feeling of safety and security in the home and in the community, family drug use/abuse, undiagnosed ADD/ADHD, less access to medical treatment/dentist/eye doctor, and increased school security are all issues faced mainly by low income schools. All of the aforementioned issues cost money. My suburban high school had ONE ""security officer"" in the building (just a retired cop who sat in the lunch room all day). The school I currently work for has a team of 10 security guards, and we only have a 25% FARMS rate and are located in a pretty wealthy community. Security teams in rough school would be even bigger. Add all the costs for the other issues faced by low income students and you can see how quickly the extra money would be eaten up. 

What you would really need to make things fair would be to divert *more* funding to high needs schools and cut the budgets in the high income schools. This would help address the myriad issues that I mentioned before. However, there isn't the political will to do that because the people making that decision would have to put the needs of high poverty schools in front of high income schools (and their parents). "
highschoolteachers,"I actually ended up leaving again for New Zealand, where I taught at a public high school.  I came back to the States to the same NYC public school I left.  I've loved my time abroad, but right now, it's important that we're close to my wife's family.  We've got a two year old, they're getting older, and being just a couple of hours away instead of a twenty four hour flight is far more manageable for everyone.  

NYC has also been pretty good to us both.  We have great jobs in the school system, we've got solid health care and retirement benefits, and we were able to buy a house last summer.  The cost of living and pay in both Seoul and Wellington wouldn't have made this possible.  "
highschoolteachers,"My degree is in 9-12 social studies, and I taught at a high school my first year and loved it. It was only 50% (I taught two instead of three classes) and I worked my ass off. I was only contractually obligated to be there during those times I taught, so I could theoretically get there and teach and then go home, but I stayed and planned nearly every single day. I knew it would probably turn into a full-time job at the end of the year, so I tried to kiss as much ass as possible. 

At the end of the year, it did in fact turn into a full-time position, and I had to interview for it again and seemingly thought it was a formality, because I had done everything right and by the books, but they gave it to some fucking loser with a PE degree who took the praxis so he could teach social studies and coach wrestling. I got fucked, in other words.

So at the recommendation of the lead teacher, I tried out middle school and I wound up at (unknowingly) the single worst middle school in the county and have been there for the past couple years. I’m pretty much in a permanent state of misery, but luckily I love my coworkers, so that’s the only thing keeping me sane."
highschoolteachers,"I was part time (well, honestly full-time, I taught two instead of three classes) at a local high school a couple years ago and loved it. That’s the only year so far I haven’t strongly disliked. I think it’s more to do with it being high school instead of part time though, because I can’t stand middle school."
highschoolteachers,"Stop putting all students on a college preparatory curriculum where they are taking 4 years of English and Math when they come to high school below grade level in English and Math.

These students need to be on an alternative track to graduate with a curriculum geared towards gaining skills/certification for employment in high-need fields that don't require 4 years of college (trades, nursing, dental hygienist, etc.)."
highschoolteachers,"I went to an international high school in Japan, where most teachers came from outside the country.  International schools, as well as schools specifically for students who are foreign but may not speak English (French schools, German schools, etc) are also an option. The school I attended only accept teaching position applications through a site called Schrole, which is basically a teaching jobs database just for international schools. My school assisted with work visas and housing as well. "
highschoolteachers,"Same situation in AZ where I went to high school. Passing the budget override was such a struggle because there was a retirement community right on the edge of the district next to the biggest school. Luckily tax credits always made a huge impact to help out, but that budget override is a critical thing for most districts. "
highschoolteachers,"Sped teachers are in extremely high demand and likely any job you get will be sped.  Sped is unlikely to give you lots of opportunities to teach history.    Special ed math or special ed LA are more common, but where I am anyway Social Studies is often skipped or gen ed for most kids in sped (middle school anyway).  

So it will make finding a job easier, but you're likely to be a SPED teacher.  If you don't want to teach SPED, don't do it.   In my area I've seen a lot of social studies/ELL overlap though where the teacher still teaches history, and ELL is also high demand.

Edit: that being said, I do have a SS endorsment and am working on my Sped endorsment, but I want to teach sped, not ss.  I just realized a bit late.

Actually, you might be better off getting a Language Arts/Social Studies cert, especially if you want to do middle school.  I know some principals aren't even bothering to look at Social Studies teaches without LA endorsements in the middle schools in my area.  I don't know how that would translate to high school."
highschoolteachers,"Administration at ALL levels (school, district, state, and federal) need to nix social promotion for good. Instead of social promotion, we need serious tiered support for our struggling students and, in upper grades, tracked paths for students who continue to not show an interest in advancing their academic studies and would rather study a trade/vocational discipline.

In my district, students can be held back twice: once in elementary school, and once in middle school. Not in high school. I teach the inaugural year at my middle school and most of the kids come in as complete messes. While a little bit of transitional struggle is expected, I was stunned to find out that out of my 105 kids, 20 were socially promoted--and I'm sure these numbers are much higher in other areas.  Social promotion does nothing to help these students. By the time they come to me, they already assume that they're going to be passed on forever. In high school, several of them drop out or just barely pass 12th grade and then have extreme difficulty finding work. It's ridiculous. Stopping this ludicrous policy of social promotion and instead implementing real supports/pathways for our students would be an excellent start to give ALL students the education that they deserve."
highschoolteachers,"You mentioned to OP that going back to your high school is only a good idea if it is underprivileged. Does the fact that you went there count as an “in”?

Also on a somewhat related note, if a school states online “minimum 5 years teaching experience,” is that a hard or soft line? Would a year of student teaching count, or are they probably looking for formal teaching experiences?

Thanks for the info!"
highschoolteachers,"While I find this idea interesting, I do think that in practice, kids who may have something to offer intellectually will be pushed into trades without anyone giving them the chance. I teach at a rural high school, and I have lots of trade-type kids who really blow me away when they analyze literature. I know that's not really a skill that many of them will make a living from or anything, but I guess I worry about limiting kids' potentials, you know?"
highschoolteachers,"100% this. There is no accountability for academic performance pre-high school. I can have one fourth grader who can do algebra and another who tells me that 5-5=5 (because there's two fives, and two fives is 10, and then you take away 5) and they both get passed to fifth grade without a second thought. Our district holds summer school over their heads, but there's no follow through. 
I firmly believe that if we started requiring 3rd graders to pass the state test, it would at least start to fix some things. It would be a nightmare at first to manage, but it would be a wake up call to those who are completely capable but just not motivated to put forth the effort or maybe just need some extra time to grasp the material. People say that holding students back harms self-esteem, but I think it is way more damaging to keep pushing kids ahead when they're not ready because they'll just continue to feel stupid. "
highschoolteachers,"I tutored at a community college last semester and the experience was eye-opening. The curriculum was even more horrible than in high school where I teach. Free CC sounds like a great idea, but if it's basically ""thirteenth grade"" then it's just more wasre."
highschoolteachers,I teach high school history too! And I've experienced the same thing over and over. History is one of those things that is going to be different depending on what perspective it's being told from and that's the number one thing I tell them from day one :)
highschoolteachers,"None. I teach at a Title I inner city high school, and I have yet to receive a Christmas gift from my students in my 3 years there. I’m just fine with that. "
highschoolteachers,"The biggest problem with education is that we're still using a model from the 1800s, BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER. That's why we still have up to 34 kids to 1 teacher in most classrooms. Because it's CHEAP.

That's also why most teachers are female. If more men were in the profession they would demand higher pay and fewer hours of work at home. (They have already demanded that by not being the in profession and choosing more lucrative professions that provide them with more down-time after work and more camaraderie with colleagues.)

How to fix this? Maybe all schools starting in 1st grade should have class periods with specialists? The kids go from room to room, switching every hour or two. Two hours for LA, 90 minutes for math, 90 minutes for science, 150 minutes spread through the week for music and art, and 2 hours a week on social studies and history. (I'm shorting SS and history only because there's not enough hours in the week.)

Why would this work? Because teachers would no longer have to prep for 5 or 6 subjects in the day. They would just have to worry about one. They could become experts. 

HOWEVER, this also means we need smaller class sizes. 20 max, in K-12.

WHY? Because for all but high-income families, being a kid in America today is HARD. 1 out of every 4 or 5 kids lives in poverty with all the insecurity and mayhem that brings. I think it's about 50% that are being raised in single parent households now. Kids lives SUCK in many ways these days. 

The system designed in the 1800s was built on small-town life, two parent families with one parent home most of the day to handle emergencies. Plus, in the 1800s, basic RESPECT of adults was  taught at home. Those teachings, or respecting your place in the pecking order of a school, flew out the window starting in the 1980s. NO ONE respects teachers anymore, and respecting teachers is not taught in many homes. 

So if the kids aren't learning social skills and respect at home, that teaching duty falls to the schools. Elementary teachers spend hours and hours every year teaching little kids how to function in society.  That's the MAIN reason classes should never be more than 20 - so kids can be a part of a large family during the day, to learn this stuff, and not just a face lost in the crowd. 

Same with middle school and high school - no more than 20 per class, to meet their emotional and maturation needs. 

ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY. The federal government is like a Deadbeat Dad who doesn't want to pay.

So then, because we don't fix all these issues early, Deadbeat Dad gets to be employed by the local prison, where all his failed children wind up. 

Oh, and one easy fix that also costs MONEY - every school with more than 500 kids should have at least one full-time counselor, and every school district should have at least one full-time child psychologist on staff to supervise and advise all the counselors. "

highschoolteachers,"On the whole, I think TFA amounts to a badly executed good intention, and I'm highly skeptical that it accomplishes any of the things it claims to on an organizational scale. BUT, as with most things, I think it can be a positive experience in some cases. My sister went into college wanting to be a teacher, was talked out of it by my parents, then got a work-study job in a preschool her sophomore year which rekindled her interest too late to switch back from sociology to education without severely delaying her graduation. She applied for TFA because it was the most direct route into a classroom, which at that point she knew she wanted. She spoke well of the training - a whirlwind, fast paced, sometimes overwhelming experience, but run by people who knew what they were talking about. The school she was placed at had caring staff, decent climate, some administrative headaches, like pretty much every school in this country. She did her two years in Oklahoma and generally enjoyed it, then moved back to Chicago and found that her license wouldn't transfer to Illinois until she went and got her master's degree. Most of the people she met through TFA ended up in professions other than teaching, which the research I've seen supports, and the ones that stayed and succeeded were the ones that already had experience in some school environment. On a personal level, she still reflects on it as a positive experience. She even worked as a trainer for TFA over the summer a couple years ago.

In my opinion, if you're going into it with experience in some capacity in education, you might be okay. If you've never stepped foot in a classroom as something other than a student, the training they give you will be insufficient and you could easily come to hate the job... A couple people from my high school went TFA and ended up in that boat, and are now all in law school or an MBA program. If you stay in teaching your license will restrict your options in some states, and you'll be labeled a TFA teacher, which may not be a good thing. If you think you might want to be a teacher but you're not sure, go volunteer at a school, shadow a teacher, work/volunteer at a Boys &amp; Girls Club or recreation center or YMCA. Look into graduate programs that offer licensure and find out what kind of field experience you'll get in those programs. I would favor that route, unless you already feel comfortable in a classroom and legitimately think you're 5 weeks of training away from being able to survive a challenging job in a challenging environment."

highschoolteachers,"You want better teachers? They way to do that is not by making the teachers jump through more hoops. It’s by paying them better. If you doubled the salary of every teacher in the state WAY more college students would go into the career and increase competition for jobs. Increased competition means you can hire good teachers and get rid of bad ones.

Oh and we have to get class sizes down. I teach high school and have 5 classes, sizes 17, 33, 34, 32, 37. I cant do labs I have good classroom management and it’s still a struggle to get 30+ people in a room all concentrating on the same thing. In the class of 17 I can work one on one with students, once you get 30+ I spend the entire class getting kids on task and have no time to answer questions"
highschoolteachers,"I would make no money.

(I am a high school math teacher in an alternative ed high school with a transient population, lots of attendance problems, lots of fundamentals missing that I am trying to reteach... needless to say, grades aren't awesome, and quite a few students fail each trimester.)"
highschoolteachers,"I would say by freshmen year of high school we start pushing kids into trade school. It is frustrating to hear from a parent “oh yea they have failed every year of math from 7th grade till now...” 
then how do you expect them to understand Algebra 1 and 2??"
highschoolteachers,"You have the logistics down for the teaching credential.

Originally, I also wanted to go back to my high school to teach math because it was what I knew and what I was comfortable with, but the district I student taught in hired me. In the end, it turned out to be a blessing because I am so happy where I am. Always be open to being somewhere different.

While it is not required to do any tutoring or TA classes. It is a great way to get your feet wet with being a teacher. If you want to work with high school students, you can also be an AVID tutor."
highschoolteachers,"Pull this young lady aside. Have an adult conversation with her, as much as appropriate given her age and maturity level. Calmly explain that this is your class and she is there at your discretion. Then offer her some kind of position of responsibility in class which allows her to be in a spotlight but in a manner you control, not her. An example could be having her pass out materials, get all the laptops powered up, etc. If she bites, and in time most will, she will end up buying into your classroom culture and help to enforce it with her peers. Of course it can take months for this to happen, but I have used this approach to successfully wrangle some very tough high school students who sound very similar to your ringleader. Good luck and hang in. She needs you to throw down firm, consistent boundaries with a big helping of caring and affection. She is essentially testing you. Once you win her over her underlings should follow suit."
highschoolteachers,"DoDDS grad here as well.  I've considered it in the future, but I think I read that you can only turn down an assignment once and if you turn down a second one, you can no longer apply?  

One of my concerns is a future government shutdown/furlough and not getting paid.  

One thing that does draw me to it is as a high school teacher is knowing that many high school students come from families that value education.  I mean, if a kid's seventeen, a lot of parents are gong to be beyond the twenty years and officers.  I also like the idea that kids are aware that their behavior can have career consequences/reflections on their parents and have an additional reason to stay out of trouble (not that I always did)."
highschoolteachers,"Just make sure you are somewhat familiar with the art/theater/music/pe stuff if you didn't pursue any of those things as hobbies/studies. The cliffnotes study book is pretty comprehensive and definitely harder than the actual test in my experience. I took it all together in order to save money/time. The math and reading stuff was a smidge harder than the cbest but honestly mostly a joke if you were fine in high school. 

It's really not a big deal at all!"
highschoolteachers,"I’m not a teacher, but a recently graduated high school student. From what I know based off of personal encounters, and what teachers have said, my school’s admin were really great. Teachers only said good things about them, and there was only one Vice Principal who was unpopular students because she dress coded students a lot (dress code was SUPER lax before this new VP came, which is why I think there was a lot of disdain towards them). 

From what I’m aware of, the only classroom influence that admin has is making our teachers create a “learning target” for each day, which us students are “supposed to know.” Every single teacher creates the learning targets to show that they’re doing them, but they never go over it with us, as it’s really not beneficial to learning. 

One summer I had to make a cheesy, funny video with my schools superintendent, which I’m now realizing was most likely shown to the teachers for some back to school thing. 

Before joining this sub, having a bad admin is not even something I thought of as an issue for a teacher. I hope that if I follow through with my plans to become a teacher, I can get a good admin!"
highschoolteachers,I just want to add that in your situation it could be a good opportunity and some teachers really do well with middle school drama but just be ready for it to go either way. Try your best but we have a broken education system that only really asks students to get it together when they get to high school. Based on your background I think you would do better in a high school than middle school.
highschoolteachers,"Damn, I had a teacher in high school who always let kids charge their phones during his class. I always thought it was way too nice and if they didn't charge their phones that was on them. I now realized it was all a trap."
highschoolteachers,"I've realized that people don't change from their middle/high school personalities.  It seems like it in college, because everything is very \~open\~ in some places, but you get to a job and every job has cliques, mean girls, ""jocky/fratty"" boys, etc.  And just like high school, some people bridge the groups, and others exclude whomever they want."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, your dreaming if you think kids are going to read the syllabus. You can force them by doing different activities, but most won’t remember much within a couple of weeks. Syllabi in high school are more cya than useful. 

Save yourself some time and don’t spend too much of it on the syllabus"
highschoolteachers,Yikes. I feel guilty for letting people know my kids are selling butter braids or Christmas trees for fundraisers at their high school (I'm at elementary). I can't imagine trying to make money for myself off of coworkers.
highschoolteachers,"I have them put it in a paper bag, then I staple the bag.  They get to keep it and I never touch it, but they cannot get it out again and I'll hear it crinkling if they do.  If they get it out or are repeat offenders, I'll take the phone and send them to the office.  This is with middle schoolers, though.  I've been at a high school with a super lax policy and unsupportive admin that basically resulted in teachers making phone jails or giving up entirely."
highschoolteachers,"I don’t have any research for you, but I’ll give you my take on it. 

Kiddos with moderate disabilities shouldn’t necessarily be in the same setting as those with severe because students are legally entitled to be in the least restrictive environment.    So for example, high school students with moderate disabilities could be successful with a 15:1 classroom with access to the general Ed curriculum (or even ICT with appropriate supports) while students with severe disabilities could require an 8:1 with an Alternative/ life skills curriculum.  

All students should always be placed in the LRE, with the greatest access to the Gen Ed curriculum.    So in small districts where you don’t have every setting in every grade, it makes most sense to have bridge classes based on ability level rather than on age."
highschoolteachers,"That’s not easy for some kids. If they take the bus and staying after school means mom or dad has to leave work early and is going to be angry, they may very well just choose the option that will lead to more bullying. Because their teacher has put them in an unnecessary lose-lose scenario.

It’s not funny to pressure students to embarrass themselves in front of the class. Some of you either miraculously weren’t self conscious at all in high school or have forgotten what it felt like."
highschoolteachers,"I went to high school in NWA! I teach in TX now, though."
highschoolteachers,"My high school last year was like this. We had to have our lesson plans in every Monday by 9 AM. Each department required a different format. ELA required our objective, standards, do now, instruction, closure, check for understanding, technology integration, and materials. They were obnoxious. I'm moving to the middle school in my district this year and I've already been informed that we have to turn in lesson plans for every two weeks, not sure of the format though. I think two weeks ahead is a lot to ask for. How the hell am I supposed to know exactly what I'm going to do for an entire two weeks? Things change day to day. I'm not looking forward to being called out on how my lessons aren't exactly what I planned two weeks ago."
highschoolteachers,I’ve taught in the same district for 20+ years and I’ve never had to turn in lesson plans.  None of the other schools in my district have done it either.  I’m in a high school district on the west coast.  🤷‍♂️
highschoolteachers,"My high school required gym all four years. They had to get creative by senior year. We did badminton, yoga, golf, roller skating. There was another class that did outdoor adventuring. We also had a pool and that was an option. Even with all that I skipped gym all the time. 😂 I also loved jump roping and line dancing,"
highschoolteachers,"I've taught at a high school with 110 full-time licensed teachers before. Even if the principal wanted that pain, that wouldn't even be possible."
highschoolteachers,"There shouldn’t be academic consequences unless they are using their phone to cheat. Is there any way you could implement phones in your classroom lessons, like QR codes or poll everywhere? Maybe you could have a charging station in your room where kiddos can charge their phones away from their desks so it benefits you (no phones during class) and them (allowed to charge their phone)? 

When I was in high school, the teacher with the least amount of phone issues was the teacher who had a rule that your phone could be out but it had to be face-up on the desk, and you couldn’t pick it up, so if you wanted to text or browse social media, you could, but it was “slow” because they couldn’t hold their phone, and if they were also deterred because they like their privacy. The only time they got into trouble for their phone was if she asked a question and you couldn’t answer because you weren’t paying attention, which that was when you had to put your phone away, so kids paid attention so they wouldn’t have to put their phone away. During class work, she didn’t care as long as the assignment was done (no cheating) and the phone stayed flat on the desk. Then, if a kid did use their phone to cheat, it was an academic consequence for cheating, not having their phone out."
highschoolteachers,"Exactly, you've got teachers who were in high school during Colombine now. That argument does not work. I have a colleague who was part of his school's ""trench coat mafia"". You can't make that argument when the people who were gamers and awkward kids are now teaching the next generation of gamers and awkward kids."
highschoolteachers,"I don't expect you to ban bathroom breaks entirely, but there needs to be some kind of incentive to actually go at break time. It's ludicrous that kids are arriving at my lesson after a break and within 5 minutes demand to go to the toilet and tell me that they DESPERATELY have to go. When I ask why they didn't go 5 minutes ago in their break, they just shrug and say they didn't think about it then. As a teacher/as an adult, we would all go to the toilet in all of our breaks, because we understand that we can't just walk out of a lesson because we couldn't be bothered to walk to the toilet in our breaks. 6 year olds are developing bladder control but by the time they get to high school, they can handle going at break/lunch times and not leaving lessons (unless they have a medical issue). There has to be some kind of middle ground and a way to train up six year olds for when they're eleven year olds and going to high school."
highschoolteachers,"I often don't know what I'm doing tomorrow, because I base what I'm doing tomorrow very heavily on what happens today. I teach high school math and get very strong feedback from administration and students alike. In particular, I get strong feedback from kids who have always had difficulty with math and who suddenly find that they're understanding it more in my class.

A big part of that is precisely because I don't plan for the next two months or two weeks or even two days. I have a very general plan, certainly, of what topics we are going to address in which order, and I have some particular lessons planned out that we will do when we hit them, but otherwise I based what we're doing tomorrow almost exclusively on what we're doing today. Today I'll teach a certain topic and I'll see how well the kids understand it. They may have classwork or homework to practice that topic. I check on their classwork to see what they're doing correctly or incorrectly, and I consider what they said and asked during the lesson itself, and often I even wait until the beginning of class the next day to see what successes and difficulties they had with the homework and what we do next is based on all of *that*. Did they understand the topic perfectly and just need to move on so they don't get bored? Were they completely lost and need to go over everything again but broken down into even smaller chunks? Did they understand most of it but need some kind of practice or lesson or activity to address one particular step or part of the topic?  

If I had to write out and follow plans for each day for several weeks or even a single week, the kids wouldn't learn this stuff nearly as well. I am not by any means an expert in teaching other subjects and I imagine that detailed planning ahead like this might work better in some of them, but I have to think that to some degree no matter what you're teaching applying real time feedback  and observations of the kids would yield better overall results than planning everything far ahead and assuming - or ignoring - the way they're going to respond to different things."
highschoolteachers,"What level do teach?  I've taught high school in two districts, and have never seen this practice."
highschoolteachers,"Have a sign in sheet for the parents. This would be a great opportunity for you to also find parent volunteers, so I would have a column for names, a yes/no column to ask if they'd like to volunteer, and if they do volunteer there would be 2 additional columns for phone numbers and email addresses. 

Be warm and friendly. Shake hands. Greet students. Ask if they have any questions. If you have elementary students, they'll want to know where they're sitting. 

If you plan on sending home monthly newsletters as I do as a high school teacher or if you plan on sending home weekly take home folders with graded papers and notes about student performance, this would also be a good opportunity to share this information about parents."
highschoolteachers,I attended a DoDDs high school and loved it. Definitely worth considering for those interested in living abroad.
highschoolteachers,"I’m a little lenient (I teach high school). I float, so I can’t have a charging station, but I let them charge at empty outlets in the room. If it’s on their desk, fine. They want to check the time, fine. But when it starts interfering with work, I say something. If I have to call out the same kid frequently, I threaten them with The Envelope. 

If they get The Envelope, they have to seal their phone in it. I never touch their phone. They can rip open the envelope the second the bell rings, but the envelope is printed with my policy, that getting this far is -5 off their participation grade, and their parents have to sign it and it has to be returned to me. 

Usually I only have to hand out 1-2 a year."
highschoolteachers,"Congratulations on the new job! I have been teaching high school history for 20 years. I know it seems intimidating, but you'll do great. I start the year by having my students make a constitution for the class. I have a worksheet if you want to message me. I really like the activity because it is a good place to start in terms of content (reviewing the reasons for government, the concept of and difficulties with democracy etc.) but also it acts as an icebreaker that isn't ""hokey"" and sets a good tone in terms of getting buy in from the students on classroom culture and expectations. I hand out the syllabus, but generally I just point out anything really important and tell them to read it."
highschoolteachers,"I’ve found some men to be the most cliquey I’ve ever encountered, like even pick their lunch up and walk away from a table if someone sat down. And the old boys’ club mentality is just as exclusive and destructive (I work in a high school)."
highschoolteachers,My favorite teacher in high school wore exclusively Converse high-tops. We're talking a dude in a suit with a ridiculous bowtie (a different one every day) and Chuck Taylors. He also collected Pez dispensers and had a weird obsession with knick-knacks of cat butts. That man was a legend at my school.
highschoolteachers,"Local law enforcement started doing drills in my high school after Columbine. It worked well, I thought."
highschoolteachers,"There is so much truth to this! I work at a small k-12 school and our elementary staff is very cliquish! I get along with all of them, but I can definitely tell I’m not a part of their clique. I teach junior high and high school. One year, I noticed my 7th graders were really struggling with writing. You could tell they were stuck at a 4th grade level, even my exceptional students. I brought it up as delicately as I could to our 5/6 teacher and all of the elementary staff went ballistic on me! They blamed it on the students, despite the kids admitting they never had any of their writing graded in 5th or 6th grade. The 5/6 teacher quit the following year and now all of the elementary staff bad mouth him. I don’t get it. Why not try to help them in the first place????"
highschoolteachers,"EXACTLY this.  

I am a male high school physics teacher with 11 years experience and I generally keep to myself.  But, it seems that the social dynamics of high school teachers is not that much different than the social dynamics of high school students.

It's always sort of been a ""chicken or the egg"" kind of problem to me:  Do people become high school teachers because they have that kind of mentality, or do they have that mentality because they are high school teachers?

But, I do see it even in myself.  In order to use the sort of soft coercion that is necessary on the day to day to get kids to do what you want, you have to know how to speak to them on their terms.  And well, doing that day in and day out has lasting, altering effects."
highschoolteachers,I stay out of the cliques. Just like in high school.
highschoolteachers,"I would not want someone with your mentality teaching my children. You will have children coming to you who do not see the value in what you are teaching and will feel exactly how you feel about this test. It will be their job to overcome their struggles, much as it is yours to complete basic certification requirements. Every teacher should be able to complete middle school level work in all subject areas. As a high school teacher, I routinely help students after school with work from classes that are not my own. Knowledge of all sorts is valuable to me, and this mindset is an important part of why I became a teacher. 

Certificated teachers everywhere have passed this test. I am sorry you have difficulties with math. Buckle down, pull some all nighters, and learn the content. Or please, find a new profession."
highschoolteachers,"I’m a high school special education teacher, and my biggest tip is to be as flexible as possible, and realize that nothing will ever go completely as planned, especially your first year. It’s a fun job, but the people who seem to struggle are the rigid types who might things personally, or are constantly high strung. Of course work hard, and do the best you can, but if you learn how to roll with the special education chaos and adapt accordingly that’ll be huge. 

Also with your kids, it’s all about building relationships and being positive. Have consequences for clear rule breaking (this will look different with individual kids and rules) but also tons of positivity and praise. Don’t baby talk, make it natural. If you have higher level resource kids, praise is still good but don’t make it dripping. Sincerity is the key."
highschoolteachers,"I taught one year in middle school and it was where the school readily hired me without full interview as I didn't have to give a lesson plan example or demo teach. I found teaching middle school was more about managing middle school age kids behaviorally than the content or academic teaching. I was told by my administration that no matter what happened every student would pass my class and go to high school. The students knew this so it created a lot of behavior management challenges as I could not encourage them to behave for a grade they didn't care about. 

I'm not worried about your ability to handle the academics. My concern would be if you would be comfortable with constantly managing the middle school behaviors and antics. Especially if this is at a needy school where there are lots of behavior issues that come from home."
highschoolteachers,"When they get to high school they will take advantage. They need to be trained to use their breaks now. I'm a high school teacher and we flat out don't allow students to go to the toilet in lessons. They will run around the corridors, vandalise things, kick classroom doors open, bang on windows and try to get their friends to come out with them... high school children cannot be in the corridors during lessons and it is frustrating that they come from primary school seemingly without the concept of using their breaks to actually go to the toilet."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school and I have a ton of posters in my room that reflect me. I have Marvel and GoT and Supernatural and HP plus other silly ones. Kids always comment on them. I’ve had quiet comments about kids liking the same stuff to loud discussions about the movies. It really creates a connection and helps them know who I am as a person.  

Something new I started last year was my icebreakers. I always did a small something bc I have 200+ students and I need to learn names. But last year I started mixing it up a bit. I had a ppt and each row of kids would answer a different ‘would you rather question’ or pick which thing they liked (coke v pepsi) or something like that. They said their name and their answer. It really helped all of us get to know each other better.  I kept it up for summer school and now I have a huge set of these questions to use for the new school year. 

I also write a letter to the kids at the start of the year. It has a lot of basic info about me, both as a kid in school and now as a grown up. They then have to write a letter back to me. It helps all of us learn more about each other. I make sure I read and comment on all the letters so the kids know I’m paying attention. It really helps build relationships too."
highschoolteachers,It's interesting to learn how districts and grade level differs for personnel. In my past experience the high school level was cliques while the elementary were more friendly. My high school experience ... Holy Fuck.
highschoolteachers,"The HS I student taught at used RTI. Teachers would split up into 4 groups (one for each grade level) to discuss students that were on the list for RTI. This made things difficult for teachers who taught more than one grade level (aka most teachers in the school) because sometimes they weren’t able to say their pieces about all RTI students they had that were on the list due to being in different grade levels. Other than that, it was a pretty good system. Counselors were good about revisiting certain students’ “cases” after a period of time to see if any interventions worked. If nothing the teachers did worked after that point, it would become an issue for admin to deal with. This particular school had just over 1000 students and I think it would be more difficult for schools that are much bigger than that because the whole RTI meeting process would be more complicated. I’d be interested to see how RTI works at an elementary level since I only had experience with high school."
highschoolteachers,"Actually I was a loner in high school. I was in a sorority but we were the sorority the whole campus made fun of because we were thought of as fat, ugly, and weird. Thanks for making assumptions about me with the purpose of trying to shame me, it proves my point that this whole conversation is hypocritical."
highschoolteachers,"You’re exactly right! My district has two elementary buildings, one K-3  and the other 4-6. The K-3 teachers are insufferable. It’s the same coffee-guzzling, Pinterest addicted, bubbly voice uptalk people that reinforce all the negative stereotypes. 

I hate when they talk to other teachers in the same tone they use for little kids. I dislike people babytalking to students of any age. I talk to my 5th graders with the same tone as I do with my middle and high school students. You can tell they appreciate not being talked down to."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; all the X people they’ve met are Y way and claim that you aren’t generalizing.

Who said ""ALL"" are one way or the other? The OP said the immature behavior came from ""*mostly*'' the elementary teachers. And that just began a conversation of teachers sharing their experiences saying ""oh yeah, I can relate to that.'' Even elementary teachers (myself included,) find ourselves nodding in agreement. But we also acknowledge that the conversation splits among age level and school demographics (e.g. suburban vs. urban.) No one here is making a statement that ""ALL elementary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" nor are they saying that ""ALL secondary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'' We're just sharing our collective experiences and observations. ""Hey, I noticed .... too."" 

I have had a lot of great interactions with secondary ed people and many of my friends are MS/ HS teachers (I kind of ride the middle line) and I think that many secondary ed people, and correct me if I'm wrong secondary ed people, get a little... *impatient* (this is probably the nicest way to put it 😂) with elementary education teachers (particularly the ones we're talking about.) And we even acknowledge on this Reddit that some HS teachers are cocky a-holes (see the other post about AP teachers.) But even then nobody is saying ""ALL secondary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'' If you want to make an observation about secondary ed people, feel free, and I'm sure you'll have people agreeing and disagreeing. Just like what's happening here. I could rant for days about my secondary gym teachers in middle and high school... ugh... 😡😡😡

And I'd even clarify that we're not talking about cliques being the problem (as in a group of people sharing similar interests, etc.) but the OP specifically referenced the clique BEHAVIOR (eye rolling and the disapproving facial expressions.) I mean we're basically talking about the movie ""Mean Girls'' here... ""YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US!'' 

People want to be around others who are similar as it gives them comfort to belong, but when they start exhibiting discriminatory behaviors, that's when it's a problem!"
highschoolteachers,"I would be willing to bet that you were popular when you were in high school, that you were in a sorority, and that you get really excited about new markers. 

There are tons of great elementary teachers! I have huge respect for them because I sure as shit wouldn’t want that job. But there are also tons of bad elementary teachers. And bad elementary teachers tend to fall into that type A sorority girl model. 

Similarly, there are both tons of good and tons of bad secondary teachers. However, the bad secondary teacher are less likely to be the peppy/sorority type, and more likely to be the lazy/apathetic/idgaf type. Is there some crossover? Sure. But we’re talking about trends here. 

Get off your high horse"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a career changer so I've worked in a lot of different non-education sectors and I've never known cliqueyness like I've experienced in elementary ed at any other place since high school. I have thought it was because teachers are all at the same level, competing for the same resources, while in an office, you're usually doing different jobs. But I didn't know it was considered more an elementary ed problem."
highschoolteachers,I think the clique thing comes from the fact that teachers from elementary and middle school are surrounded by it all day. Also I think a lot of teachers enjoy teaching because it reminds them of when they were that age. I had a few high school teachers who seemed to only be teachers because they liked being in the high school environment and the drama that comes with it
highschoolteachers,"It gets less and less common to see men as you go younger with the student population. I’d say our staff is pretty much 50/50 at the high school level. I’m not an administrator, but I’d love to see more male teachers hired at the elementary level."
highschoolteachers,"Sounds a lot like my district! The whole district is housed in one building because we are so small. Elementary teachers have all been there for at least a decade, their high school teacher is now the principal they work for, and they're the most negative group in the world.

Walk across the school to the middle / high portion, and we all get along fantastically. We have no clue why it happens, but specials teachers that move to our side full time always mention what a relief it is."
highschoolteachers,"I was a preschool teacher too and oh my God, the drama was a nightmare. Now I'm a high school teacher and all of us are like I'm stressed let's eat cake lol."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school teacher and don't experience this at all. I think we all have a ""misery loves company"" mindset. There are people I'm closer with than others (like my department), but that's usually just because of proximity. I like all my coworkers and they are all relatively chill and kind, I'm lucky."
highschoolteachers,Showing some genuine personality is key. Especially with high school students it makes a big difference.
highschoolteachers,"It is not the same everywhere but in my district there are the cliques and then there are the unintended cliques. For example, at the MS, all of the teachers who coach will sit at one table (male and female). They hang out together and as a group are very tight, even if they coach completely different sports. The rest have their own ""groups"" as well. Everyone gets along together but anytime there is a PD or downtime, they break out into the same groups.

At the HS, same thing but there it seems to be teachers group by departments and/or same age. There is a group of teachers at my high school who are all female and all around the same age. They do everything together and unintentionally make it clear they belong to this wonderful group and you don't. They will tell you there are no cliques and talk about how ""everyone gets along great!"" While ignoring everyone else who is older, younger, or isn't in their group.

I don't go to the elementary so can't really speak about them except to say it seems there is always a lot of gossip from teachers coming from those schools about each other."
highschoolteachers,"This comment is kind of proving their point. At no time did the previous poster say that all elementary teacher are like that, just that some of them definitely are, and it’s a trend that more that just one person has picked up on. By no means is anybody saying that only elementary teacher have problems, either. For high school teachers, apathy and laziness are the recurring bad traits (as opposed to peppy clique-y-ness). You can feel all high and mighty being offended if you want to, but really that’s a big part of what OP’s complaints are about."
highschoolteachers,Some say high school never ends.
highschoolteachers,"People tell me that it must be great having summers off and having great pay and how easy my job is and .... and I respond with

""Did you like high school when you were in high school?"" 

Most people respond, ""Hell no.""

And I respond, ""I've been in high school for 20 years now."" 

And then it dawns on them that I've been in hell for 20 years. 

It doesn't get better. It's high school. But I've learned how to navigate it."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, I've seen it some, but my time in elementary school as a long-term sub opened my eyes to just how cliquey and dramatic teachers can be."
highschoolteachers,"You’ve probably already tried this, but this is my way of working around trouble:

I always try to get to know the ones who are really defiant. I teach high school, but any kid who is acting out or talking back, I just really zero in on during their free time and ask what they’re doing/ drawing/ listening to, if they’re doing something else instead of their class work. I don’t get on to them right away. We might have a little chat about it and then I’ll get to the, “Well, I really think that’s cool, but I really need you to work on your classwork first”, etc. Once they see that you care, sometimes they’re more likely to listen. If they’re just being defiant, maybe pick something from their clothing, backpack, lunchbox, etc that you can start a conversation with. I’m not 100% sure how it will translate to the littles, but maybe just giving the trouble makers a little extra attention might help them warm up to you? Not special treatment or anything. 

If they talk out or say “no”, maybe ask why or what they think is more important right now without derailing the class."
highschoolteachers,I just came back from a new teachers meet (198 of us) and the Elementary teachers were brats. They were snobby narcissistic creatures and I feel bad for the little children. The middle school and high school teachers were pretty chill.
highschoolteachers,"It is wayyy worse at a middle school level, especially as a male teacher. Hate to say it, but I noticed a lot of anti-male sexism against male teachers at the junior high level. When I switched to high school, had that problem, but they were a minority. As an ELA teacher, I started hanging with the other art teachers as well as the history teachers. It was a HUGE change for the better."
highschoolteachers,Welcome to education. While some people I’ve gotten into the profession to be the educator they needed growing up some people do it because they never left high school in life...
highschoolteachers,I have both certifications. I found the 7-12 more difficult only because of the literary analysis essay. I had not done one of those since high school and felt very rusty! I still passed but it was definitely more challenging for me. If you’re definitely set on High school ELAR then you have to take it. If you’d be okay with middle school I’d go 4-8. You’re more likely to end up in a middle school position. I found there was more demand for 6-8 than 4-5. Elementary schools tend to favor EC-6 certifications because there’s a lot of movement year to year because of enrollment numbers so for example it’s an advantage if they can move people from 5th to 3rd without worrying about the teachers certs.
highschoolteachers,Maybe not at a high school level but elementary and maybe even middle school teachers certainly are responsible for teaching social-emotional behavior management.
highschoolteachers,"as a high school teacher, i can confirm all of us have completely given up and have a weird, unspoken solidarity because we put up with angsty, bratty, and sometimes just plain stupid teenagers every day. the only clique among HS teachers is suffering."
highschoolteachers,"Yes. So this would mean you’re a freshman in high school. This is often the time when students decide if education is for them or not.

Here’s a good way of thinking about it: assume that school is like a relationship. You need to devote time and effort into making it work. Just like a good relationship you get out of it what you put into it. If you are driven, innovative, adaptive, cheerful and focused it makes it easy to care about you and your stated goals.

So let me give you a piece of advice. Attend class every day, give your best, get enough sleep and use every opportunity to show that your education is important to you.

I 100 percent guarantee that your teachers will notice this and they will look out for you. You do this and you validate how hard they are all working for you.

Good luck this school year my man."
highschoolteachers,This is anecdotal but I experienced this at both middle schools I worked at. Never experienced it at the high school level and I’ve worked at 5 (soon to be 6) high schools in 4 districts in 2 states.
highschoolteachers,"Depends on whether our pay is based off your grades...

Half kidding, we don't put all that effort in to watch you not graduate high school. We want you to get what you deserve, and what you deserve is massively dependent on the effort you put in. If we feel your grades fall short of that, then we feel disappointed for you because we've seen the effort you put. Likewise, if we see you thrive and massively exceed your expectations because of your hard work (and our guidance) we feel just as much pride as you do."
highschoolteachers,"We have the exact situation, but the kid has gotten to high school without a filter, and decided that the best use of his time was to address the biggest, blackest gang member in the school the n word. 
Luckily, staff intervened, but sometimes you just want to let nature take its course."
highschoolteachers,I left teaching at the high school level. I teach social studies and it is super common (at least where I am) for coaches to teach social studies.
highschoolteachers,"Nice, congrats! PE teacher here also. You spend any time this summer updating your curriculum to hit the needs and interest of your middle schoolers now? I have experience at all 3 levels (elem, middle, high school). I’d have to say middle was my favorite age to teach. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science in a private catholic school. I taugh abroad as a post grad volunteer, but don't have a education degree nor formal training. Do have a couple bachelors degrees. Starting my 6th year full time. School is pretty prestigious.

How things like this go varies by state and school... my situation isn't unique in my school or those like them.  Best of luck in your search and journey!"
highschoolteachers,"FWIW, and I hope folks can contradict me, but of the dozen or so high school teachers I know who have worked at various charter schools near me in New England, not one had a positive experience and left as soon as possible, a few right in the middle of the year. Their schools also had tremendous staff turnover rates.

Lower pay, huge variety of classes, no guaranteed prep time, longer days, the stuff that public school unions can provide. 

But there have to be charter schools out there doing it right! I hope you found one! And if not, I hope you get into a public school ASAP :)

My judgment is that it is absolutely not wrong to keep applying. I know a lot of folks will disagree. But a very wise admin once told me to have loyalty to the job, not the building."
highschoolteachers,"I used to do private tutoring for high schoolers in my subject area (I teach middle school) but stopped when I got pregnant. It was good money, relatively easy and pretty fun. I miss it sometimes but maybe I'll pick it up again when my daughter is older."
highschoolteachers,"I’m a 30 year old male and was just accepted into Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi where I hope to finish my bachelors degree and utilize their teaching program. I’d like to be a high school science teacher. People keep saying “They’re hurting for male teachers and science teachers. You’ll get a job no problem!” Is this true?

Also, my Wife is in the military so we’ll be moving every 4 years or so. Do you see this posing a problem?"
highschoolteachers,"In high school that’s possibly more true but in elementary school I think we have to do a lot more of that social/emotional management. If we sent a kid to the counselor every time they had a social/emotional crisis, they’d never be in the classroom."
highschoolteachers,"Yes, I started out with 2 levels, but now I'm exclusively teaching just German 2 along with 2 ESL levels. I hope other languages get to have the recognition they deserve but currently it's tough because they don't get the support at the middle school level that they need for kids to want to take them at the high school level. I'm honestly surprised German isn't on the rise considering the connections between STEM and German companies. ESL seems to be a national need, but it really depends on the area you want to live and work in. Bigger cities have higher ESL populations, and rural areas can have almost none. Or in my case, semi-rural with a growing population and very few good ideas as to how to build a district program 🙃"
highschoolteachers,"Dear god, this is one of the reasons I left high school teaching. The football coaches and the stupid packets of worksheets they gave to their classes. 

Not all coaches phone it in, but enough do that it is irritating."
highschoolteachers,"Last year I had a student die when he was playing with a gun with his best friend. 

Two years before that I had a student get murdered by her boyfriend.

I teach high school in an urban area and it seems like each year really poor choices impact my kids in life changing ways. It breaks my heart. 

This is often the part of teaching people don’t talk about. It never gets easier."
highschoolteachers,"Seattle-area born and raised, glad you're looking to move here! 

The Puget Sound is a weird mix of massive schools and smaller rural ones, as the metropolitan sprawl is blocked by mountains, islands, and rivers. There are high schools of thousands just fifteen miles from a high school of 400.

For that reason, most of the smaller population districts hire PhysEd teachers who can also teach other subjects, like history or computer science. It helps give, for example, Sultan students the same variety of classes students in Snohomish or Bellevue might have access to. 

Definitely get your foot in the door through subbing if you can, or be willing to take a part time position. The further outside King County you're willing to go, the better the opportunities - and better cost of living. I mentioned Snohomish and Sultan, but Lakewood and Tacoma are also nice, and Bellingham is a dream. Granite Falls is improving every day. 

Difficult districts to teach in would probably be Renton and Tukwila, and Everett is hit or miss. My only big warning would be Marysville. Marysville is notoriously awful for teachers, students, and parents; administration is impossible to deal with and there is little effort to meet the needs of students with disabilities. 

Another option would be to teach in sunny Eastern WA for a couple years then make the move to rainy Western WA. They honestly feel like two different states. Eastern WA has been growing in recent years with increasing demand for teachers. Cities like Wenatchee and Spokane are really affordable and nice places to live, but you'll definitely miss the ocean!"
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher I originally read this and though”oh, your kids are on the track team. That’s cool I guess.” 

It amazes me the stuff you elementary teachers have to deal with!

Keep up the good work so we don’t have to by the time they get to high school!"
highschoolteachers,"So aside from the quite flagrant sexism you are at the tail end of the problem and this is not something you can fix by ""changing"" the way english is taught to boys. I presume you are a high school/middle school english teacher. The problem starts in elementary with the ""if you don't get a school subject its okay because you can just do sports"" mentality and spirals out of control from there. 

Your ideas while noble will further polarize the issue not to mention blackball you with female students and parents as ""the teacher who only cares about boys"""
highschoolteachers,"I was doing something wrong. 
Was first yr high school, 3 90min classes 1 prep each day. I could end up lesson planning from 6am, school starts at 815 ends at 2pm (last class was prep) and I would start lesson planning again from 2pm-8pm. 
It killed me"
highschoolteachers,"We are using it for advisory. Now my students can do all those “what’s your future job?” quizzes online instead of on paper. I think it’s useful for keeping better track of whether they did the dang thing or not, especially when advisory is worth a half credit for their high school career and it’s based on completion. No more hunting down papers and doing a checklist!

I have no idea how it’d be used in a different content area though."
highschoolteachers,"I’m a 30 year old male and was just accepted into Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi where I hope to finish my bachelors degree and utilize their teaching program. I’d like to be a high school science teacher. People keep saying “They’re hurting for male teachers and science teachers. You’ll get a job no problem!” Is this true?

Also, my Wife is in the military so we’ll be moving every 4 years or so. Do you see this posing a problem?"
highschoolteachers,"Nope, high school.  I .PDF every student's test who failed and send the file to their parents."
highschoolteachers,"They sent me to one year of Catholic school (8th grade) b/c I spent most of 7th grade crying at home. They put me back in public school for high school because I spent 8th grade arguing with teachers and railing against snobby peers.

ETA: 

Much of it I didn't tell them. It was actually a shock that they sent me to Catholic school for that one year, because we didn't have the money to send elsewhere. I suspect a good deal of financial aid went into it, as well as the volunteer work my parents did thay year."
highschoolteachers,"Biggest is 30, smallest is 25. I do the best I can to manage it, but when there is so many of them and only one of me, it is a struggle. Unfortunately I teach just freshman who are just starting their high school experience, and we are on our own campus before they transition to 10-12th grade. Even if they fail me they can go to summer school or credit recovery if they pay, or they just have to retake the course every year until they pass up to 12th grade. 

I do my best to incorporate student interests, from making custom student playlists for music to work to, making projects relevant (from student choice to specific items like jordan shoes), and relating what we're doing to how they can use it in the real world.

I hate to think they're not my problem anymore, because then another group of apathetic students take their place. I wish their was a way to make peace with this, but I know it's unrealistic to expect every student to be interested or want to learn. Yet my brain still tries to do the gymnastics anyway."
highschoolteachers,"My district did this when I was a kid. It had...flaws.

Kids from the ""whiter"" side of town were bussed into the city for only three years of the 13 years of schooling. The remaining time, we stayed and the kids from the city came to us. So, they spent a significantly disproportionate amount of time riding the bus.

Other than deciding to mix the kids together, there was zero social support within the schools and they were extremely segregated, both racially and socioeconomically.

The year I graduated from high school, they stopped bussing, initiated school choice, and a ton of charter schools opened. The school district I attended is now considered extremely poor, has severe underpopulation problems due to white flight to other opportunities, and is in danger of closing schools.

Thoughts on it all? If done well, with significant socio-cultural supports, it could be a boon for the community. If done like it was when I grew up, it will be a huge bust and cause bigger problems.

However, I learned a lot about the real world because of it. Most I wasn't ready for. Today's parents would rip their kids out of schools like I was in so fast that the people next to them would have whiplash. I had my first pregnant peer when in 5th grade. In 7th grade, the boy I sat next to in science saw both of his parents murdered and still came to school the next day. We learned to never sit on the ground at recess because there was a chance of used needles being there. Three kids committed suicide in 6th grade.

It took me close to 30 years to process a lot of the background of my middle years education, which is fucking sad because I was a spectator in the horrid lives of others, but I do think it has made me a much better human overall. It certainly makes me a better teacher."
highschoolteachers,"Can you issue failing grades to the students who don't work? I teach high school electives/non-core, and that's how I give feedback when conversations, parents, and discipline don't work. The second the zero hits the grade book, they mysteriously become interested in what they should be doing. Plus, it communicates to them that I don't give more of a shit about their work than they do. Don't do the work, carry the zero on the day; if that is acceptable for you, then fine. But like, if it is raining and you go out without your umbrella, you will get wet, and if that's okay with you, then enjoy your soggy walk home."
highschoolteachers,"Check out SHEG activities for your lower class. I think the activities are great but the readings are for middle-early high school, but I use them with ELLs and my lowest level classes all the time. It modifies the important historical documents, walks you through getting the main idea, helps you figure out context, includes pre-reading activities, etc. 

"
highschoolteachers,"I've only been at this 9 years so it's not like I have decades of wizened experience to share, but here are my thoughts. I have always been a high achiever: valedictorian in high school, summa cum laude at university, teacher of the year, state academic UIL teams, etc. I only mention this to say that I simply do not understand, at a fundamental level, the lack of interest most students have in anything school related; that type of attitude is completely opposite of everything I value. My first few years of teaching were quite the wake up call; I realized that my views of school were shared by, at most, about 5 kids all day. I have great classes; as you described they are obedient, don't cause any trouble, and strive to do well enough to keep parents, coaches, sponsors, etc. off their back. At the same time, they would be perfectly happy if we didn't do anything. There are always 5 at the bottom who need to be threatened almost daily. 

&amp;#x200B;

After coming to terms with reality, I resolved two things. First of all, I am not going to stress over a student's work any more than they are; if they're not concerned, I'm not going to lose sleep. I want every student to *want* to do well, but that's not realistic. I try to make lessons as interesting as possible, keep students as involved as possible, and help them in every way that I can. I give a every student a new chance every single day. I won't give up on a student, but I won't get any more worked up than they do. Much like you, I tend to gravitate toward the students that work hard and want to do well. There is always the rare student that you have a dramatic impact on; but in my experience, and that of others I teach with, it just doesn't happen as often as the movies would have you believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I prioritize my time in class. If Johnny is working incredibly hard and wants to master the material, I'm going to spend more time with him than little Steven that just wants to be left alone. I won't allow Steven to be off task, but as long as he's at least pretending to work and not disrupting class, I'm good. Steven may never use chemistry, but Johnny certainly will. Year after year, I am emailed by former Johnny's thanking me for preparing them for college; I have a folder full of letters and emails that affirms my decision to focus on students that want to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

My other resolution was to take a larger perspective. Most of the Steven's truly feel they'll never use chemistry, but then they get out of high school, start looking into careers and all of a sudden chemistry is a prerequisite. I can at least know that even if Steven didn't care as a 15 year old, I did everything I could to prepare him no matter how hard he resisted. So, in every instance I try to think to myself ""Okay, he's an apathetic jerk now, but maybe in 5-10 years when he lands in a college chemistry class he'll appreciate the fact he knows stoichiometry."" 

&amp;#x200B;

My advice is to do carry out your professional responsibilities to the best of your ability and remember that you're the adult with perspective and they are not. They may not appreciate you now, or ever, but I never want a student to look back at my classes and think ""man, I wish that guy had taught me something."" The teachers that give up and give in to students are awful cool to a 15 year old, but much less so later in life when they are sitting in remedial classes. "
highschoolteachers,If he is in 9th grade and hasn’t been on an IEP before this is super strange. A lot of high school kids start smoking dope before school and get very stupid. Maybe he’s got a brain tumor. But I’ve never had a kid in 36 years of teaching that could do great on a Kahoots  quiz but then not be able to answer a single question on a test. Something is wrong here. 
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English and use Google Classroom for homework/essays.  If they do in-class writing, we use Chromebooks.  Honestly, that's about it.   I'm in an excellent school district, for context."
highschoolteachers,"I don't know what age group you teach but elementary school kids especially have ALWAYS wanted to share unrelated stories or snap off smart comments/opinions. I remember when I was in 4th grade in 2001 my teacher literally had to allocate a ""story sharing time"" during the day because all of us would always raise our hands to share something barely related to what was being taught.

Also high school kids don't use Facebook because ""it's for old people""."
highschoolteachers,You didn't like science in high school. You have no education background. You barely took any science classes in college. I think you know the answer here. 
highschoolteachers,"I would rather teach them the power of choices and consequences. Seems like a lesson that's better to learn when they are in high school rather than when they are paying thousands for their college education or their job is on the line.

Plus, once they miss a couple and realize their grade is greatly suffering, the ones for whom there is any hope understand that they gotta get it done to pass the course.

"
highschoolteachers,"Does the principal mean on their on devices as far as the music rule?  When they did that at the high school I taught at, I went out and bought a nice big stereo for the classroom. We couldn’t listen to their favorite rap music unfortunately, but the students still appreciated the compromise and my legal way of getting around the rule. "
highschoolteachers,"I personally carry the game Math Dice Chase for such emergencies.

Some other suggestions:

1. Kahoot (if it's allowed). I usually play a couple that relate to their academic subject, then let the winner choose one, it can be whatever. (This might not work well in classes that have a history of making inappropriate choices.)

2. Team vocabulary review with fly swatters. Kids make two teams them make two lines while teacher writes vocab words spaced over the entire whiteboard. To play, one student from each team goes forward and stands with their back to the whiteboard, with a fly swatter in hand . Teacher reads a definition, and students turn around and slap their swatter over the correct word. First one gets a point for their team. Thise students hand their swatter to the next student on their team andgo to the back of their love. The next students step forward and rinse, repeat. If there's time, go through the words twice. (This could also be done with math facts, ie times tables.)

3. Teachers Pay Teachers. I know there is some hate on here for that site. But a few dollars for a peaceful and fun class period is soooo worth it.

4. Play a trivia game or take a quiz using Plickers. You can hand the student cards out randomly and have kids write their names on the back, then collect them at the end, in order to keep record of their answers.

5. Look online for other ideas for learning games to play with the students.

If the teacher doesn't leave me homework to assign, then I assume nobody is going to do any homework I assign. Because why would they? Use candy and/or stickers to reward. Even high school students like stickers, especially if they're smelly stickers.

If the regular teacher doesn't bother to leave lesson plans for the sub, they have no room to complain about what does happen in their classroom when a sub is there. Next time, maybe they'll leave lesson plans. If this is due to there being no regular teacher available, then admin needs to step up and provide lesson plans. Otherwise, they have no room to complain, either.

Research supports the use of games in the classroom: https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1046878192233001"
highschoolteachers,"YES! They will not shut up and its driving me nuts.We're talking upper high school. I've told them dozens of times they don't need to announce every though that comes into their head.Also, tired of them constantly insulting each other and am worn out from constantly shutting it down."
highschoolteachers,"I teach grammar everyday - foreign language grammar, but I go more in-depth than most English classes due to the nature of language.  I just use ridiculously silly examples and really dumb clipart.  

""With the fries having been callously eaten by the monster, the Hero of Potatoes vowed to avenge his people.""

Then have potatoe related clipart.  Or clipart of Oreos or something completely irrelevant to make the kids wonder what is a wrong with me.  

Then I'd continue the saga of the Potatoe Hero, ending with him joining forces with the monster after learning about the monster's tragic past.

Meanwhile, cold calling students to identify certain grammatical structures in the sentences and usually making it competitive to see which side of the room could get the most questions right.

I teach high school."
highschoolteachers,"I don’t want to get into an argument with anyone here about this, though I’m sure I’ll end up getting a lecture from someone anyway. I think some context is important. I don’t necessarily disagree with him, depending on the situation. I teach high school and I have passed many students who have not met curriculum just because there are other goals beyond school. I have obviously failed a lot too, but I do think about the student and their situation before I make the call of giving them a 50 or a 45.

I had one guy who was 16 and failed grade 9 math three times. No where close to meeting the curriculum as he is just that far behind in math. He needs insane remedial help that the school system can’t provide.

What’s the value in failing him again? A 50 is as good as a fail...it basically tells everyone (including the student, who is already aware of this), that they don’t get the subject and aren’t prepared for the next level. However they don’t need to do it again.

Same could perhaps be said for the students you’re talking about. I don’t always see the value in failing. Summer school is a joke. If you’re failing and you’re coming to class, chances are you have learning gaps that 40 hours in an I air conditioned room with 30 other kids won’t fix.

And many students do give up because they think they’re worthless. Working with one right now who has experienced repeated failures and is years behind. He has other skills not measured in courses (employability, social, etc). He wants to do construction work. He doesn’t need to understand what an ecosystem is to do that. Why hold him back?

That coach could be thinking like that. You can’t entirely discount the kind of youth work that can be done by a good coach. He may be advocating for students he connects with who he is helping improve in ways that school just doesn’t measure.

He also has no authority. He’s your peer and he’s advocating. You answer to the principals. Any teacher could disagree with him and do otherwise."
highschoolteachers,If only the floor is lava worked with high school kids...
highschoolteachers,"I would strongly recommend not majoring in education.

Major in something that is more markettable as plan B and get minor in education.

You can become a teacher while majored in something else.  And, If you are going for secondary education, especialyl high school, your job prospect might actually better that way.  Some principles prefer to hire someone who was majored in English / Science / Social Studies and either have minor in education or went through alternative route.  

On the other hand, you cannot become anything else with education major alone."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for this. I think the key is to not take any of it personally... which is much easier said than done. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed that admin can treat teachers the same way that some teachers treat students, in that they focus on the negatives, the deficits, all of the things that are not happening, or that are happening but are wrong. Of course, this mindset is a recipe for burnout and frustration... if you take it personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you remind yourself that you are trying your best, that failure is the best teacher, that every day is a new day, that you're dedicated to improving your craft day by day, week by week, year by year while also recognizing how important it is to take care of yourself in this very demanding job... then you should be good.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently serving my first year as a high school social studies teacher. Though it's not my first year as an educator, it is my first experience in a traditional teaching job, so it might as well be my first year. I'm learning to go with the flow, to recognize that every day is a different day, that I'm an imperfect human doing my best because I genuinely care about my students and their well-being. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I recognize that I have much growth to do as a professional, I also recognize that there are some challenges that are beyond my control; some days, students arrive ready to learn. Other days, they arrive ready to fight. I try to maintain a consistent tone regardless; my hope is that this consistent kindness and calmness will have a positive impact in the long term. "
highschoolteachers,"Extremely difficult if you actually want them to learn something in the process. I teach high school math, and there have been several times where i have tried creative and supposedly “engaging” PBLs, but sometimes kids are just determined to hate math. I did an activity not too long ago for our correlations unit where the students had to guess the ages of celebrities, and then compare them with their actual ages in order to identify a correlation. While we were looking at celebrity pictures all of the students had a blast, literally every single kid was engaged, I thought “boo-yah, i’m an awesome teacher!” But then when they had to graph the points and discuss the questions, no one gave a crap. Sure they had a blast initially, and they might remember that day, but what the heck did they learn?"
highschoolteachers,"Just out of curiosity. Are you being picky with the districts you will and will not apply to? Not sure where you are geographically in the state, but cities like Newark, Paterson, and Camden are often looking and pretty desperate to hire. Sometimes to get into the field one has to take the less than desirable district (I grew up in Paterson so don’t even come at me for calling it less than desirable, thanks). Are you willing to relocate within in the state? This can help you cast a wider net. Lastly, I’ll leave you with the words of a past professor of mine “congratulations on choosing to teach History, it’s the best subject to teach, once you are able to secure a position, high school and college history jobs are hard to come by, we like to die teaching history.” Best of luck, I know there’s something out there for you in our great state. "
highschoolteachers,This is very true. As a high school physics teacher it's always because they don't really try. They have no stamina. I generally start asking question about the subject to test their knowledge and explain where they can get the information. Don't just give it to them. Also most of the time I have to take away their negative energy first before they really start to listen. Just mentioning their negative energy and saying they can't learn like that is mostly enough.
highschoolteachers,"Very nice! I just started subbing back in August myself, so we’re more or less in the same boat. Middle schoolers are definitely weird, and have forced me to say things like, “don’t eat the wite-out, give it to me” and “dabbing is banned - no more dabbing in class.” They also like to hit each other and throw things more than high school students do, likely because the high schoolers are to busy looking at Snapstagrambookspace. I’ve also found that deliberately misusing their slang is a good way to get a few cheesy laughs/groans and build some semblance of rapport, but I also tell them that I wield Saturdays like a vengeful Hindu deity and will destroy theirs if they misbehave. 

Still, stick it out. Once you work a few days at each site, the kids will start to know you and will say hi when they see you in the halls and rejoice when they walk into class and see you. It’s a good feeling... up until the point where they start misbehaving. "
highschoolteachers,"I used to be an elementary teacher and I once worked with an administrator who told me not to waste my time with remediation because the kids in question were ""statistically insignificant."" This was the last year I ever taught at the elementary level. After 17 years I just hung up my teaching certificate and walked way from this job. 

A few years have passed. During the interim, I went to culinary school. After graduating with honors, I spent a few years in the food service industry and returned to education 12 years ago as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program. 

I'm a lot happier now that I don't have to worry about a teach to the test mentality. Since I work with food, my students are motivated to be in the kitchen ... so I have less disciplinary problems than other teachers. 

Grading is usually a cinch. The product was either properly made or it wasn't. It's either presentable or it's not. The work stations are either clean or they're not. 

Here are some options that you might want to consider.

1) Use your teaching certificate to travel abroad. I'm a product of the international American schools. I also spent 8 years during my elementary career teaching abroad. There are lots of American schools overseas. In addition to teaching locals, they serve the educational needs of dependents of State Department personnel, business people, and missionaries.  If you're interested in teaching abroad, check out [https://www.iss.edu/Home](https://www.iss.edu/Home)

2) Consider moving on. Find a school with a principal you can live with. I know that moving on can be hard but sometimes you have to do what's best for you.  

Most teachers spend a lot of time on their respective jobs. What's the point of doing this if you're not happy?

highschoolteachers,"Come to Ontario, Canada, where all the high school students are begging for standardized testing because inflation means some schools hand out 100s like candy and others have far tougher marking. Going to one school might give you an admissions edge over going to another.


A trend I observed when I was a student was people leaving my school for expensive private school since they were known to hand out better grades. Lack of standardization is a nightmare for fairness in admissions."
highschoolteachers,5 pages in 2 or 3 hours? Are you being realistic? Is that what you expect from a high school student? As a college student I’m given more than 1 week to write a 5 page essay. Please understand that high school students are not you and this is high school not college. 
highschoolteachers,"Every time I’ve done Teacher Appreciation, I’ve run it through student council. They tend to have a decent pulse on the school, on what the teachers like, etc. 

My experience is with high school, so I can’t speak for elementary or middle school teachers. I put together a cool thing with them last year that required a shit ton of work, but ended up being awesome. I surveyed the teachers to find out where they graduated from and contacted the alumni departments of all the universities seeking donated gifts. Each teacher got a gift bag with supplies and gifts from their alma mater. It was a cool way to talk with our students about college, too, and why we chose the schools we did. 

I personally think a discount would be better, but I’ll be honest— some people won’t use it. If it requires work on their end, it doesn’t feel like “appreciation” the way free stuff does! Not that I’ll sneeze at a discount when it’s for something I want or need, but I won’t go out of my way to get limited-time things like that. What teachers appreciate when being appreciated is time— my best teacher appreciation gift was my principal coming in, taking over my class for 15-20 minutes, handing me a cupcake and a soda, and telling me to just take a break. We like to be fed, sugared, and given a chance to step away from the classroom for something other than microwaving our lunch or peeing between classes 😂"
highschoolteachers,"My elementary school burned to the ground from a crazed arsonist.  I had already graduated high school at the time.  They caught the guy, and it was over the summer so they moved the school to a vacant school in the city."
highschoolteachers,Yeah I'm high school :/ But I do appreciate what you say about not expecting much work to get done. I think I put too much pressure on myself that they get the work done. I sub at my old highschool so I feel like I can't let these teachers that know me down
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I'm honestly more worried for the sanity of the guest teacher and safety for everyone involved when I'm gone and can deal with consequences/no work done/other fall out when I return.  I don't expect a sub to discipline my most difficult kiddos when it's hard to get authority with a well-behaved class, and I put in my notes that if a student ignores a warning/redirect to just leave a note for a minor infraction or call the office for a major, not to engage further with the kid. 

My very honest example of how to get them to behave for a sub is bribery, although this works well at my age (elementary/lots of candy and extra recess) and probably falls flat at the high school level. "
highschoolteachers,"I was like this in high school. I actually had a friend sit me down and tell me I needed to learn to say no, and we would practice. Throughout the year random people would ask me to do things, and she would ""monitor"" whether or not I said no. Sounds really weird, but it worked. I stopped letting people walk all over me. 

Now I have no shame and just say ""no I don't have time for that."" or ""no I'm focusing on something else right now."" or simply ""no thank you"" and walk away. I haven't done a single extra duty/task/PD/whatever this year. Not one. My classroom life is incredible. I grade everything on time, I've developed relationships with my students, I have completely planned out my unit out for rest of the semester (in a new subject I've never taught), I'm less stressed, AND there's significantly less drama in my life. Seriously. Just say no. "
highschoolteachers,"Quarter one ended yesterday. The freshman class, who have not adjusted well to high school life, have been emailing me all day about what they can do to get their grades up. They're especially upset when I tell them to try harder when they take the class next year.

But one is downright impressive with his persistence and hope to find the secret. He didn't do or turn in literally half of the assignments, skipped his final essay, and turned in a completely blank final exam (with a study guide and notecard to use on the test). He showed up to Friday school determined to pass my class-- despite the fact I told him it's impossible because he has a 28%. Where was this dedication these last 9 weeks?"
highschoolteachers,"Unless the kid is affecting your ability to teach the class, let the “talking behind your back” go. I assume this is high school? That’s just one of those things that’s going to happen.

In terms of whining about deadlines, that’s your job and your decision. They can whine all they want, but you have the authority, and they need to remember that. Assert your authority and shut down the complaints.

The screenshot concerns me slightly- why did you have access to a group chat between students?"
highschoolteachers,"I adjuncted for years in grad school while earning my two STEM master's degrees. Now I teach high school physics and chemistry. Teaching in college was somewhere between 10 and 8,338 times easier and less stressful. Care to revise your statement?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, fuck you."
highschoolteachers,"I was an unruly high school freshman. I was fortunate to develop the empathy to realize what I put my teachers through, and corrected my ways during the second half of my high school years. Over a decade later, I'm still friends with a lot of those teachers and view some of them as my adopted parents. They cared for me even when I acted a fool, they pushed me to be better even when I didn't want to be pushed, and they were there for me when times at home were tough. Teachers do not get the respect their position and responsibilities deserve. The first thing I do when I'm visiting my home town is see my parents, the second thing I do is go visit my adopted parents and give them a hug and tell them how I'm doing."
highschoolteachers,"You're conflating technical skill with work environment.  Take for example an electrician vs. an electrician teacher (in a high school vocational class, for example).  Both have the same technical ability (electrician), but is the electrician really going to dump 30% of their salary, forfeit the ability to earn overtime, and hop into a classroom with 30 kids just to see who doesn't stick their finger in a light socket first, in addition to now having to take all of their technical skill and adapt it into lesson plans, produce classroom management systems, attend IEP/504 meetings, perform hall duty, attend evening extracurriculars (at no pay, I might add), chaperone dances, coach a club (for $100 a semester, woo!), oh, and be evaluated on the basis of student English and Math testing scores, despite teaching neither of those skills directly?

I'm a HS engineering teacher and former mechanical engineer, and the entire system is set up for maximum bullshit.  The only thing that keeps me in the system is that I have a summer engineering job that pays the same amount in 2 months as I make in 7 months of teaching.  99.9% of other teachers can't get that good of a gig, and have to take minimum wage jobs."
highschoolteachers,"It really depends on the school. My high school had a workout room that was open to staff and students before and after school. Other schools might not be for it though. 

Definitely ask someone before you try to go in there the first time. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm almost 30 and still have this issue. Shorter than most students, and look young. My face, and neck also get very red, very easy, and I am also soft spoken.

I remember once being told by kindergartners that I'm not old enough to be their teacher. I only sub high school now, they are ussually more forgiving.

I always try to dress professionally. But the main thing I have found that helps, is becoming a regular at certain schools. Kids and staff recognize you, and get to know you a bit. They realize over time that you are just another teacher, with quirks like any other person. I think anyway. I have two schools I have become quite comfortable at. "
highschoolteachers,"I was in the second category in high school. I would get so overwhelmed with the matieral that it felt like I didn't understand any of it. I understood bits and pieces but just needed help putting it in order and filling in the gaps. But I didn't know how to say that. I would just say ""I don't understand any of this""."
highschoolteachers,"I had a friend from high school say to me during college she “wished” she was an education major because finance is so much harder. Now after we both graduated college she always says, “You’re so lucky to have summers off!!” Or “you get off at 3 though.”   She’s not really my friend anymore for this reason.   She thinks that because I teach 6 year olds my job isn’t hard.  "
highschoolteachers,"GAH, 32k is almost nothing though. I'm currently paid 22k as a grad student for teaching *one* college class per term (including summer). And that *one* college class has ~30-35 people at most and meets 4 hours a week for ten weeks. And I am not supposed to talk to their parents! It's so much less stress! Never going back to high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I haven’t been teaching long enough to speak on trends but I can offer an anecdote.  Last year, our admin introduced a new lunch system.  Instead of an extra long class period with classes dismissing at different times to eat, we have a extra long period where all students eat and sort of “office hours” for teachers.  Last year, most of our students used it as a time to sort of recharge mid-day.  I never had a single student come to my office hours, but the attitude and engagement in that 5th hour (which had previous eaten last lunch and was no eating before coming to my class) was night and day.  Other teachers reported similar results, with some actually having students come in for help.  This was consistent with teachers who taught all levels, seniors to freshmen, though unsurprisingly, the freshmen were less likely to look for help.

This year, while the seniors-sophomores are actually using the time pretty well, better than last year certainly, the freshmen use it like recess.  We literally have freshman running through the halls shrieking.  And not just one or two, this is large gangs of them.  Our old crotchety union-rep now spends most of his office hours standing outside his door keeping these monkeys from injuring themselves and others and yelling at them to act their age.  Freshmen teachers have reported similar things in class.  This cohort is just, as a whole, ridiculously immature.  

Freshmen are always going to be the most immature of high schoolers, but this group is beyond normal.  The last couple of years were nowhere near this.  Our school is relatively small (400ish students) and socializing between classes is the norm (this has always seemed strange to me, coming from my high school experience with ~600 in my class alone, and my student teaching, which was even larger than my high school).  Seniors dating sophomores, bffs in different grades, etc.  This year, the seniors, juniors, and sophomores refuse to associate with the freshmen.  Like, at all.  It’s pretty telling how cut off the freshmen are.

I have no idea if this is a trend, I really hope it isn’t and this class is just a one off.  But we hear from the junior high that the class 2 years behind them is worse."
highschoolteachers,"Last year i was a special education teacher it was great until they took away my curriculum and changed it to aba style curriculum and teaching my kids lost a lot is skill since aba doesn’t focus on writing, math, or lifestyle skills..... either way i loved it but no teacher really in my district besides high school (maybe) is teaching what they like. You are put where you are needed and sometimes are teaching subjects you yourself don’t desire to. "
highschoolteachers,"That I caused a terrible car accident that hurt people when I was a teenager and driving carelessly.  I want them to see that  big consequences can come from a small error but, also, that  some functional adults made terrible errors when they were their age (I teach high school). "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school English teacher (and my job is fun if admin stays out of my way fwiw). 

I taught Kindergarten overseas at an IB PYP program / International School and it was pretty fun. I would hate Elementary in the US because of the testing focus, scripted programs, and culture. 

I didn't mind the emotional neediness of the kids (they were super needy) and taught my kiddos a lot of independence BUT my model had a coteacher (not in the room the whole time together - we taught different subjects but she did lunch and recess which were the hardest non field trip parts IMO), only 14 students max, and was focused on whole child learning through the PYP stuff so it wasn't as exhausting as it probably is for you. My kids all had rich and relatively involved parents too -- though a few were sort of emotionally neglected. But parental attention helps curb the neediness to some degree. You still have to teach them literally EVERYTHING. 

I think teaching Kinder CAN be really fun. Singing. Games. Art projects. Reading storybooks. Creative writing. My kiddos were doing very rigorous work (to be fair, they usually came to me from preschools reading at a 1st-2nd grade level but most were reading at a 4th level when we finished the year). We wrote, read, they did math up to multiplication with my coteacher, we did science experiments. But it was almost all super fun and about being a community because that's how you create lifelong learners. I can't imagine an American Kinder being like that today. 

American Elementary Schools seem like hell for students and teachers. "
highschoolteachers,"I would pretty rarely assign a 5 page paper (though I don't assign by pages but by word count when there are length requirements, and depending on your font and spacing rules, that could be pretty close to my research paper length) because I'm honestly going to struggle to find time to carefully read and mark them. So, it's partially just because what you're asking is rare. I teach top students and prepare them for AP/IB so we write a lot but usually shorter essays. 

Honestly, in the 90s, I wrote a lot of short papers but rarely one that long. AP writing is fairly short so most of my AP classes required tons of shorter writing frequently. My senior year, after I'd taken all APs, I took dual enrollment at the Community College and I don't think I wrote anything that long. In regular college, I did for sure, but I was literally a Writing major (English but specialization in Writing, not Lit). While I wrote papers of that length for my specialty college classes and even my Minor of Marketing, I think it was pretty rare I wrote anything that long -- but again depends on spacing rules etc -- for a Gen Ed. Though to be fair I'd gotten out of most Gen Eds via AP or CLEP or dual enrollment. But my point is that it's a fairly decent length we're talking most likely. 

And in high school when I did write something that long, teachers often didn't read it. I know my 10th English Honors teacher who was the basketball coach assigned long papers but never really read them. We'd embed, ""Are you reading this?"" In the paper with no response / noticing. I always got 100s. One time I wrote pages 2- end on an episode of Buffy because I already had so much extra credit I didn't have to do the paper, and nothing. My AP Psych teacher assigned long essays but he never made comments or knew who'd written which topics. Also everyone with the pages got 100. (He graded short writings harshly to his credit.) The only other teacher I remember assigning anything lengthy was my drama teacher to his highest level class and we were only 20 and he only had one period. He did read and comment. But I think it was usually 3-4 pages, not quite 5. I often wrote over minimum because I had a lot to say in my reviews/analysis and he read stuff. I loved writing papers but always tried to figure out who actually read them because I craved feedback and to be heard. 

But I do think testing and low expectations are making lazier kids. I just don't think I would've seen that assignment much even as a top student in the 90s. Now the reading...I for sure had TONS more reading than kids today in comparable classes. There are kids complaining about reading in AP classes. But I think it's worst at the Regular / lowest level where we push everyone to graduation. The expectations there are super low. "
highschoolteachers,"Very interesting, I'm in finishing high school this year and am seriously looking into linguistic education. I've taken the three languages my school offers two to the second level and one to the first level, so I'm pretty sure linguistics is what I want to do. However, I'm not sure if i want to go into education. I think it'd be the safest route, however I'm not sure it is right for me. What would a job look like with having a literacy specialist doctorate? 

Edit: What I mean is what kind of teacher/administrator positions are available to you after you get your doctorate? "
highschoolteachers,"Responding to your comment of academic journals and paywalls, I wholeheartedly agree with you.  As someone who is going through grad school, I have to use a VPN connection to remotely access my university's library website so I can use Google Scholar unhindered in my quest for sources and research.

I will always appreciate one of my high school English teachers for this though, as he knew the local loophole.  He had us all go to San Francisco as homework (we lived in Oakland, so this was not a hard sell) to get a public library card from there.  It gave us free access to JSTOR and a bunch of other databases so that we could have access to those websites.

I would agree with your position about the fact that many other websites lack the transparency that Wikipedia does.  I just assigned a research project to some upperclassmen and watch them grow woefully lost pulling notes and information from wikipedia, prezi, and other work-sharing/copying sites instead of actually going to reputable locations for information.  I'm going to be readdressing that tomorrow in class."
highschoolteachers,"Shit if I knew I would tell you.  I played competitively in high school so I get to be a bit of an authority figure with regard to that as well.  Rolemodel gamer maybe?  I dunno, I was really surprised by the positivity in their responses to the reflection questions."
highschoolteachers,"I'm going to assume that you're asking about grade inflation, because I want to ask if it exists. I remember my high school teachers laying out their grading systems would often talk about other systems they had dealt with. One system I often heard was the bell curve, statistically forcing the grades onto a symmetrical curve which groups the majority of the grades into the C range and for every A guarantees an F. With the bell curve, probably, less common today than in the past, how can you quantify grade inflation? Most teachers use assessment systems that quantifies the correlation between material presented with material mastery. The bell curve method quantifies mastery assuming that the top scores (however high) demonstrate complete mastery and low scores (regardless of the size in the gap between top and bottom) demonstrate total failure. If you had a data set where one teacher used a bell curve then, statistically, you can't measure grade inflation. If you can't measure it does it exist?"
highschoolteachers,"I’m a second year high school art teacher and it can be really tough! It’s ok to feel that way. You’re adjusting to a really big role and a lot of responsibility. Try to push through, you’ll be amazed at how much you learn during your first year that makes your second year so much less overwhelming! You can do it. Let me know if I can help you process through anything. "
highschoolteachers,New teacher here and I feel ya. I’ve cried almost everyday this week. I teach high school art. 
highschoolteachers,"They’re seniors in high school. I can not sit down and have a rationale discussion about how to do something they should have learned 5-6 years ago. It’s not about the how to do it anyway, it’s just 100% laziness. They see 5 pages and think this should take weeks. 

I’m just bitter because it seems like every passing year the kids get worse. I’m not a jaded teacher. But stuff like this makes me inch towards it. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and do it. "
highschoolteachers,"5 pages? I had kids decide not to do an extra credit assignment today because writing 3 PARAGRAPHS of opinion/analysis of an image was too much! High school kids complaining about writing a few paragraphs of their thoughts down for an easy grade! See if I offer it again, kiddos...

&amp;#x200B;

It was a big shock, the difference between expectations in high school when I was a teen versus now... and I'm not that old. I just hit 30.  I honestly think it is cell phones making them have the attention span of a goldfish that any sustained effort is akin to torture/""impossible"", and having parents who are my age who have zero expectations of hard work from their kids. I've met MANY teens in the past 5 years who have never been required to do chores at home. Literally, they don't have any responsibilities at home. It boggles the mind. "
highschoolteachers,"Hi everyone! 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently switched career tracks from scientific research to informal science education through a science museum. I'm a part of a team that teaches hands-on science lessons to students from pre-K to high school. I absolutely love my job and would like to get better at facilitation, teaching, and classroom control, but I don't have an education background. Are there any books, podcasts, youtube videos, anything that you would recommend to start building a teaching skill set?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your help!!"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Testing has slowly been eroding everything about school for years and perhaps this is the year it hits home?

No child left behind was enacted in 2001 and expanded testing greatly, the generation who started school under it are now well into high school. It correlates with complaints by high school teachers about the quality of students  they have been receiving. "
highschoolteachers,"Here's a rant about our districts central office. I'll apologize in advance for the length. 

I teach in a state where accountability for high school has been boiled down to Junior ACT scores.

I realize the necessary evil of the ACT and other standardized tests. I get that they help hold teachers accountable and are one of the only ways for colleges to assess if kids are ready to take on college material. I don't agree with it, but I get it.

Within the past month our English department was told we were going to switch around every students schedule in order to group kids based off ACT scores. In October. One quarter in. Our department decides to take Wednesdays and group everyone in different classes on that day, that way students (even seniors) get ACT RTI. Fine, I understand. I'm not happy that my seniors have to do it because I teach in a rural county and I might have 10 total kids in my English IV classes that plan on ever looking at another ACT. I gripe, but I do my job and teach the groups I'm given on Wednesday (yesterday).

I was expecting a cluster...well, you know. But things actually went over pretty well and even my seniors didn't really complain. Well, today our department was in meetings all day with our Curriculum Coordinator and our Director of Pupil personnel and they bring up adding another day for reading. We agreed that we'd do a Reading ACT day in our own classes (once again, I have seniors and the overwhelming majority will not ever see another ACT) in the morning meeting. I go along with it, whatever. I still get 3 days to actually teach things that might interest my kids.

The English teachers who have juniors then go into the meetings for the second half of the day (we only had enough subs for half the department to go at a time). They come back with the news that they have to spend 1 day on English ACT stuff given to us by a consultant our school has hired, and then 2 more days a week teaching out of this Mastery ACT book our district just bought. They're down to 2 actual instructional days a week. 2 days where they actually get to put their degree to use instead of read from a script. And I'm told I might have to as well because I have 4 juniors total spread across 5 English IV classes.

I've decided I'm done with teaching after this year. There was a chance I was going to stick with it before all this happened, but these past few weeks have been the final nails in the coffin. 

Why am I so far in student debt if they can hand us scripts to read from and expect us to teach that. Why have I spent all this money on a masters degree when they could bring in someone from the street to essentially do the same thing I'll be doing? Why do my seniors not get the chance to learn to like reading and writing by doing stuff that interests them in English, rather than going over the same grammar rules and reading bull shit ACT reading passages every single day? Why can't I teach them the critical thinking skills they need when they leave my school? It's infuriating. "
highschoolteachers,"Not crazy! I would go down the wikipedia rabbithole many a night myself back in middle/high school (still do once and a while), and I'd love to be able to instill that same curiosity in kids! "
highschoolteachers,"Lowering the standard to whining/ill prepared kids is part of why we have this problem. 

They’re getting worse. They’re less motivated, less prepared, and more entitled. For the most part, at least where I am, they know that there is a very, very slim chance that they’ll actually fail to the point that they won’t graduate on time. They don’t care if they have to give up an elective next semester to take an easy, remedial, online English class in the spring. They’ve been failing grades/finals for years with no real consequences. Why would they believe there will be a consequence in high school?"
highschoolteachers,"I think expectations have been consistently getting lowered over the years. I wasn’t an honors student in high school, and I had homework on a regular basis. Now, it’s considered a ridiculous idea to give homework in non honors classes because the students won’t do it. Work ethic seems to have dropped off because expectation of work ethic has dropped. That’s my view at least. 

For what it’s worth, I give homework occasionally in my non honors classes, and most of the kids actually do it! It’s not much, and it’s only once a week or so, but about 75% of them do it consistently, which isn’t much worse than the percentage of my honors kids who consistently do their assigned reading. "
highschoolteachers,"This reminds me of the brief but intense FormSpring era in my senior year of high school...soooo much anonymous cyberbullying...

Echoing the previous commenter, this definitely has ""Myspace Top 8"" vibes to it haha. I had a friend who basically threatened to never speak to me again if she wasn't in my top 8 haha. But to answer your question, teenagers will find a forum for drama whether it's a physically written ""burn book"" circa 1997 or an app. I wouldn't say it's a technology/social media issue, it's just the normal skewed proirities of teenagers (popularity, crushes etc) in a different media. "
highschoolteachers,"Between when I was a student vs now that I'm a teacher? Nah. I never studied or did my homework once during high school and got straight As.

I have no doubt that it *happened* in the past, though."
highschoolteachers,"My last day of student teaching (high school theatre) one of the kids, a senior who was much taller and broader than me, gave me a card. That wasn't weird in and of itself. Several students gave me cards that day. But when I went to take it from him, he held onto it, stepped forward into my personal space, and said ""I'll really miss you, \[first name\]."" in this really low, voice that I think was trying to be seductive. My response was to back up and say, ""I'm still your teacher and you must still call me Ms. Calltimeisfive."" I was very uncomfortable. "
highschoolteachers,"I feel overwhelmed every year. I'm in my 12th year teaching high school chemistry. I teach honors and IB levels - so I have the best kids. I LOVE working with them. However, I am constantly overwhelmed with the amount of work I need to and zero time to do it. 

I have a few rules for myself:
-No working on the weekend
-If I work on school days outside of contract time, I only work on things that directly impact student learning (no working on work handed down by admin). I generally arrive 45 min before and stay 45 min after. 
-I keep a running list of things I am not going to do. These are ""expectations"". It just ain't gonna happen. I don't have time/there is no evidence it increases student learning.
-No emails outside of contract time
These rules help me manage my time and feel productive. "
highschoolteachers,I was supervising at recess and a kindergarten student asks me why I’m here today. I sure it was more of a “why are you here today but not other days” question but I jokeingly reply “because they pay me a salary”. He looks at me and his face gets all crinkly and says “I don’t even like celery” and walks away. Made me laugh so hard I cried. I teach high school at a k-12 so these little moments are rare but wonderful. 
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for all you do! My son has high functioning autism and I know he's been 'that kid' for just about every teacher he's had. I know that my kid knows he's 'that kid.'


He has an IEP and gets some supports throughout the day. He's calmed down some now that he's in high school and can logicly make his way to understanding social interaction and he manages his behavior better now.


So as the parent of 'that kid' I totally get your frustration and I'm sorry my kid is such a pain in the ass sometimes!"
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I can definitely see that. I’m actually at a trade high school now and all the career options are awesome pay wise and really set you up nice, but I’m just not set on what I want to do yet. Thanks for the info"
highschoolteachers,"I just left an IB MYP program after seven years. Our school was designated to be a feeder school for the DP at the high school level.  From my understanding, you can apply for the job, then they will either send you to multiple trainings or you will be trained on site. You also need to have your teaching credentials, so if you're not certified you might need to go back to school for a bit to obtain your teacher license. "
highschoolteachers,"We don't.

Generally speaking as a teacher: we don't give up on the kid. Especially in high school when things change so quickly for young adults from one day to the next.

OP is just mentioning how, sometimes, one kid in the class can make our jobs harder. It's not a reflection of our potential for the person."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah...I'm not sure what you want here. Validation? Absolution? You were a shitty student, and now you're...not? Still an apathetic adult? Looking for some kind of proof that you, an admittedly terrible student, were somehow wronged by all the teachers who ""gave up""on you?  I don't know what you're after, but I will tell you that honestly, your kind is a dime a dozen. By the time you get to high school, it's time to learn to self-motivate, self-redirect, and get shit done. I have compassion to a point. I don't give up on students, but there's some kids every year who are just plain unteachable, and at some point I choose to focus the bulk of my energy on the kids who actually demonstrate that they care. I'm sure there's a superstar teacher out there who makes kids like you their personal project, and I'm glad that someone found your magic bullet. Great. I've probably done that for my students in the past, too, without knowing. But my course are overloaded, I'm already unable to do the best I could do at teaching what I've already got because of multiple factors, and I've got my own needs and hobbies and problems to deal with outside of school. I do what I can for the students while they're in my room and in my school, but at the end of the day, at the end of the year, I walk away. 

You know what I find more obnoxious about being a teacher than anything else? The whole mentality that kids get to take credit for their success but I'm supposed to take all the blame for their failures.  In reality? I'm thrilled when my students are successful, however that is defined. I love hearing about kids who were shitty human beings while they were in school but have pulled their act together and made something good of their lives. I'm sure I played a small part in that, so yay. But I'm not a social worker, I'm not a mind reader, and I'm not omniscient. I can't magically figure out every student who sits in my room and makes little or no effort to be known.  You go get to know every aspect of the lives of 140 strangers real quick and get back to me on how much you really know about them after a few weeks. And I rarely (not never, just rarely) obsess years later about what I could have should have might have done differently to deal with a kid I barely knew who made no effort. It's not that teachers don't care, it's just that the way you expect them to demonstrate caring and the reality of who they are and what they can do don't usually match up with your expectations, and teenagers are generally too immature and inwardly-focused to recognize the difference.
"
highschoolteachers,"Ah the self-righteous among us...my favorite.

&gt;Sit ""that kid"" next to one of your best students, tell them you expect more than any of their other teachers, and fucking be the difference.

If you think sitting ""that kid"" next to a smart kid and giving them an ""aw geez little fella, I expect more from you,"" is going to be effective classroom management, then you have never had ""that kid.""

Also why does one of your high achieving student's education have to suffer? You sound like a self-righteous prick who's not being empathetic to a teacher that is venting. 

Edit: You're a goddamn high school tutor, not even a teacher."
highschoolteachers,"lol, that's what i thought. but i'm not a teacher and i've been out of high school a while, i can't keep up."
highschoolteachers,"Hoooo boy do I feel you. Actually, here in California there was recently a bill to delay high school start times for the benefit of adolescents whose sleep schedules are naturally off... and every time I was reading the articles about it I was just thinking that I never really grew out of those teen circadian rhythms. Like, are there actually human beings who wake up naturally at 6am??? Who are these bizarre creatures and why was their schedule preference chosen above ours?

I live 15 minutes from school and can get away with getting up at 7:15 if I shower at night instead of in the morning. I did this intentionally for my mental health. A therapist once straight-out told me I might not be able to take certain jobs that require certain schedules. It's just something I've had to accept about myself. I usually aim for 6:45 wake-up. I am absolutely not at my most productive hour in the early morning and I despise people who are all ""go get 'em!"" If it were pushed just one hour back, it would make such a huge difference. And I know I'm lucky!!! Honestly, if I had to get up at 5:15 I just... wouldn't. I would become a ball of nerves and then would disintegrate after a month. I don't know how you do it."
highschoolteachers,"I'm student teaching this year, and before I started, I got that kind of comment from some of my parents' friends. One even implied that I shouldn't teach high school because it would be too distracting for the boys.

I have no idea how we're supposed to respond to comments like that, but you're not alone and I don't think you're being too sensitive."
highschoolteachers,"r/unpopularopinion

But seriously, this is an important question our society has been ignoring. Yes, we do need everyone to be basically literate and numerate - people who can't read will be a menace on the highway, at the very least. But beyond a certain point (maybe, 8th-10th grade?), shouldn't we allow kids to opt out of school? A few generations of that and kids would take their education more seriously.

Another strategy the US needs to seriously consider is adopting a European-style model of tiered schooling, where kids are stratified into different types of schools depending on ability/effort. Some kids will target trade schools and graduate with a marketable skill, others can take all the pre-collegiate courses they want.

The districts where I grew up had 'magnet' high schools, which specialized in certain disciplines (e.g., fine arts, STEM) and accepted applications from rising high schoolers. If you weren't interested, you just went to your local high school. The fine arts school had an advanced computer lab for graphics and web design, and the STEM school had a nifty robotics lab. No high school could afford that shit on its own.

It's nice to bloviate on the couch with Reddit and a glass of wine at the end of block day."
highschoolteachers,"I think just knowing a teacher’s political views is ‘pushing’ them - as in, it will influence what the students think. I had an absolutely brilliant government teacher in high school who was always obscure in what he believed - and if he had been open, I would have blindly followed whatever he believed because I trusted him. 

So no, I don’t share political beliefs. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree. The jocks are still jocks, nerds etc. 

Think of it this way...a lot of teachers went to high school, then college, then back to working in a school. I see a huge difference between the teachers that held jobs before being teachers. 

"
highschoolteachers,"I usually tell people that if they think I’m hot, they need glasses. 

Trust me after all the porn that high school aged male students watch, they definitely don’t find me attractive and I think they all smell like BO."
highschoolteachers,"It’s gross.  I have had high school boys have crushes on me, and some of them are actually quite creepy about it.  One would constantly stand super close to me and try to come to my room when no one else was there, another would try to hug me without warning and made weird comments.  It’s terrifying as a teacher because if I address it, they could easily deny it and make it sound like I’m the one with “ideas.”  

People laugh it off, but maintaining professional distance is incredibly important with HS students who are more keenly aware of their relationships with others. "
highschoolteachers,"With that age group, I think I would have made that a whole-group teaching moment. I can assure you, that kid will still be sprinkling his staph all over his high school as well. I see it daily and some years just one kid like that is a direct correlation to me and my students being out sick more often. 

Ugh, humans are gross. :)"
highschoolteachers,"I want to be clear.  Dumping water on a computer is not my typical student.  There is no ""kind"".  Most of my students are there for a semester or two.  I am talking about one of the worst kids there.  I think most teachers have a few.   However, yeah my parents would not have put up with failing high school, causing chaos etc.  Same student had to be escorted off campus to prevent a fight today. "
highschoolteachers,"Not the person your asking, but I would imagine it grossly varies. 

I’m in NC (terrible state for teachers). Aides do not make a livable wage at all. They could literally make more working at McDonalds. The only requirement they have is to take a 1 hour online course called “Effective Teacher Training” or have an associates degree and have a high school diploma.  This means aides are usually people who aren’t super ambitious. They don’t want the fast pace of fast food, or retail hours, but don’t have the ambition to get a certificate/diploma or train for a trade. Occasionally you hit the air lottery. Meaning you get an aide like mine, a retired teacher who was bored at home. She is wonderful and loves children. She especially loves that she now gets to do her favorite part about teaching - teach without making lesson plans, going to meetings, etc.  I have also had okish aides that were formerly stay at home moms. These ladies were always sweet, caring, involved, good workers, etc. but they don’t have an educational background. So I find I spend hours writing up step by step directions for things or having to deal with them thinking some decisions are “stupid”. "
highschoolteachers,"Most of what you posted about elementary would pertain to someone who is highly ineffective in doing their job. Like someone else said, sub and get real experience before watching YouTube videos to get your information. Also, for high school, you need a degree in the content area you teach in and then do the teaching as a minor."
highschoolteachers,I teach electives in an alternative high school. I love every day of my job. At risk education is where I belong and as such couldn't be happier....
highschoolteachers,"I got it on Thursday so my vacation gettin extended 😎 . But considering how non-chalant my shit hole high school is about mask mandates and testing , best believe, a few classes will be emptied out by the end of the week. My district supposedly has one of the highest rate of unvaccinated in the city and a lot of students think the vaccine’s gonna alter their DNA while some still don’t even believe the virus is real so yeah- glad I’m not walkin in on Monday."
highschoolteachers,"My high school had students always doing dip, so I could see it with high schoolers."
highschoolteachers,"My son isn’t required to wear one at his high school, but he chooses to.  He still came home with the virus in September. I’m also masked up at my school and taking precautions.  I was his caretaker while he had the virus, and by the grace of God’s didn’t get it.  All I can do is just remind him to be as careful as possible."
highschoolteachers,"In my third full year as a high school sped teacher, and I love it. I enjoy being able to push into a variety of different classes and work with different teachers."
highschoolteachers,I teach high school art at an international school in china.  Love my job and living here.  Hopefully I’ll be able to travel when covid gets under control.
highschoolteachers,"my high school does not even have a library of its own, it got removed and renovated into a larger office lol. the closest public library is about a 10 minute walk from the school and obviously practically zero kids save for a couple motivated ones who read for fun ever go there. really make you think about how the funding is allocated… 😕"
highschoolteachers,I started in 7th grade and I hated it. Switching to high school was a game changer. I don't think I'd still teaching if I was in middle school.
highschoolteachers,"There aren't many schools that offer philosophy as a class for high school at all, let alone a full-time position.

I think you're searching for something that exists only very rarely. And if it does, your chances of getting it instead of someone with experience, connections, etc are very slim.

If this is the only thing you would want to teach, you need to reconsider teaching. If you could think of something else, then do that. Math is logic (philosophy), for example."
highschoolteachers,"As long as it’s high school, classroom management isn’t too bad and I like being able to teach higher level content. You couldn’t pay me enough to teach middle school again; classroom management was like 90 percent of the job and I felt like all I did was break up fights and double as a school counselor. Also, forget about ever being able to sit at your desk to grade, plan, or answer emails while teaching middle school."
highschoolteachers,"I am certified k-12: k-6 elementary and 6-12 math and cs. I switched to teaching CS around 5 years ago, and teaching an elective compared to math with standardized testing is what kept me in teaching. It mattered more than the age of my students. I will admit the freshmen are hard to deal with, but seniors give up in 3rd quarter, so there are pros and cons to every grade. I also like that I get to teach both freshmen and seniors with a large range in content (the freshmen content is obviously a much lower level than the senior content). Overall, I would recommend seeing if you can teach a high school elective that would provide you with these opportunities. Let me know if you have questions."
highschoolteachers,"Currently 8th grade science and high school Earth and Space Science. I've also done 7th grade science.

I'm not a fan of my middle school admin at all, but I like my content."
highschoolteachers,"I really like it there. I only have six students and teach all high school subjects. (Plus one of those six kids is actually an 8th grader.) I have absolute full autonomy. There is no curriculum. We don't follow state standards and they are exempt from state exams. Many of them are super behind, so we do things like practice multiplication and basic essay mechanics. We teach to the individual. I differentiate for each individual kid. It's fabulous.

That said, their behavior often sucks and we have bullshit to put up with, but not educational bullshit."
highschoolteachers,"Gotta find what you love. 

I teach 7&amp;8th grade science. Wouldn’t teach anything else. 6th grade are a bunch of whiners, still too elementary for me. Major growth between 6th and 7th. 

If I could teach just one grade it would be 8th. Wouldn’t go to freshmen and deal with them as first year of high school but that’s maybe based on my high school situations where they would force me to teach all grades at high school where I would really only be interested in juniors and teaching them physics."
highschoolteachers,"I teach English as a New Language (ESL/ENL/TESOL) to K/1 and 5. When my kids were little, there wasn't enough money in the world to get me to work with K. I just felt that I had enough ""little needy kid"" stuff going on at home to have it all day at school too. My admin decided to move me from 5/8 to K in what appeared to be a punitive measure. The joke was on them, though, I LOVED Kindergarten. I've done that for 10 years and have really fallen out of love with the littles. They are coming in with bigger and bigger academic, social defecits along with less and less school readiness skills. and I just find myself exhausted at the end of the day.

I have been looking to transition to high school because I can't stand the hormonal insanity of middle schoolers but in my district, there are only a couple of ""good"" buildings and I'm not going to make the choice lightly.

This is my first year back with 5th grade and I actually like it pretty well so if I can't get into another school, I will try to angle to work with just 4th/5th."
highschoolteachers,I teach high school and have worked my way up to having some classes that are upperclassmen and/or advanced students. I love teaching those classes.
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English. I couldn't imagine working with any other age group.

I like to joke that middle school is a pointless time and they should just lock students up for three years with their hormones to figure shit out, and then come to high school ready to learn."
highschoolteachers,Go see a doctor to go on leave. I was a NYC public high school teacher and leaving has been the best thing I ever did.
highschoolteachers,"My program was under the impression that it would be solved by every teacher working reading into their lesson. “We are all reading teachers,” even to the art, math, and physical education teachers. We, at the high school level, can’t solve the reading crisis by putting some word problems into math lessons."
highschoolteachers,"Having to constantly confiscate and hide objects that could be used as weapons... exacto knives, hammers, wire cutting tools, ect...

I'm a high school art teacher.

These things are littered around the room and now I have a desk full of hammers."
highschoolteachers,Bless both of you. Teaching 9th graders this year who are on the emotional and educational maturity level of middle schoolers has really reinforced my love for high school
highschoolteachers,"Ancient Greek - 11th and 12th 
Latin - 9th and 10th 

I teach exactly what I studied in college and it’s dope. Kids have to choose their language in high school and so my kids are in the classes by choice. Love that shit."
highschoolteachers,"I take anxiety medication and didn’t start until I was teaching for several years.  However, my anxiety was something that was growing since high school - I just didn’t realize it.  Therefore, I don’t take it “because” of teaching.  Honestly, working is good for me, otherwise I overthink everything too much - work keeps my brain busy.  I just do what I can and work minimal hours outside of school (Im also childfree so that probably helps with the anxiety, blood pressure and overall stressed feeling others might have)."
highschoolteachers,"Oh no! Part of the reason I’m choosing to teach high school students. Although, I hope this story is from an elementary student 😅"
highschoolteachers,Juniors in high school. They realize college applications are just a year away and the senioritis hasn’t taken them.
highschoolteachers,"I’ve taught 6-12. 9-12 for 7 years and 6-8 for 4. I would take 6-8 over high school all day! I really didn’t enjoy high school the way I thought I would. 

I think it’s different for everyone based on what makes you click. I also think you need some time in one age range before you really get a feel for it to decide if it does or doesn’t work. I struggled with my middle schoolers at first but once I figure them out I realized my teaching style and personality is a much better natural fit for them than high school"
highschoolteachers,"LOL! Oh, yeah!! I was a secondary high school ELA teacher for years and had to repeat every my performance five times a day with as little as five minutes in between."
highschoolteachers,"2 weeks break, I spent about 2-3 hours lesson planning one prep to make it to midterms (we're on a messed up schedule that ends the semester three weeks after we get back.)

Planning on spending more hours today and tomorrow just to get ahead of things. I have two more preps I want to have finished up until midterms  and a massive chunk of online training to spend some mindless time on. I have a workday tomorrow, which is fortunate.

I'm in my third year teaching high school math, three preps and one is AP Calc, which I'm teaching for the first time this year. It is what it is. I'm hoping to get to a point where I can spend all my planning blocks between now and midterms on Q3."
highschoolteachers,"I student taught in K-2, and 9-12. I’m now in 5th and much happier. I knew high school wasn’t going to be for me. I enjoyed working with the little kids, but 5th graders are a happy medium between kid energy and teen resourcefulness. It’s nice being able to be hands off more. With K-2 I was exhausted. I enjoyed it for the most part, but I was so tired everyday."
highschoolteachers,"Definitely agree, critical thinking skills are absolutely needed in today’s society. Not too familiar with high school courses (I teach elementary) but debate or public speaking classes have some similarities with philosophy courses. May try that route until you can create your own niche?"
highschoolteachers,That’s actually some really good advice. I’ll make sure to do my research. During my high school days I was moved around from school to school to school. I found smaller towns to be friendlier. Except for one. Huge drug problems amount the students. Police always patrolling. The graduating rates were really low and they hardly had any long term teachers. I’ll definitely think about this and not just jump at the first opportunity I get after university without doing my research first
highschoolteachers,"Well financially it is tricky.  But there is also retooling.  If I leave education I want to leave it completely.  I don’t want to go onto the parasitic side and work for EdTech or Curricular shit.  I want to do Data Science, but that is going to require a good amount of retooling.  I can code in a couple of languages but it’s probably not enough. 

Kids make it tricky as well.  Teaching was a second career for me.  So I know the type of time investment I will have to give starting out in a new field- the same was true for teaching.  My kids are school aged and I know that I can not rely on the school system to give them the skills and knowledge they need.  Being on a similar schedule to them assists in this.  

But I am not going to lie, I have been in this for 12 years and it’s the worst it has ever been and I see no light at the end of this tunnel.  What has become apparent is that the consumer model of education has reached a new low, where the lives of staff are expendable for the glory of the high school athletes. That is what we high school teachers are going to work for next week.  Not for learning, not even for daycare, rather just as a locker room prior to the activities that our society values most, sports."
highschoolteachers,Telling high school students to stop saying FUCK in the classroom.
highschoolteachers,"I live in Florida and teach high school, no one in Florida cares about anything, most teachers are out here rawdogging, no mask and no vaccines, I think maybe 30 out of our 3,100 students wear a mask. Our governor hates his people.

I'm probably going to die before the end of the year, if I get sick though, don't be surprised if you hear about a Florida man biting his governor."
highschoolteachers,"I experience a fair number of gifted students who have skated through our school system's elementary and middle schools. Most of our students come from extreme poverty and homes where their parents, when present, have no respect for school. Ultimately, the teachers end up focusing so much on the struggling students who need all the extra help that they often ignore the gifted students, who by comparison, seem super smart although they're really not. When they come to me, many of them openly tell me they've never had to study in their lives because there was no rigor involved, and they never really had to do any homework. They also have realized by high school that most of their teachers never actually read their work or offer feedback so they don't view assignments as anything more than busy work that isn't important. When I get them, they suddenly realize they are not as smart as all their prior teachers told them they were \[a phrase I hear them say often themselves\] - and when they struggle with my subject, many of them just give up early because they've never experienced struggle."
highschoolteachers,"I did elementary and high school student teaching, the high schoolers gave those elementary kids a run for their money in the immaturity department. 🤦‍♀️"
highschoolteachers,I had to lent roll weave off my suit after breaking up a girls fight when I was a high school teacher.
highschoolteachers,"If you're looking to leave eventually, the position you should go for in education is a teacher assistant. 

I do not recommend becoming  time teacher because that requires a degree/finishing a teacher prep program and to pass certification tests within your state. 

Examples:

Coming from a NY perspective - a TA only needs a high school diploma (or higher education), pass a test, and take some workshops. 

To be a full time teacher is getting a BA, fulfilling a teacher prep program (student teaching), and taking however many tests needed to be certified."
highschoolteachers,"If you want to teach as a filler, go get a degree in what you actually want to do with your life. Then teach for a year or two to see if you like it while looking for the job and location you want in your preferred profession. There’s such a teaching shortage that as long as you have a degree you can at least substitute, if not get a full time position.

While you’re working toward your degree, get part time or summer jobs that let you work with children/teens. It will help you understand whether you really want to make that part of your life full time.

It will be hard figuring out the teen piece of the equation because you’re so close in age to them. I student taught in a high school during college and it’s a weird dynamic to be in charge of students who you yourself could have gone to high school with and have the save age differential as your (my) parents.

Finally, make sure you can put your child first while doing whatever job you choose. I find it very hard to put my children first in teaching and make that a big part of my thought process when I’m changing positions. Just because the school day is 8 - 3:30 or whatever does not mean that you can necessarily get everything done in that time at every school."
highschoolteachers,"Wow.  I'm sorry to hear that.  At my high school in San Diego school district we have free tests every Tuesday, shots every Wednesday, and before we left for break the district gave every student 2 free home tests.  I grabbed a few for myself, too.  Please be careful and stay well."
highschoolteachers,"From my personal experience-

I was that student. I was a “troubled youth” who was fortunate enough to be accepted into and environmental charter school. It changed my life for the better, but my grades and work ethic did not reflect that. 

The senior project was worth a large percentage of our final grades. We did not do testing other than standardized. I did nothing for my final project. Not a single ounce of work. My teachers collectively decided to pass me anyway. They say me down and told me they were doing this because they didn’t want me jeopardizing my own future. 

Because of their actions against my inability to perform academically, 12 years later, I am now a teacher myself. I was able to be accepted into multiple private universities (with the help of my SAT score). I am now an advocate for environmental education and strong supporter of charter schools. Without that decision, my life would have undoubtably been more difficult and less fulfilling. 

A friend of mine during high school was in the exact same position as me. He did not complete his final project, and wailed miserably when they announced he had failed. I kept my mouth shut about what they had done for me and felt awful. He has since been subjected to alcoholism, depression, drug use, hospitalization and to this day suffers from his actions senior year. 

I will never forget the blatant favoritism I was a part of. I have wrestled with gratitude and shame over their decision for years. I have built a beautiful life for myself, and I see my friend suffering constantly. 

You have the power to make or break a persons life. But ultimately, what they do with your decision is up to them. We are bound by decisions made by others, and the consequences of our own actions. The lines are blurred when it comes to the moral obligations of teaching. You are empowered to do everything you can to change students lives for the better, but the choice is a tough one. 

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,Your kindergarten program sucks. I would Hate to be that 5 year old and you.  I’m sure you didn’t go to college to be an online teacher like this. I thought this was a story about a high school kid…sorry for your struggles
highschoolteachers,"If I can be honest: yes, so many of that kind of student!

Some it's clearly because other stuff is going on in their lives so school is not their priority. I get it, but it does suck. They won't get a do-over of high school, so I just hope that their life improves and they make it out with enough skills to make progress. Sometimes these issues are honestly really big and really suck and I just hope I contribute to them making it through, even if they fail my class. Sometimes these issues aren't that big but I know they feel big to the teenager, and I wish I could help them put it all in perspective, but sometimes you just gotta grow and learn on your own.

Sometimes it's because they haven't figured out their why/motivation yet. That sucks for me, because I can try giving them a bunch of reasons I think they should care, but some are just determined not to care. I struggle with this one the most, I think, because I'm a person who cares about everything (hi, anxiety/ADHD), so I don't fully understand the mindset here.

Sometimes they decide to prioritize their other classes instead of my class, proving that they are a capable student.. but just not for my class. On the one hand, I get it, you gotta do what you gotta do to make it through. On the other hand, sometimes it can feel personal, like I'm the teacher they care least about or something, and that can suck.

I have many friends who would probably claim to be that student. They talk about how it's partly about protesting the system, boycotting busy work and being so smart they were so bored so they failed etc. I admit I don't fully understand this one, though I try and I know I also see it. It's easy to claim that you obviously would have aced it if you'd done any of the work but you were too smart to bother doing any of the work, but, frankly, we as teachers need evidence, so, sorry if the fact that we give you work to grade offends you. Some of them state their failing grades proudly as though it helps change the system. But honestly, the only person it affects is you.

I guess at this point I'm a little bit rambly-ranting, and also forgetting many of the subsets of ""that student,"" but yes, it is common. I'm sure your teacher would appreciate an email or something saying, ""Hey, sorry I didn't put in the effort then, but I realize now that you put the effort in on me and I appreciate it."""
highschoolteachers,"Would agree here. This subreddit is basically everyone complaining and quitting their jobs. You won't know if you truly enjoy teaching until you do it though. Elementary sounds terrible to me (high school science teacher here)...and it depends on the state you get a job in. Do your research and decide. I've worked office jobs before and they're so f'ing boring, how could you ever feel fulfilled? Teaching is what you make of it. It's very fun and rewarding. Fuck spreadsheets and whatever else you do in the cubical."
highschoolteachers,"I’m a high school teacher now, but I was this student too. I was overwhelmed and afraid of failure, so I just didn’t try. Looking back, I know that was terrible justification on my part because I was definitely capable, and I wish an adult (teacher, counselor, someone) would have reached out to me and helped me figure that out then. But all we can do is learn from our past mistakes and do better. Don’t be too hard on yourself"
highschoolteachers,"I'm still a student teacher, but my partner was this student in high school. He's smart as hell and has so much potential but when he was in high school he just didn't care to show it. He says that the few teachers that did push him just that little bit more made all the difference for him. When someone showed even the slightest bit of pride in his accomplishments, thats what really got him to work. He never got much support at home, other than sarcastic replies of ""oh you got an A? Well when are we going to see this in your other classes?"" Which didn't exactly inspire work ethic. So be kind. Be supportive. Maybe it'll work maybe it won't, but at least you showed them that their work matters."
highschoolteachers,"I follow some of the high school girls I worked with at a summer camp in 2018. They're all in college now. That's the only reason I decided to keep following them. This is like 8-9 19 year old girls.

That said, I don't use my instagram much.

I might be unfollowing them all because a part of my insta doesn't seem like mine. I never post btw."
highschoolteachers,"Nah, it's about accountability. Education should be an institution that sets the standards and expectations for society. But we don't. Administrations perceive us as a customer service industry and the parents are customers. Mmmm, then we give in to them? They're always right? Screw that. They're not, but we give in, fail to hold people accountable and everything slides just a little downhill.  Not a lot, just a little. Then a little more, then a little more. Soon enough a high school diploma doesn't mean anything and it's a rubber stamp and you need a college degree to be competitive in the job market and voila, here we are."
highschoolteachers,"I say ease back into school with reminders of expectations, how to care for materials, class rules, etc. maybe review the syllabus and remind students of upcoming final projects. Maybe group think some ideas if your school were to go virtual. Or fuck that and tour the different art on campus. Sorry if the only art on campus is on the bathroom stalls. My students read “Niko Draws a Feeling” and then created art to share their feelings. Maybe this could be a way to help your anxiety, too? It is a children’s book, but in my experience high schoolers still like to be read to. [Niko Draws a Feeling](https://youtu.be/DfMHQ9LkqEs)"
highschoolteachers,"Students follow me on social media, and if they reply to something I put up, I might reply to them. However, I have never and will never follow a student that. After they graduate is whatever, but my experience with that is that they often leave behind the social media handles they had during high school to make new ones for college and don't even use the old ones that much.

What really sucks is when I follow them back after they graduate and learn that they're turning into terrible young adults. That has only happened a couple of times, but I felt extraordinary sadness each time.

I know teachers who follow current students on social media, and I think they are nuts for that. Nope."
highschoolteachers,"I totally understand what you are going through. I have been teaching for 14 years now and I still get anxious before my classes. It is mostly performance anxiety. And a worry that my lessons would fall flat. Once I see my students I feel relaxed again.

In my first year of teaching (high school science), I taught 2 APs in my first year as well as 4 other preps. Almost gave up on teaching then and there. I thought I had made a mistake going into teaching because I had a good job as a researcher in the food industry. However I can tell you that it gets better. I am now a elementary school STEM specialist and I love what I do. Hope you will feel better about everything."
highschoolteachers,I am a high school student and I am one of the few kids who wears a mask at school. (In class sizes of about 28 usually there’s only 3 kids wearing a mask) It makes me really uncomfortable and also worries me about schools closing again. Going virtual isn’t good for students or teachers mental health and if more people stepped up and wore a mask we wouldn’t have to worry about going virtual. I really wish my school would require masks instead of making them optional since very few students wear masks at my school!
highschoolteachers,"I entered my first classroom 3 weeks after my 21st birthday; it was seniors and two of them were about to age out of high school on their 6th year.

Needless to say it was an awkward first year."
highschoolteachers,"It might make some people laugh Thant I didn’t know the concept of a semester until we moved states in my senior year of high school. Until then, all of my classes were yearly but we had double the classes. She might have had a different school experience."
highschoolteachers,"As a physics teacher for more then 20 years I'd say the biggest pros are the summers off, the relatively high amount of autonomy, and the decent workload after the first year or two building up your classroom management routines and personal curriculum. In particular, physics has the advantage that many students want to take it either to look good for college or because they are interested in a STEM field but it isn't required for high school graduation. Together those mean you often miss most of the weaker students and the biggest troublemakers.

In the US the pay can be a negative although if you are willing to move you can find some parts of the country with decent ratios of pay to cost of living. Teachers overall aren't held in high regard but I have always recurve the feeling that the parents I interact with have respect for me personally so I don't let it bother me."
highschoolteachers,"The problem is that even under harsher grading students still needed remedial math. They still had no idea how DNA is transcribed, what mRNA does, and how base pairs code for proteins. They recited ""the mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell"" to get credit but had no idea what the electron transport chain did.

I went to high school 6 years ago when every teacher gave 0s, when homework was still 1.5 hours/night, when phones weren't allowed, and nobody retained that information for a year, much less long enough to apply it.

I think we can all agree that many students do not deserve to pass. But the issue is that strict grading prioritizes optimizing for points rather than optimizing for content mastery.

Many of the people I went to school with never really developed an appreciation for any of the subjects, and my opinion is that it's because it was presented as a series of tasks needed to get a grade rather than as a quest for scientific understanding."
highschoolteachers,"After I leave a school or after they graduate, I accept some kid friend requests on FB and Insta. I’m really selective about the ones I accept/follow back though. If they didn’t show maturity or respect in my class or I didn’t have a relationship with them, they don’t get accepted. I don’t post anything inappropriate on my SM and honestly don’t post much at all, but I like keeping up with them and seeing where they’ve gone and what they’ve done in life as they’re getting older. I think it’s cool to be able to network with them and be accessible to them post high school should they need me. One of my former students sent me her valedictorian speech on Facebook and thanked me for supporting her. That was really special because I left before she graduated."
highschoolteachers,"My house has managed to avoid it so far! We are two high school teachers in different districts, an 8th grader in a third district, and a preschooler! We know it’s just a matter of time, but we’re all vaccinated (preschooler is 5, just missed the cut off for K the his year)."
highschoolteachers,"My district’s plan has been to open up subbing to anyone with a high school diploma at $9.00 an hour. I’m confident shit show will be an understatement. Active COVID cases in my county have doubled in the last few days, so we’re in for it big time."
highschoolteachers,We have been doing the classes in the auditorium thing since the beginning of the year. There were a few days where the superintendent was actually covering classes! Subs in my district only need high school diploma or GED.
highschoolteachers,"This just flat ignores the mathematical problem here. If I provide my employer $5000 of value this week and $1000 next week they couldn't care less that the output isn't consistent.

In HS if the quota is $3000/week and I get 100% (since grades don't go above 100%) the first week and 20% the next week, I fail with a 60%.

That's why work is infinitely less stressful than high school. I don't worry about dropping some tasks if they are too much.

What actually happens with draconian grading policies is that many of the kids who get high grades fail by every metric - AP test scores, employability, and actual understanding of the material."
highschoolteachers,"It does screw them, though. If you don't let them make it up the math doesn't lie. That kid has to spend 6-7 weeks turning in every single assignment for an 85% to make up for one missing assignment to just get an 80%.

The core problem with grades is that they're so top-heavy. In college, having a 50% average before curve is normal. That means one poor performance can be made up by another excellent performance. Just study harder next time.

But in high school grade inflation is a joke - when the average grade is 80-90% there just isn't room for an exceptional performance to shine. You have to do 4x the effort to get a perfect score for an extra 5% credit. So what's the point other than by doing the bare minimum? And yes, getting good grades mattered for scholarships and college admissions."
highschoolteachers,I think it is weird for any adult who isn't a direct family member to follow any minor on social media. I don't accept any students until after I know they've graduated high school.
highschoolteachers,"I’d be perfectly happy with that as well. I had almost considered choosing to study chemistry instead of physics or even taking a couple chemistry classes as electives. Biology, geology, astronomy or even computer science. I’m a lover of science, my most specific interest may be in physics but I’d be more than happy to educate students on any scientific subject. I’m also open to teaching math at a high school level as I know a job as a physics teacher could be more difficult to find."
highschoolteachers,"So we're in person, but by design, i mostly only grade IXL stuff. It's harder for them to cheat off one another that way, but still most kids i catch cheating use Photomath.I can always reset their score on IXL, but idk how that stops them from using Photomath again.


Im very upfront with my kids. I tell them that they cannot do well if they aren't keeping up with assignments, and a lot of them figured that out when they got a D for quarter 1 so they went and re did a bunch of stuff. I obviously still have a handful of kids who are going to try to re do assignments next week when they find out they failed semester 1, but i tried to mitigate that number myself by doing make up days and the such and giving incentives for being productive during that time (which all in all ended up being helpful I think)


I'm also a first year teacher who did all of her  student teaching during covid so what do I know, ya know? I'm just trying new things every now and then and seeing what sticks. One thing that really works with a lot of my students is when kids want a late assignment graded immediately and I say ""you didn't make doing it a priority so grading it isn't a priority."" I work with high school math at a title 1 school btw."
highschoolteachers,"Yes, that’s why I was choosing high school as well. I want to teach physics and/or math to a higher age group. Students who may be passionate about it. As well, ironically enough for a (hopefully) future teacher, I’ve never been great with younger kids. However, I could certainly teach high school students"
highschoolteachers,"I’ve had a love for physics and specifically astronomy since I was in seventh grade. I had the largest passion for science since then. I’m also a highly creative person. For me, I love the idea of being able to teach students. Be an influence for them, just like how my seventh grade teacher was such a big influence on me. I specifically want to teach high school because I want to share my passion for physics with other potential aspiring physics and scientist. If they don’t choose that path, then I want to educate them as best I can be creative in my lesson plans and try to make education fun.
I like the structure of it too. Sure, I get to be a bit independent in the classroom, but I’ll have a fixed schedule and lesson plan. I would also like to become friendly with the other teachers and staff. Get ideas and advice from them. 
Mainly, I want to share my love of physics with the younger generation. I like the structure and the security of the job. I know the pay is low but, I’ve never been worried about that. Also, you’re guaranteed the major holidays off as well."
highschoolteachers,I am a high school math teacher. I chose high school because I only wanted to teach one subject. I knew in elementary I’d have to teach all subjects and at our middle school we’d have to teach 2 subjects. I just want math all day. I also like the age group vs the younger age groups.
highschoolteachers,"This is what I'm wondering too. I've posted this in another thread on this subreddit before. My dad wasn't educated. He dropped out of high school, later became a nurse when it was still possible to be a nurse with a technical program (now requires a bachelor's in my state, but they grandfathered all existing nurses in.) I don't think my dad even knew what traditional college was. He didn't know about the existence of college dorms. Hadn't the slightest clue what scholarships or college applications even were. He didn't know what a bachelor's vs master's vs PhD was. Didn't know what it meant to ""major"" in something.

He never talked to me about school. Never looked at my grades. I could have had a 4.0 or a 2.0 he wouldn't have known, and wouldn't have cared if he did know. But I will say this, if he saw a video of me disrupting class, disrespecting my teachers, or got a call from the school that I was doing that there would have been hell to pay. I'm glad we have moved past beating children as a form of discipline, and I won't sit here and try to celebrate or encourage it. But if I had flagrantly disrespected my teachers, threatened them, continuously disrupted their class, and my dad got a call from the school I would have been scared to go home. I'd have been terrified if there was a TikTok video of me hitting a teacher or calling a teacher names directly to their face. He absolutely would have fucked me up. He may have not ""highly valued education"" but he would not stand for hooligan behavior. 

So I get how some of these parents also aren't educated and thus don't really care about their kids grades. But how are they ok with their kids just straight up acting criminal? Disrupting class, disrespecting adults, even going as far as to be violent or threaten violence?"
highschoolteachers,"I do a mastery based grading system with a conversion for rubrics.

Everything is rated out of 10 points.

Doing ANY work, even a few sentences, gives you 5 points. 

6-7 is showing understanding, maybe not doing a few questions.

8-9 is answering every question and following instructions.

10 points is above and beyond the basic instructions, and/or all correct answers.

It’s worked well thus far (4 years, both middle and high school) for my English students."
highschoolteachers,"Now.  You should apply for jobs now.  Now I don't know every state or school.  But I know from hiring at my current school and my last you have a few things going against you.  1) You are applying for an English position which usually have a larger number of applicants.  2) While you have teaching experience, it is with a different age group (and it is a completely different experience) so there are likely more experienced applicants than you  3)Your experience is at a charter and not at a public school so it isn't considered to be equal experience.  

You may not get the job you want right away.  You can obviously keep applying to high school positions, but I would consider applying to middle school ones as well because that cancels out point 2 against you. 

Also, if you have an attitude in the interview that middle school is a 'lower standard' than high school, it could be turning off interviewers."
highschoolteachers,"As a HS counselor, all I can say is that kids don’t magically end up in high school. They spend YEARS (literally) in K-8. The foundation they come into HS with is extremely important for their overall success. Getting a job at the elementary or middle school level is probably more - not less- important. Getting a job at the MS is not “lowering” standards. Try again..."
highschoolteachers,"Okay, thanks for your help though. I guess I shouldn’t worry anymore since we’ve left high school now."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; What will they do when they reach capacity for the day? Turn students away at the door?
&gt; 

The school is generating a sign up system online for parents who wants the kids to attend. Students who did not sign up with be turned away from the door. Priority will be given to 1) students whose parents are essential workers and 2) students who have IEPs and require additional support. 

&gt;You're in high school, too, so I assume the students switch classes. Are you expected to sanitize desks and other surfaces during the passing period?

We're doing 2 classes in the mornings and the afternoon is for online learning. After the first class, students are to sanitize their area and leave the building, then we allow the second batch in (it's up to you if you want to make the students sanitize or if you want to do it yourself). 

&gt;Thanks for sharing, and stay safe.

To you as well!"
highschoolteachers,"What will they do when they reach capacity for the day? Turn students away at the door?

You're in high school, too, so I assume the students switch classes. Are you expected to sanitize desks and other surfaces during the passing period?

Very curious how schools will hand all these variables. Thanks for sharing, and stay safe."
highschoolteachers,"This would be a poor use of taxpayer dollars.   School districts should be able to allocate funds as their districts sees fit - I would be furious if my school had $10,000 to spend on theater and they gave it to a kid instead of taking the entire school to a broadway show. 

This is the kind of idea that high school me would come up with stoned."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you :) 
I teach little ones so some of them still don't fully understand or can't fully process what is going on, but I definitely feel that they would prefer to see their friends and be in the classroom. I see middle years and high school teachers who really feel like they are pointless and their classroom is full of crickets. I hope you have said at least a little something to your teachers about how you miss them. We care so much about this job and our students and it truly means the world to hear that we are appreciated."
highschoolteachers,"All schools in my district are schedule to open on June 1st as a trial run for September. Return for students is optional and up to the parents. We're enforcing a maximum of 20%-25% (depends on elementary or secondary) student capacity which for my particular high school translates to 4 students per class.  

Instead of making every entrance/exit available, the school has two designated entrances to keep track of how many students are in the building. A single hand sanitizing station (the district is providing us with a limited amount of hand sanitizer) is set up, and students are asked to wash their hands when their enter the building and after their class. Hallways are now marked with direction arrows to indicate the direction of travel to avoid congregation. Bathrooms have a one occupancy rule and waiting areas are marked. 

Will students actually follow along with all these new protocols? Maybe. I'm fortunate to be at a school with pretty respectful students, and the limited number of students will make this easy to manage. Am I still concerned about my safety? Definitely, but I know at least that my admin has put a lot of thought into this and are doing their best."
highschoolteachers,"That sounds wonderful. I’m in AZ and education is a joke. We are treated like trash. I feel like a high schooler when I go to work. It’s so sad. I’m ashamed to be a teacher because of the way we are treated. And salaries don’t go up. If you change districts, you start at the first salary step all over again, regardless of your experience. The steps are not big increases and you don’t start stepping up until after probation. It’s literally not worth it at all unless you get a PhD. And that costs a fortune and is a luxury that most can not afford. 

The schools purposefully hire newbies so they can control them. They of course quit immediately. My first school, in the science department the first year, the turnover was ridiculous. We had new people every few months. Some of the students literally had 3-4 different teachers through the year. Several teachers were working uncertified! 

AZ education is a nightmare and is not fixable with reform. It needs revolutionary-style rebuilding. It’s so broken."
highschoolteachers,"I think OP is concerned about the face masks? Not being able to identify students on the cameras if something were to happen. 

I work at a very large high school (3000+) and at least a few times a week admin sends out screenshots from the cameras of students for teachers to identify because they were possibly involved in or witnessed something- usually vaping in bathrooms. So I can understand the apprehension of having everyone wear face masks. Maybe OP is worried the masks could give any potential assailants confidence because their face is hidden."
highschoolteachers,"They really can’t. That’s why I gave up right off the bat. The monthly was higher than my income and the interest was at 10-14%. I make 47K at my high school. After all the massive deductions from my check, I was bringing home $2436 a month. My loan payment was ~$2680. 

People have literally told me to get a second job... I’d ask, “so I have to somehow find a job that is way below part time and still make another 47K a year? Yeah right. If people could do that, we’d all be living very very well off.”

I could work every moment of my life without sleep and I still wouldn’t make the 90K needed to afford these loans and the high cost of living. Plus, I find it ridiculous that I’m told to pay them but not save any money. So when crisis hits (like when my car breaks down, or I get COVID, or something else, I’d have no money to cover that and bankrupt or end up homeless regardless. Students loans are a lose-lose my all measures."
highschoolteachers,"My licensure is Earth Science 7-12 in NYS. I teach middle school general science, which is a mixture of different sciences. I had no issue finding a general science job with my license, but you are typically competing against biology certified teachers (nearly every MS teacher is biology in my experience). My grad school peers mostly went into high school and found jobs without too much trouble because of the Regents, so Earth Science is offered at many schools but not many people are certified.  It’s common for biology certified teachers to be given earth science. I don’t know about other states but in NY there is definitely demand for Earth Science, but there’s more demand for chem/physics."
highschoolteachers,"Look.  This isn't going to be a popular post.  And yes I get it, we are going to be a in shitty, fucked up, horrible situation with piss poor leadership and no real plan.

That being said....  We are needed.   There is a hidden crisis going on right now for adolescents. The suicide rates for young kids is really high now.   There is so much depression and mental health issues going on with these kids stuck in this fucked up unnatural condition.   I cannot imagine how much worse this will be if we continue it into the fall.   Our kids are more fragile than we realize and we will lose kids we didn't have to if we don't have *something*

Im not even talking about those kids who come from abusive homes who BEFORE this school was their only refuge.  Now their parents are going through economic stress.  This is a fucking nightmare for them.   

Me?  Im a high school teacher in a city school, but also the parent of 12 year old boy who is battling depression and I'm doing everything I can to keep him active and going.  At the same time I'm getting these increasingly sad emails from my students who are going through very tough times, and even worse, more and more students on the edges are drifting away, I'll probably never see them in a classroom again.

We are not disposable.  We are a critical cog in our society and if we cannot figure something out we are going to witness the loss and destruction of an entire generation long after this pandemic is over.

Also, for context, something that broke my heart and made me realize we have got to get back to life, but safely.

highschoolteachers,"NOVA (northern Virginia) is a very diverse part of the state, and as of this year the state passed new non-discrimination legislation. There are definitely some very white parts of the area, but there are plenty of more diverse areas (I teach at a majority minority high school). 

The counties in NOVA are huge and are always looking for teachers. It's an expensive area to live, and densely populated, but as a single male I've had no difficulty surviving on what I make."
highschoolteachers,"I'm hearing a lot of conflicting messages from admin types. This a good time to practice one's reading-between-the-lines skills, I suppose. Try to figure out what your really admin wants, and do that.

For example, our principal advised us to consider how a student was doing in your class before the virus. I interpret that to mean that if a student was passing before the virus, they probably should be passing at the end of the year.

I don't have a problem with that. Distance ""learning"" has pretty much taken most of the learning out of school, imo. I teach in a high school where damn near half the kids are at risk. It's a colossal challenge to get them to learn in analog classroom, to think they will respond to staring a computer screen is farcical. 

Even if I thought differently, the best thing is to do what my admin really wants at this point. It's all about survival right now."
highschoolteachers,"No way in July. My kid was asked to do summer school. He apparently qualified for K level (honors) math. Well he wasn’t in that in 7th grade so to catch up he has to do summer school before 8th grade. With 8th grade k math apparently he gets high school credit.

Anyway summer school is June/July. It is online. He’s also doing strength and conditioning athletic camp through the high school he feeds to so I’ll be interested in what kind of precautions they have although my worry level is extremely minimal.

I guess they could change to early August instead of late August but I doubt it."
highschoolteachers,"Then they go to college, fail for not doing work, and blame high school teachers."
highschoolteachers,"I have no recommendations for books but will happily share my experience.

First, I'm curious what level of buy-in will you have from your colleagues, admin, and district? That will define your experience. I'm in a district that is moving 100% to SBG in an entirely top-down fashion, so my experience will be vastly different from someone who is moving to SBG in their own classroom out of their own genuine curiosity. I don't know how to distinguish between ""standards based grading"" and ""my own district's application of standards based grading,"" so forgive me if I say something that's specific to my district and needs additional context. Feel free to ask questions and I'll be happy to follow up.

In my district, we are moving to get to the point where all ages K–12 will have their grades be entirely based on standards. In the elementary and middle schools, we are abolishing letter grades altogether, but in high school, we are keeping letter grades to maintain compatibility with the rest of the nation (but are pushing to have those grades be tied to standards instead of whatever a teacher may choose).

We use the standard 4-tiered scale. The first thing is to learn that this is not a 4 *point* scale. Everyone wants to treat them as ""points"" which is wrong and frustrating to deal with. Correcting students' and parents' incorrect intuition will become your life.

* Level 1: No mastery
* Level 2: Partial mastery
* Level 3: Meets expectations (the goal)
* Level 4: Advanced/mastery

Expect absolutely no buy-in from parents whatsoever. Especially if you're doing it on your own, make sure either (1) you are simply dipping your toes in the water and not upending the traditional grading model too much, or (2) you are an untouchable veteran teacher willing to make this the hill you die on. Grading is such a huge part of education, for better or for worse, and SBG rocks the boat well beyond an amount that gets the attention of every single parent and student.

Expect very difficult conversations with every single kind, hard-working, straight-A student. We all have *tons* of straight-A students who are used to ""playing the game"" of school—they know how to turn work in on time, complete test corrections after their tests, resubmit assignments for additional points back, whatever. They're not used to being told that they're currently sitting at a level-3 understanding on a 4-level scale, representing that they have met expectations in a standard but have not reached mastery. They will interpret that to mean that they are being given a 75%, even though they did all of the work they've been asked to do, which they see as unfair. (Their entire educational career until that point has taught them the importance of ""playing the game"" which is the craft that they've mastered, so I have sympathy with them—yes, it really is unfair.)

When discussing SBG with colleagues, admin, or parents, expect for every single person to want to use the conversation as an opportunity to shoehorn in their own philosophy on grades, and expect everyone to be using different definitions of things and interpreting everything differently. Have you ever listened to two people discuss politics, and one person says ""socialism is bad, just look at Venezuela"" and the other person says ""socialism is good, just look at Finland,"" and you've thought to yourself ""um, I think you guys might be using two different definitions of the word 'socialism,' but that's none of my business?"" No one will have the same philosophical understanding of what a ""level 3"" is or what a ""level 4"" is. People will want to spend the bulk of the conversation talking about their own philosophies on grading instead of working towards a shared definition of what is meant by ""level 3"" or ""level 4.""

If admin gets involved, expect clueless implementations that completely miss the point. I've had an administrator tell an entire school that all teachers *must* tie all grades directly to standards, and simultaneously tell an entire school that we *must* reduce the numbers of D's and F's. These are completely, 100% contradictory. A huge feature of SBG is that it takes grading decisions out of teachers' hands and ties it to more universal standards. The admin team literally ran reports of which teachers had the most F's and would confront them about it.

&gt; &gt; Why do you have so many students on track to fail this quarter?
&gt; 
&gt; Because I've adopted the standards and rubrics set forth by my department, and all of these students are objectively at a 'level 1' according to those rubrics. Maybe it's a terrible class, or maybe I'm a bad teacher compared to my colleagues. Either way, these students are objectively at a 'level 1' (here are the assessments to prove it) and their performance is being assessed in the exact same way as other students, so even if it's a bit worrisome, it's at least fair and consistent which is a major goal/feature of SBG.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You need to give fewer F's.

That same admin team also unilaterally created a scale that said that a ""level 3"" should translate to a ""B,"" with no input from teachers or the community and with no consistency among other schools. This is a deep philosophical issue about what a grade *should* represent (if you have to have them at all); instead of being discussed at-length by all stakeholders, the answer was drafted up in an afternoon and thrown onto all teachers. There are many other philosophical discussions to be had, and none of them will be had.

Expect to have difficulty with classroom behavior without being able to use grades as a carrot/stick, at least until you figure out a new paradigm. No extra credit, no participation points, no points off for late work. Philosophically it's perhaps not ideal to have to tie those things to a grade, but for better or for worse every teachers has managed student behavior by using their classroom grades. IMO grades have historically been an important tool for teacher autonomy—*you* get to pick *your* grading philosophy based on how *you* teach, how *you* assess, how *you* manage student behavior, etc. If there are new expectations thrown on you, your grading philosophy can be adjusted to incorporate the new stuff. But by tying grades to only standards, everything else about your teaching needs to find a new way to be enforced. If you can't lower a student's homework score when they refuse to do homework, what are you going to do instead to motivate that student? Odds are it requires a cohesive approach from the entire school, or district, or community, and it *certainly* means you need admin or counseling to be on your side when you have an issue with a student. It also means much more work on your end. Instead of just lowering the kid's grade, you now need to loop in all the kid's other teachers, counseling, parents, etc. to find a new solution. Maybe that's a good thing—it forces those types of issues to come to the forefront so that they can actually be addressed, but it requires an incomprehensible amount of time. I would estimate that the average teacher at our school spends maybe an hour peer week before/after school in intervention meetings with counselors/parents/admin/etc. to address things like a student's late work habit or whatever else. (Keep in mind we're talking about squeezing many meetings per week into short amounts of time before/after school, so any time you have a meeting that means you won't be getting anything else done that morning or afternoon. Do you ever make copies in the morning? Not anymore you don't.) It's a hell of a lot more time than we get per week to sit down with our PLCs. It's also just not as effective as simply giving partial credit for late work or giving a certain number of late passes per quarter or something.

I think I'm probably approaching the character limit so I'll stop there. Overall my impression is quite negative on moving an entire district to it and I think it's a solution looking for a problem. Let teachers grade how they want to grade, or abolish grades altogether, and put the tens of thousands of dollars of saved consultant fees towards hiring another teacher."
highschoolteachers,"I enjoy teaching To Kill a Mockingbird and The Tell-Tale Heart. I'd love to teach Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, The Glass Castle, or a Raisin in the Sun. In middle school, I loved Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. In high school, I enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, and couldn't believe they'd actually let us read a book with gay characters (the 90s were a dark time)."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for telling me about your experiences. It is very valuable to hear about it, and I find your perspective on teaching being more about the pedagogy than the content a good perspective to take even though I don't often think about it that way. Being in an elementary school really gave you new challenges and changed your perspective on literacy, and it made you able to work with many different varieties of students.

As to why I don't want to do elementary, I value being able to teach in a way that allows the students to develop their ability to show insight into what they are learning and make new discoveries through the research and inquiry process. I want to go into depth about what we are covering and make the topics come alive to the students. I do not want to spend my instructional time singing songs, playing games, and doing social-emotional activities that aren't relevant to what we are learning. In addition, I want to be able to give students the opportunity to participate in the learning process and creatively displaying their knowledge, something I don't think they can do sophisticatedly at the lower elementary level. I'm against patronizing students in any way, which I think is necessary at times at the elementary level because they don't have the attention span to focus on lessons in the same way that middle school and high school students do. 

But to some extent, my dislike could be because I don't really know what they do in elementary (especially K-3) outside of my experiences as a student 11-16 years ago, talking to my former neighbor's children, and brief chats with customers who have young kids at my grocery store job. I have had roughly 15 hours of observation in an urban elementary school library before. The students were very rowdy and the school librarian was perhaps a little too strict with them. I did not like the experience. I enjoyed the 10 hour urban middle school and 10 hour suburban high school observation I did, plus the two weeks of observation I did at another suburban high school right before COVID-19 shut everything down. I expect my student teaching placement department will put me with an elementary school library at least part of the time to build broader teaching experiences (and also because they know I don't like it and they want to push me out of my comfort zone a little bit), so I recognize my assessment might change."
highschoolteachers,"I mean I don’t personally know any high school students aside from the ones I teach and I wouldn’t be comfortable having a teenager watch my kid for 45 hours a week. Also, wouldn’t the teenagers have schoolwork to do? My school did 10 live classes each week which would have overlapped with many parents’ work schedules. I don’t see why teenagers should be filling the childcare gap when there are highly qualified professionals available to provide some sort of childcare. I’m not saying open schools willy nilly with no forethought but schools DO provide high quality childcare and there is no other system set up to handle the millions of children that need high quality childcare right now."
highschoolteachers,"I teach in an urban high school within a city that's been hit absurdly hard by COVID. Probably 20-30%+ of the population has gotten it.

I would like to see an morning shift and an afternoon shift. Group 1 comes from 8 to 11AM-ish, Group 2 from 12:30 to 3:30 or some approximately. In between is sanitation time.

Why?

* Remote learning isn't working for our students, for a number of reasons. I teach newcomer ELLs and learning on a computer isn't doing it. Too many tech issues as well, from getting kids hotspots to figuring out how to use them.
* Many of our students work to support their families, moreso than before as people have been laid off. It was bad before but it will be worse now.
* Similarly, many students are caretakers for younger siblings -- less time in the classroom means they can help at home. (note: I have no ideas what to do for younger kids)
* By splitting classes in half, I might actually be able to keep students 6 feet apart.
* Smaller class sizes will help students re-acclimate to school, stop us from ripping our hair out.
* We don't have to worry about taking care of the cafeteria and other large congregating spaces -- hallways will have plenty of space for students to maneuver, they'll go to class then go home (and take bagged lunch to go).
* I sure as shit am not letting students eat in my room (I'm deathly allergic to food they like to eat that is a frequent part of school lunch)."
highschoolteachers,"This reminds me of the time I was my student's bartender. 

(I teach part time at a community college in addition to my high school teaching)"
highschoolteachers,"Not the OP, but I occasionally do homemade cookies as a group reward for a class period. I verify with the class what my plan will be, and any students who can't eat it can talk to me on an alternative.I teach high school and occasionally have a kid who can't eat whatever treat, and I ask them to chose something else like a pack of gum, candy bar, or bag of chips/pretzels. I agree with you that it is typically not a big deal."
highschoolteachers,"You can probably get alternative certification.  Check around your area for programs.  If you have a community college, it's there.  Think two semesters of educational pedagogy and you pass some standardized tests.  You likely do not need a full Masters in Education unless you want it (district-dependent).

The bad news is the world is full of potential middle and high school English teachers.  Hard job to get.  Consider substituting, if you can afford it, to get your foot in the door, then start working those connections.  Get certified in anything you can.

The district you live in almost certainly has an HR website.  Look at it and see what's available for the next month or two.  Watch the teacher job sausage get made."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, as a 25yo teacher, the things I wish most that my partner understood about me and my life is that she doesn’t understand the ins and outs of the profession. There are several things that while I vent about them, are the nature of the situation. I work in the epitome of customer service and there are several injustices and annoyances that I just plain have to put up with, that all teachers have to put up with.

Also, as a high school teacher, I spend all of my time around teenagers and it uses up all of my emotional energy for childishness. Teachers by nature expend so much emotional energy dealing with children that we rely on being able to be surrounded by maturity when we get home. Adults who act immature are likely to be a pet peeve (this could just be me) so just keep that in mind.

For the most part, we all just need someone we can really unwind with after a hard day, which looks very different from a hard day for other professions."
highschoolteachers,"I have researched this and perhaps it will work for me. Currently I am most interested in teaching high school, and this program seems to accredit you to teach anywhere up until the 8th grade. However I am definitely trying to stay open-minded and flexible during this process! And I admit that it's possible my hopes lean towards high school only because that's what's freshest in my memory.

Thank you!!!"
highschoolteachers,"Offer hazard pay to a few teachers who volunteer or perhaps already have Corona antibodies determined by testing and allow only students of ABSOLUTELY essential workers under a certain age (I see no reason high schoolers can't stay at home) to a modified, socially distance school, and keep everyone else online. Stop defining essential workers as literally everyone. Give hazard pay to essential workers (which has stopped). In my state everyone is apparently essential as almost everything has opened up. No, hair stylists are not essential. Keep people who can't work on a reasonable amount of UI until we've shown an actual decrease in cases. Have an actual plan. Enforce mask wearing and distancing. None of this is happening in my state."
highschoolteachers,If parents want to opt out they should just dis-enroll and register for online public school. Distance learning is not like online learning. I have a kid in each and there is a world of difference. I am thankful my daughter will go into her junior year of HS with zero interruption to her curriculum. She has done online for last two years. My son on the other hand is in the same boat as his brick and mortar peers as he enters high school in the fall. His school day currently is maybe two hours of “online” work. That’s it.
highschoolteachers,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Often whatever change you might make won't have an effect until they leave high school and enter the real world.  A lot of people grow up to realize what they thought as a teenager was horrible.  Give it time and have hope.  Present facts to students and hope over time they come around."
highschoolteachers,"There is a certification process. Google “AP College Board certification” Though some schools, depending on desperation, will overlook the rules and let people not certified teach. I taught AP environmental without a certification. 

Though I’ll be the pessimist here and let you know right now that it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to land a position that is all AP. In the best case scenario, you’ll get one AP class. And being new, the teachers who have been there longer will get those classes first. Expect to teach on-level shitty kids in high school."
highschoolteachers,"When I did it I believe my school just has to approve me teaching the course and add it to their schedule. Then they may send you to some training or an AP conference. Anecdotally though, I'd say most principals want you to get some experience at the high school level and get through your probationary teaching period before they start adding classes for you and handing you the honors kids. A lot of people like teaching those courses and sometimes you kind of have to pay your dues and get some sway with your department first as well. Good luck! High school is fun."
highschoolteachers,I was hoping so. My high school had a meteorology class in itself but I'm willing to guess most schools will likely not have it built in the budget. There were only 9 other kids in my class when I took it and it would be tough to get a whole classroom full. Fingers crossed though!
highschoolteachers,"How do create an inclusive and cohesive school environment?

What would you do if a student was displaying threatening and unsafe behaviors in class?

Have you co-taught?

What would be your process of creating a transition plan for a high school student?

How would you work with students to increase test scores?

How do you build and maintain relationships with parents?

How would you work with the community to provide both academic and social-emotional growth?"
highschoolteachers,"The most eye-opening part for me was the photo of the sidewalk with circles sprayed at 6 foot intervals. At my crowded high school, there would be 30 students in that space."
highschoolteachers,"In general, and in most states, science teachers are commonly in demand. The fact that you have science degree instead of a teaching degree also helps in case teaching does not work out for you, or if you want to leave the profession.

Depending on the grade level you want to teach at, will most likely mean you will have to get a credential/certification in a specific field of science. At the middle school level we are teaching more foundational science versus at the high school level where it is more focus on either life, earth, or physical science. Though I have been at high schools where they did not care which science specialty you had as long as you have some kind of science content background and can teach other science areas. 

You might want to also jump to /r/scienceteachers"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;How would you respond in this scenario?

I would recap for the parent the outreach efforts I made to the parent to alert him or her to the fact homework was not being completed over the past several weeks.

This way, the parent is unlikely to complain at all about a situation I've kept them informed about. This is doubly true during a school closure because students are not acclimated to online learning (it's not for everyone!) on top of the stress the student is experiencing from sheltering in place.

Edit: My own studious, epically responsible, was-on-track-for-valedictorian straight-A high school student began slipping. Two of her teachers had radically different methods. The first one communicated nothing. My child is now making up a month's worth of homework (that she was lying to me about) after I logged into the school website to check her progress. 

The second teacher e-mailed me after the first week of missed assignments, we got caught up, and the teacher hooked me into Google Classroom e-mail notifications that tell me when homework is not completed. The non-communicative teacher has not done this for me."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a teacher in South Africa, and we were sent back to school this week with two grades--our matrics (grade 12; last year of high school) and our grade 7s (last year of primary school)--joining on Monday. 

The 'lockdown' (local version of a stay at home order) has not been lifted in our country though. A lessening of restrictions is being implemented from Monday due to the fact that other sectors of the economy are being reopened.

I believe that the reason that we have been sent back is to essentially be babysitters. We have been given so little information as to what the changed curriculum will be, as well as when we can expect the next wave of learners to be sent to school that I feel that the government doesn't really care what we do with the learners as long as they social distance at a place that isn't home. 

It feels as though we are being sent forward as combination guinea pigs and babysitting service."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school, 93 was a B+, but it was a 70-100 grading scale.  94 was an A-.  But, we also didn't have online gradebooks.  Teachers just assigned grades as they saw fit and you accepted them (this sounds old and grumpy).

To the OP, you're the teacher, do what you want.  But, you have to accept that other people may be unhappy with you, including student, parents, guidance, and admin.  Hope you documented everything and enjoy contentious meetings.

Is it a battle worth fighting?"
highschoolteachers,"It's extremely hard not to move onto the next grade in elementary and middle school in my district. In some situations, you need explicit consent of the parent to retain their kid, which is never going to happen.

The real wake up call occurs freshman year, and now graduating and moving on depends on their grades. So a kid that fell behind in elementary school and completely fucked around in middle school is now trying to tackle high school level work with an elementary school education."
highschoolteachers,"Could you speak a little more to this? I have really bad asthma and don’t want to return to teaching during covid. My undergrad degree is in business and I have a MAT.

I want to get into programming as I took AP Computer Science in high school and enjoyed it. I’ve looked at boot camps but have heard so many mixed things. As someone who hires people for these jobs, what would you recommend a teacher do to get their foot in the door? Salary doesn’t really matter to me and I’d be happy to start at entry level."
highschoolteachers,"Minnesota high school. 

Nope. Not a single time."
highschoolteachers,"I live on a substitute paycheck, so a lot less than a full teacher salary. Definitely living within my means. Lol. Two roommates, not spending a whole lot, putting money away for the summer. I work in the same district I went to school in, and I know three of my younger male high school teachers lived together in their first couple years."
highschoolteachers,Do you have go-to sites for high school ELA?
highschoolteachers,"There are definitively different viewpoints that come into play with younger students.  My perspective is from high school and seeing how kids act at that age.  I don't think all of my concerns disappear with the real young ones, but I could image you don't have to worry about 5 year olds recording friends on their iphone (at least I really hope not....).  The classroom dynamic and what it means to be in the classroom certainly changes from 5 years old to 16 years old."
highschoolteachers,"The best way to handle that would be to as someone else said keep middle school and high school students at distance learning and use all of their facilities as elementary classrooms. That would dramatically help with the reduction of class sizes and deal with the childcare issue (maybe also have those older students with special needs also come in for that reason). Of course, in order to do that we’d need a much bigger budget in order to hire a bunch more staff (which will probably only be temporary since they’ll be gone more or less once we go back to normal). So I don’t see that happening."
highschoolteachers,"I 100% believe that food has no place in the classroom unless the class is actually about food.  

If it isn't a science classroom (or against a teachers personal classroom rules) and a student wants to bring their own snack, that is fine, but a teacher bringing food is unnecessary and I've rarely seen a reason for it other than 'cool points' or bribery.  I get that it is an easy way to earn brownie points with students but to me it is just that, the easy way and not a way that is at all meaningful.  

 It starts to teach bad food habits (food = reward), sets an expectation that teachers should be spending money like that on students, and also isolates.  In the era of smartphones where everyone has a camera, I know of 3 instances where an obese student was filmed eating and the video shared to make fun of the student.  Plus the big one to me, why are we putting students in a situation where they have to disclose their medical history, religious beliefs, or personal diet choices to the entire class of students so we can be cool? (And while some high school students would accept a 'I just don't want any', just as many will pester a person for an actual answer - and not necessarily in a malicious way)"
highschoolteachers,"Social studies was always my favorite subject growing up and I had some particularly great social studies teachers who inspired me to take the jump into education. 

I didn’t set out to become a middle school teacher. I always envisioned myself teaching high school but student taught and then long term subbed in 8th grade. Learned how to work with and enjoy the age group so I tailored my job search process toward middle schools and hopped on my first offer which was a vacancy in 7th grade."
highschoolteachers,"So much this! My school coded in 'internships' into 4th quarter for any student who had to up their work hours (or become primary daytime caretaker for younger siblings).  All the parent had to do was reach out to guidance and guidance took care of all it.  If a students working hours changed mid pandemic, students were put into 'internship' for the last 1/8 of the year.  This information was given to parents in the superintendents communication, principal's communication, guidance bulletin, edconnect phone call, and by letter home to all high school students. All of these outlined the process by which parents needed to follow (essentially email guidance)  Now with 2.5 weeks left I am having parents email me that 'their baby' has been working this whole time and they need to be retroactively added to this program so they don't have to make up work."
highschoolteachers,We do it every day and I’m at a high school.
highschoolteachers,"Arizona, the high school i long term sub at does it but most kids just stand up and not say it. The younger kids usually say it."
highschoolteachers,What about staff? Would high school teachers have to do something with ES kids? Then who'd teach the high schoolers online? It'd be my nightmare to have to teach or supervise ES kids honestly.
highschoolteachers,"Out of curiosity, why are you so dead-set against elementary?

I ask because when I first started looking for teaching jobs, I was sure that I wanted to teach high school ELA or Social Studies, but would unenthusiastically accept 8th grade - definitely not younger. I wanted to teach content that excited me - whether it be history with nuance or texts with depth. I wanted material to spark deep, Socratic discourse. 

My training year, I was placed into 6th grade ELA. The following year, I was moved into 4th grade Reading. That was five years ago, and I'm still doing that (though I added Writing into the fold this year). Why? Well, one thing I've learned is that, no matter the name of your subject, *your* field of study is *how kids learn it*. 

In the case of elementary ELA, thats litera*cy*. By high school, at least insofar as the standards are concerned, that's more litera*ture*. Coming out of college, I was certain that my interest in the former far exceeded my interest in the latter. Now, it's the reverse: litera*cy* is a massive, terrible, beautiful, dark and deep monster full of utterly fascinating mystery and challenge. 

I teach fourth grade, and, after several years of seeing younger students from afar, I'm comfortable saying that I would prefer not to teach younger than that. Also, after a year in a middle school, I'm comfortable saying that I would prefer to not teach sixth grade again, and probably not seventh, either. I do still have some curiosity about eighth grade and above, but would only pursue such a change if/when I become bored with 4th grade or simply fed up with the direction my district academics team has been going. (From what I can tell, students and content in fifth grade are pretty similar to those in 4th, but where I am, 5th is middle school, and I wouldn't want to make such a drastic environmental change without getting to experience new content and pedagogy.)

However, even if I *do* end up switching to high school, I can say one thing with certainty, with regard to my time in elementary: I'll be a better teacher for it."
highschoolteachers,"I 100% agree with this sentiment.  My teacher friends and I literally were told to change the entire graduation venue last year at the last minute (One of my friends was the senior advisor, I just help out because I primarily teach seniors.)  We were able to get another high school in NYC that has an airplane hangar to let us have the ceremony at their school.  We showed up, had to put literally hundreds of seats in place.  During the actual graduation, everyone else got a shout out except for us.  The AP's, deans, everyone got a thank you from the principal.  Just not the people who ACTUALLY made the ceremony happen."
highschoolteachers,"When I graduated teachers college I went back to my old high school to talk to my favorite teacher and  asked him what advice he would give me as a new teacher: draw hard lines with your life and this job. It is one of the few that will ask you for everything and still say it is not enough.

I'm still a relatively new teacher, but I have seen just how many colleagues work themselves to death. They coach an academic team in the fall and a physical sport in spring, run after school help, and sacrifice their lunches and breaks.

It seems to be only getting worse."
highschoolteachers,"Student teacher here! Our final placement was cancelled and we were left to do independent study/ prep for next year. While you don’t need to do anything, if you want to keep busy, I would suggest:

+ expanding your subject knowledge: will you be teaching outside your specialism? Any interesting/fun facts to hook your pupils in? Study the exam specifications and national curriculums - what do your kids need to know and so what do you need to know?

+ reading first hand accounts and classroom theory: there are some great books on teaching and pedagogy, have a look through and pick out a few (check if your local library does ebooks or if you can find them for free online)

+ CPD: there are quite a few cpd courses for free online, depending on your age group/subject (for the uk: futurelearn, open uni, Seneca learning...)

+keep up to date on social distancing classrooms and online learning from current teachers: all over the world teachers are adapting and sharing their experiences. Learn from others 

+ making resources: much harder if you don’t know your students/ don’t have much experience yourself. Have a think about you’d age group- are there any generic / easily adaptable resources you can make? For example, I’m a high school science teacher so I made a massive glossary of key words sorted by topic for my different classes- not sure how I’m going to use it but will be useful in the future.

This all being said, try not to stress. We honestly don’t know what September will look like (and that definitely depends on your country!) your university and placement school will look after you and give you the best training they can. My university are preparing so hard for next years trainee teachers with so many different plans depending on the lockdown status- even if they are not ready to share with you them yet formally have faith. Next year is going to be tough no matter what for it takes so be kind to yourself this summer xx"
highschoolteachers,"As someone who thinks proof is an essential part of math, I'm really sorry to hear that. I think it'd be like if I said that I like CS because I like writing code, but I don't bother with checking if it works or debugging.

Have you ever taken a discrete math course or a math for CS course? [MIT 6.042J is a great online one here.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/index.htm)

Problem-solving (solving unfamiliar, challenging problems) and proof are the two activities at the heart of mathematics, but so many students never get to experience them in math class. I think one of the biggest problems with math education in the U.S. is that there's too much to teach and not enough time.

I like what mathematician and ex-NFL player John Urschel said in a [NYT opinion piece:](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/sunday/math-teaching-football.html)

&gt;Until I got to college, I didn’t really know what mathematics was. I still thought of it as problem sets and laborious computations. Then one day, one of my professors summoned me to his office, handed me a book and suggested that I think about a particular problem. Understanding it, I realized, required reading other, more elementary books. I would make my way down one path only to hit a dead end. It wasn’t easy, but it was fascinating.
My professor kept giving me problems, and I kept pursuing them, even though I couldn’t always solve them immediately. Before long, he was introducing me to problems that had never been solved before, and urging me to find new techniques to help crack them.
The mathematical research I was doing had little in common with what I did in my high school classrooms. Instead, it was closer to the math and logic puzzles I did on my own as a boy. It gave me that same sense of wonder and curiosity, and it rewarded creativity.
I am now a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and I have published several papers in mathematical journals. I still feel that childlike excitement every time I complete a proof.
I wish I’d known this was possible when I was a kid."
highschoolteachers,I write these kids a letter so I have time to think it over. For example last year I had a student I taught every year of her high school journey so that deserved a letter.
highschoolteachers,"Firstly, I teach in Norway. I chose subjects based on what I liked in school myself. English, Social studies/Civics and History, and I'm currently studying Religion, philosophies of life and ethics (mandatory subject elementary and middle school and one year in high school). I chose to teach high school because I think I connect well with teens/young adults. But the main reasoning is that I don't have the guts to teach younger kids, I don't want to mess up the kids' basic learning. I'd rather try to ""fix"" some else's messes and/or put the finishing touches on the gems the kids are before I send them out into the world ☺️ 

As I teach at a vocational high school, I only teach English and Social studies/Civics. History is part of the supplementary course for those students who change their mind, and want to go to a university. And Religion (RPE) is a subject at the university prep courses. But, I've applied for positions at other schools in those subjects, so fingers crossed."
highschoolteachers,"I had a parent tell me if she was younger she'd be waiting out in the parking lot for me, then goes into a rant about how no one in the school system gives a shit and we're all in it for a paycheck. With two admin in the room. And her daughter. Admin didn't say a word. 



Funnily enough, I got another reprimand the next week and was asked to resign, which I did. I now work the same job the parent (who mentioned how she didn't have a high school diploma and that's why she was fighting so hard for her kid). So I think the parent won that altercation."
highschoolteachers,"I love math. And I taught at a middle school and they wanted me to decorate the walls in themes. Seemed very silly to me and I know these students are coming from an elementary school, so I'm teaching high school now. They still want me to decorate the walls, but at least they don't expect childish themes."
highschoolteachers,"Ohio. We do it every morning in my district from K-12. 

That said, I also worked in another school district that stopped doing it after 8th grade.

Back in the day, we did it every morning until I got to high school.

Considered independently, the Pledge is ridiculous. On the other hand, it’s 20 seconds out of your day and doesn’t bind you to a position for life."
highschoolteachers,"Greatly depends on the area, I'm in Texas. Here, it is directly related to your campus level, middle school principals and APs make more than elementary, and high school makes more than middle school. APs also can be 11 month, 11.5 month, or 12 month which will affect pay. A 12 month elementary AP would start around 65k, while a high school AP would start around 76k. Elementary principals would start around 85k, and high school principals would start around 105k. Find the middle ground between the two and that's where middle schools are."
highschoolteachers,"Student here: My school has a policy that states that if you turn in a paper after the marking period is over, it doesn't get counted (exceptions being in place for people with IEPs and 504s and the such). It just becomes a zero in the grade book, and nobody can do anything about it. At least, that's our high school and middle school's rules. It might be different for elementary I guess, but I didn't pay attention to policy back then."
highschoolteachers,"That's why I went with the math minor!  I knew it would be harder to find a job teaching English even though that's what I'd prefer.  I wanted to keep my options open. The principal at the high school I substituted at last year said was crazy for going for both, but that I better give her a call, so I probably ought to do that. I did substitute a lot in the English department I want to work in this last year though (same school), and I know there is an opening or two, so I'm really hoping I can get in there. 

 I already passed the 4-8 math certification because my alt-cert program didn't offer the 7-12, so maybe having the middle school cert will give the high school some amount of confidence I can pass the high school one as well.  I guess I could also teach middle school, but I really wouldn't prefer that.  As a first year teacher and alternative candidate at that, I won't be too picky though.  Any job in my preferred district is probably a winner."
highschoolteachers,"Like others have said, it varies by state and area. I got my master's degree and leveraged that into a teacher specialist type role where I was coaching teachers, then applied to different AP positions. Regardless, most schools are going to want to see ""leadership"" roles as part of your teaching, e.g. department/plc lead, or spearheading some type of initiative as well as at least 3-4 years teaching experience. Then for principals, they generally want to see at least 3-4 years AP experience before you can start applying for principal roles. 

Regardless of all that though, focus on building your professional network and getting to know as many people as possible in your district. One massive disadvantage that teachers have is they are only on their campus, they don't consistently get off campus with others from the district. That was one big advantage I had in my teacher specialist role is we had consistent PDs and meetings throughout the year at campuses around the district, so over the course of two years I met every high school principal and got to know the people in my related position at each campus, including some district personnel as well. This really helped when I started looking for AP jobs."
highschoolteachers,"Is that actually a thing?  I've heard about it, but I have never seen a single copy of that book in over ten years of teaching.  I'm high school, though, so maybe they're over it by the time they get to me."
highschoolteachers,"Ages ago, when I first started teaching, I had a parent go through the phone book and start calling all of the people with MY LAST NAME because she was upset that her child *may* need to be retained for first grade. This was still in Winter, and was just the ""hey, we need to be on the lookout for this"" phone call that I had made earlier that day.

The only reason I knew about this, is that she finally reached my parents who refused to give her my phone number. (And then who called me in a panic about this crazy parent trying to find me. I was in my post-bac class that evening and was really concerned why my parents kept trying to get a hold of me.)

EDIT: If my memory is correct, and the kid wasn't retained elsewhere, they should be graduating high school this year."
highschoolteachers,"Ultra conservative Catholic mom who came from a family that was insanely sexist (we’re talking the kind of family that the men sat at the table and women served the men and sat on buckets outside the perimeter of the table). Her son was in my middle school class and HE DID NO WRONG despite what I would tell her - he called other girls in class bitches, made sexist comments, told us we’re going to hell for reading our science textbooks, and even convinced another student to trick me into going into the technology room as part of an end of the year prank where they tried to tie me up in duct tape and restrain me in the room. This mom tried to tell me to excuse her son from any reading because of Lent, denied any of her child’s wrong doing, blamed everything on the other students, would not discipline her child, asked that we start a boxing class so her child could just get his aggression out on the other kids, and with the end of year prank incident she said I made it up and probably had it coming. She would say all this while trying to portray a demure, sweet nature. 

She tried to get me fired during a board meeting open forum and ended up pulling her son out of school the next year. I joined the union after that board meeting! Last I heard, her son was enrolled in my current district’s alternative education high school. Which is too bad, because he was very bright. I’m sure his mommy’s coddling and his behavior is what turned him down that alternative path. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I’m no longer in that district, but in the neighboring district that takes the students from my previous district once they exit 8th grade (the prior district I worked at only goes K-8.)

Edit: wording/clarity"
highschoolteachers,"I may be wrong, but that's likely because the high schools are massive compared to those other schools - you're gaining a lot of space. I imagine navigating a high school would be overwhelming for a kiddie, though. My own high school is like a maze. Every hallway looks the same. I just walk in circles until I get to my classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I’m sure this varies somewhat in different locations.

In California, from what I’ve seen you usually need to work your way up to become a principal. Teacher &gt; Assistant Principal &gt; Principal. It doesn’t hurt if you have some other experience as a teacher as well (department chair or coordinator of some kind). You usually have to have some sort of educational administration degree too.

I don’t know about the limit to the number of years. One principal in my district has been at a high school for 5+ years, while the principals at my school are rotating every couple of years.

APs usually make $120k-$130k here and the principals are at about $150k if I recall correctly.

You can find a lot of this information by checking job postings and salary schedules on district websites."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. My district is considering turning the high schools into temporary elementary schools, and keeping the high school kids learning at home. It thins out the density of elementary classes (which, in my district, run 25-30 kids), keeps younger kids in school so parents can work and older kids can focus without having to babysit, and reinforces the need for personal responsibility on the older kids.

I don't love it. But it's better than the other options (going back like normal, or alternating days)."
highschoolteachers,"But your comment, while literally true, entirely misses the point.  Broad and deep skill sets make you a better teacher even if you don't directly teach what you studied in your graduate degree.

 My masters is in math and I get credit for it.  And almost 0% of what I learned in my masters or did on my research is something I teach directly in high school.  But my masters gave so much deep domain knowledge in general that it helps me every day.  I really know why things are true at a deeper level than just memorizing formulae.

Someone with a law degree will absolutely be a stronger history and government teacher than they would be without it."
highschoolteachers,"I gave flowers to my high school teachers because two of my teachers helped me stay in school. I didn’t want to go to school because I moved to a new town. I made friends but I didn’t like many of my teachers during my freshman and sophomore year. I had other teachers who cared a lot about the students, and they prepared well for classes. 

One of the teacher is racist and many students did not like her, because she made the TA teaches the class mainly. She popped into other classes during class time to talk to other teachers. She wore tight low cut shirt and mini skirts to school, and I was speechless 😶 about her choice of dress code to work.

Yes, teachers often get neglected of their hard work."
highschoolteachers,I teach at private high school. The amount of times a student has sworn under their breath and not realized I was close enough to hear them is more than I am willing to count.
highschoolteachers,"I have been in the process of going to a flipped classroom with video lessons for homework (less than 20 minutes each) and classroom time focusing on guided practice, discussions, and experiments (high school science). With Covid-19 I just continued to produce the videos, but realized that I always referenced what I was planning to do in class the next day or something to that effect.

I plan to redo a lot of them and post them to a YouTube channel not associated with my work accounts or my actual personal one. I plan to point students towards the videos about topics I created on my own time so that they are not affiliated with my work for my employer."
highschoolteachers,"You could see whether parents are game for the graduating students to return and go next year. That's the plan at my school where 7th and 8th graders raised money for two years to go on a trip that is now canceled. The 8th graders off to high school next year will be coming back, at least some of them.
  ----------
Spend two-thirds of the money on gift certificates to a sports/outdoor store that has something for everyone.

Spend the remaining third on a customized gift.

My pick would be a rethemed version of a simple, popular card game.  It's called [Love Letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbD9-GCV-8w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17) and contains only 17 cards, making it extremely popular among fans to [design their own cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/170334/all-my-love-letter-re-themes-one-place) along a better theme.

For example, put the yearbook photos of 17 teachers and other school employees on the cards. The teacher who leads the kids on their graduation trip would hold the honored slot as the highest numbered card. Go to a dollar store to grab plastic cases, or travel soap holders, to house the decks.

When you're done, you have a game you can use for a lot of other purposes... include copies in school basket raffles, or sell copies as a school fundraiser.

Boardgames and card games are not copyrighted. You can't copy the artwork. You can't copy the instructions word-for-word. But you can design another version of a game that plays exactly like the game you copied as long as it has different artwork and not-copied instructions."
highschoolteachers,"Um, ""It is by far the best literature to exist""?

No. It's not.

It's very immersive, but Tolkien, by his own admission, was not a storyteller. He was an historian, and created this fictional world in order to give it history.

I love the books, but trust me, as a teacher, there's not a lot we can do with them for a class, especially given how much time would be required to get through them. My high school students balk at being given almost any reading, but the three books of the main trilogy total  1296 pages (432+352+512). If I wanted to get through the story in, say, two weeks, so that we could then spend some time talking about them, writing about them, etc, I would have to assign 129 pages per day of reading.

Or, if I limit myself to a 10th grader-friendly 12 pages per evening, it would take us 100 days to get through them, in a 180-day school year.

So, these are the reasons teachers don't use those books."
highschoolteachers,"Doesnt get better in high school. I am tired of emails asking why I marked them absent when they were in class. We didn't have class today! The teacher whose class you were supposed to be in marked you absent. You would know this if you didn't AFK from the computer and saw we weren't even talking about the same subject.

Now you got me started."
highschoolteachers,Can confirm the VA part- I’m from PA and moved down there to teach at a high school. We had a ton of teachers from PA at that school.
highschoolteachers,"I've been doing well in college so far, definitely struggling in stats but i have an 89 so a lot of the time I *think* I'm doing bad and then I get my test grade and it's no so bad.  

It helps that my class is online, so I can pause the lectures and instruction videos so I can make sure I have everything down and it's not as humiliating bc I don't have to raise my hand or ask for clarification which definitely can be nerve wracking at times. And it's the last math class I need to take and then I'm all done with math for the rest of college...thank goodness lol

It also helps that the math class I took in high school was stats so I've already got some background knowledge retained that I can move along successfully. There's also free tutoring at my college I use to my advantage."
highschoolteachers,"I get bored teaching all the time. It's a job. Everyone gets bored at their job sometimes. And I mean ... in terms of intellectual satisfaction, teaching ain't it. I teach high school, which means nothing I ever get to teach or talk about extends beyond the level of high school. Nothing comes close to what I am trained for and have done in my first career as a professor (PhD in comparative literature). So yeah. It's boring."
highschoolteachers,"No offense, but if the bar was raised higher how do you think they would find teachers? Alternative certification programs exist because people don’t stay in teaching. People don’t stay in teaching because they make $15,000-$20,000 less than their peers. 

Teaching requires more education than a BA or BS, yet pays less, and has a much lower ceiling for potential growth than most other fields. You can’t raise the standards before raising the pay. And if you think we need to lower the supply of teachers, please tell that to the hundreds of districts who are relying on long term subs with no certification, or even worse the ones asking high school grads and parents to babysit the classrooms because nobody wants the jobs."
highschoolteachers,"Listen in on conversations of veteran teachers in your building.  I hardly ever hear older faculty complain about working around the clock (this year an exception due to Covid).  Case in point both my wife and I have been teaching 15 years.  We hardly ever bring grading home except maybe a little catch-up on weekends or holidays.  Once you have lessons that work you spend less time making plans freeing up planning time for grading.  That doesn’t mean you don’t refine plans and make new ones, it just means you don’t have to do it every day.  Also you learn over time that not every shred of work needs grading.  Some things you are doing formatively to see if a student gets it or not.  A quick glance over that will tell you where they stand and your comments to the students let them know that you are paying attention to them.  They will still work without a grade because they want the praise and reassurance and don’t want you to assign more practice.  I teach high school bio.  Each section I have roughly 2 graded homeworks, 1 graded lab, 1 graded quiz and 1 graded tests. Now that can vary as on certain topics I may do a project, but that’s it.  5 things to grade per topic (approximately 2 weeks per topic).  There is tons of other ungraded work, lab activities, computer tutorials, at the bells, etc but those are glanced over, commented on, and instruction adapted accordingly.  I think a lot of teachers feel everything needs a grade but in reality most work is a gauge of understanding to adjust your teaching and shouldn’t be summative."
highschoolteachers,"Unfortunately we don’t have a high school in our district; we feed into a high school that’s considered it’s own district. I also don’t totally love my district, but again, I’m not sure I’ll be able to find another job..."
highschoolteachers,"I set a little “4th quarter challenge” for myself to take advantage of warmer weather and getting as much as possible out of the way before summer starts. So...cleaning projects at home and school, just a little at a time. At school I pack things away as much as possible before May, make lists of what to restock or redo before next year, toss out unneeded stuff, etc. My goal is always to have as little as possible left before exam week starts, get everything ordered and inventoried, etc.  Same at home...I like to start the summer with a clean house so I can just focus on the big projects. I ramp up my exercise which helps me downshift from work mindset into summer mode, wash and pack away winter stuff, etc.

Curriculum-wise it’s all about things that can be graded in class. No big papers coming in after the first week of May. I like to do speeches (high school), some group projects (this year we’re doing a board game project to review for exams), and other smaller, more creative things. Socratic sems are good too. I lose tons of kids for sports and other extras during pretty much all of May, so I have to plan for things they can make up at home on their own. Generally, i take a more “we get what we get” attitude after April. I never plan on getting too much done after May begins because there’s so many interruptions, so the big things need to be done by the first of May. It’s much less stressful than trying to fit it all in at the end and being frustrated by all the changes and absences!"
highschoolteachers,"I’ve been working at a Charter high school for 13 years now. We had the regular rotation of TFA for the first 5 years. They were very open about how they were just using it as a resume booster. 

The few I was social with said that med school interviews, grad school interviews, education think tanks would always want to hear more about it.

Luckily, we got a principal who hated the program and that was that. We still have a few who stayed as teachers."
highschoolteachers,"We've been hybrid since October. I survive it by basically teaching it as if it's online/remote for everyone, it's just that some of the kids are actually sitting at desks in my room. They log into the Meet just like the kids at home, follow the lesson on their Chromebooks just like the kids at home, and basically the only difference is that if they have a question or want to answer something, they can just look up and talk directly too me instead of needing to unmute and ask in the Meet. They can also talk to one another, obviously. 

I teach high school, so it hasn't been too much of a pain. I have many more kids remote than face-to-face."
highschoolteachers,"Ah yes, Texas. Where high school coaches are paid $130,000+"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Your first few years are extremely busy and dedicated. Once you find a rhythm, it is vital that you find your work/life balance and learn when to say ""no"" or you will burn out by year five.

Sometimes you can't find a rhythm no matter how hard you try because once you do they switch stuff up on you. This is particularly true for high school I think. If you teach multiple subjects they can move you around from department to department or have you teaching 5+ preps (subjects) in a year and you never really get to keep your rhythm. Sure, you'll be experienced enough that it won't always be like your first year...but you won't be able to properly balance."
highschoolteachers,"From what I learned back in stats class, “numbers don’t lie, until you use it for your own agenda.” 

In my state, we are still seeing thousands of cases per day although it’s not as huge as last year. However, we’re talking about unvaccinated children here. Yes, they’re young and they’ll most likely survive this, but again, their immune systems are still developing, just like their brains. So, if one of them got the virus and parents still insist on getting them back to school, then....back to quarantine period we go. 

It’s so easy for everyone to say, “oh, it’s just only a couple of weeks! They’ll be okay!” It might be okay for those kids, but what about those other teachers they have socialized during that day? Or the poor school staff that was just at the wrong place, wrong time. We have lots of high school teachers that are close to retirement and just waiting for this year to end so that they could retire. It sucks to be so close to retiring only to die from this virus."
highschoolteachers,"Iowa said we couldn’t do junior high school sports ... but high school and college were just fine. 

As if anyone goes to junior high sports in the first place."
highschoolteachers,"I'm new but I love teaching. I like the admin, I like my colleagues. I'm having a lot of fun and am excited about my future. 

I think the key takeaways from this sub are:

\- Don't work at private or charter expecting any kind of worker protection

\- Don't teach in a state that has no/weak unions

I am very happy with my union and their relationship with the superintendent and admin. My work environment is emotionally healthy. Me and my colleagues do not work beyond contracted hours (mayyyybe an extra 30 mins here and there if we need to meet a deadline or need to do something out of the ordinary prep-wise?) 

I am lower elementary. I hear a lot of misery from middle school and high school on here. My husband is a high school EBD teacher and is very happy  with his job and being in this field. He is going on year 11. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Are things perfect? No. I could bitch about a number of things, but that's mostly because I care about my kids and my job and need to vent to process things. 

To be a teacher I think you need to make sure you don't stay in toxic schools and avoid states that have unfriendly labor laws which seek to exploit your labor and devalue your expertise."
highschoolteachers,"I remember when I was in high school, I brought my teacher a scary note that another kid had written to me. Basically admitted that he was stalking me, and he was feeling suicidal. I trusted the teacher to help me, handed it to him after class. He read it and whispered, “holy fucking shit” and escorted me straight to the principals office. Got his class covered and was kind of my advocate because he (rightly) predicted that the assistant principal would blow me off. When I heard my teacher say the f-word, I knew I wasn’t crazy for thinking how serious the situation was."
highschoolteachers,"This right here. If we were to spend the same amount of money on every extra curricular opportunity for students and they still chose sports good for them, that’s their choice. But that’s definitely not the case as we all know. We glorify sports in so many ways in and out of school. Nothing wrong with sports themselves but the emphasis and importance of sports has eclipse pretty much every other facet of school. Ignoring the actual legal obligations, if sports is the only reason you do school, how did you make it to middle school/high school? It’s the images you see in media that perpetuate sports being the fantasy life that you can achieve through hard work, when in reality it’s an extremely small portion of even the most talented players that get called for that."
highschoolteachers,"Let's say you're looking at Chicago Public Schools. CPS is located in a city where wealth is very, very segmented on race. The 30% of the city that is white is for the most part, exceedingly wealthy compared to the city as a whole (on average, they make 2.5x the median household income for the city). Meanwhile, about 60% of the city is made of predominately poor blacks and Hispanics. Now let's say that a magnet high school, such as Lane Tech College Prep High School, the number one rated school in the entire state of Illinois according to ISBE, has a 6/10 rating on Great Schools (https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1221-Lane-Technical-High-School/). Now, we're not saying the test is biased, but the data analysis definitely is. Somehow, by taking in more students that start at a lower level compared to the wealthier students, because those students are segmented on race instead of on wealth (like what happens in NYC due to its smaller income disparity between racial groups in the city), the school gets rated as mediocre instead of as a 10/10 school.

Essentially, the tests aren't necessarily biased but the data analysis being done by a third party (in this case, GreatSchools) most definitely is biased against greater diversity within a school."
highschoolteachers,"Here is the best high school in the entire state of Illinois according ISBE: https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1221-Lane-Technical-High-School/

It's rated 6/10. Why? Because they have a minimum threshold of low income students that they accept every year. The ratings literally make no sense and the data they have on it even seems wrong. This is one of the schools that parents in Lincoln Park (overwhelming wealthy and white) will stay in the city to try to get their kids into because there is literally no other school as good as it in the entire state. Many parents that I know through work left the city when their kids lost the lottery to get into it. Yet Great Schools thinks it's mediocre at best.

The ratings just make no sense."
highschoolteachers,"Depends what country (and state, if US) you're in. I spent 7 years in the classroom in FL. Statistically, most teachers leave the profession after 5. 

Teaching is a very rewarding job, but it also pays like shit, and America as a whole generally expects teachers to willingly act the role of martyr. It's why burnout is so common. I burned out by the age of 28. Luckily, early in my career, another veteran teacher gave me the best advice I've ever received: 

""When it's not fun anymore, don't feel guilty about leaving.  You'll feel this coming, so have an exit strategy! Otherwise, you'll be stuck in this career and be too burned out to find a new one"".

I'm glad I spent time as a teacher, and I'll definitely go back to teaching at some point in the future, once I'm retired. But I'm glad I left. I see a stark difference between my friends and former colleagues that left the profession, versus those that stayed. It's hard being a punching bag for administration, parents, and (some) students year after year for shit pay. 

My advice? If you become a teacher, have an exit strategy. Go into it knowing that statistically, you won't be doing this forever. Around year 5, when the burnout started to set it, I began teaching myself to code. Eventually, I made the jump to coding. I now teach Machjne Learning trainings.  My time is valued, and the pay is *much* better. I still get my teaching fix, and I help coach at a local high school on the side to still get the impact ""high"" that I got from helping students as a teacher. 

Teaching is great, and I'm glad I did it, but I'm more glad that I left before it made me depressed and bitter. I can afford to buy a house and have a family now, and the skills that I picked up as a teacher make me stand out among my peers in my new career."
highschoolteachers,"10000% 

All women are “qualifiers” for the most part meaning their gpa and their sat scores qualify them for a D1 scholarship. 

The men did horrific on the SAT and obviously their high school grades weren’t accurate because they couldn’t spell, write or read very well. It was the same with our football team. My college boyfriend could barely string a few good sentences together when he was writing. It was actually pretty sad."
highschoolteachers,"I just looked up my old high school. 1,500 students. Mostly blue collar with a large dose of white collar kids (due to the seat of a Fortune 500 company and a HUGE hospital), and ""diverse."" 8/10. 


I'm wondering if The Data is just ... bad in general. I mean, I know it is. Those tests prove nothing. They're not a measure of anything. I suppose the only thing Greatschools can tell us is this: Very high test scores are a proxy for a school with good discipline and a good culture. And that's about it."
highschoolteachers,"Not on purpose. I have, in years long past, lost my cool and the colorful language was out of my mouth before I could stop it, but I'm much more composed now than I was back then as a newbie. 

I tell my students now that I *do* cuss outside of school and they can't believe it. I don't seem like the cussing kind when I'm in teacher mode, but I can actually out-cuss a fuckin' sailor. 

I teach high school, so I do try to lead by example. I don't want to hear it so I'm not going to use it. It's just inappropriate in the school setting, IMO."
highschoolteachers,"Nope. Even once I get my roster, I don’t go and ask about the students. I teach high school, and on more than one occasion, I’ve had a student who was fantastic for me but had a terrible reputation with previous teachers. I will check their historical grades a week or two into the term, but I like to wait till I’ve formed an opinion on them. I tell my kids that I work under a willing delusion that they are all well-behaved both inside and outside of school, and that I will continue to believe that so long as they don’t do anything to break that illusion for me."
highschoolteachers,"Stop being a creep on Reddit. According to your post history you are also a high school student, and in nursing school."
highschoolteachers,"I also teach high school seniors, definitely agree."
highschoolteachers,"When I was a freshman in high school, we got a brand spankin' new football stadium. Over a million dollars. In my art class, there wasn't enough money for new paint, brushes, etc. It's crazy to me how there's always money for football, but everyone else is left to figure it out.

(disclaimer: I'm not a teacher, I went to school for 3 years for it and decided I didn't want to deal with the stuff yall deal with on a daily basis so yall have all my respect ❤️)"
highschoolteachers,"Age group matters here. In high school, I had a few teachers who cussed in front of us and we read books with swear words in them. It was age appropriate and IMO totally acceptable. I currently teach elementary school and don’t swear in front of my kids."
highschoolteachers,First off I’d never cuss at a kid but I have cussed in front of my current students....but I teach high school in juvie. I teach art and it’s always at the art. I try not to though and when I teach at another school I won’t. My students use the worst language. Plus they appreciate knowing that I even struggle sometimes with my filter. I feel like appearing perfect all the time just makes their efforts seem less worth it. Being an adult is a practice and we aren’t all perfect.  They need to know that some adult behavior is still difficult even though it’s what’s expected of us. I would never glorify their crimes but an occasional damn when I make a mistake on my work may slip out
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I love watching sports, but they influence so much of how schools function,

Well considering public ED has been watered down to the point where you can get to high school without ever writting your name on piece of paper; at this point schools are just food banks, ""free"" babysitting services, athletic development, and occasionally education thrown in."
highschoolteachers,"If there was one double standard I wanted to erase from my high school was the sports worship.

I was a theater kid, but we didn’t get letter jackets, we couldn’t join the National Honor Society without also playing a sport. We brought in profit with a few plays, sports got new turf or equipment every year."
highschoolteachers,"It depends where you are. Im in a title 1 school and sometimes thats the only way to convey how serious you are to your kids. I dont use the F word or any of the ""high tier"" vulgar words ever though, I do consider that unprofessional. 

It also depends on their age. Below a high school level? Never. I teach high school."
highschoolteachers,"Obviously this is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt, but my cousin was her teen grandson’s guardian. She didn’t work. He had terrible attendance. She just never made him go to school. When her son was a kid, she was the same way. He didn’t finish high school. Though when her grandson eventually went back to live with his parents (her eldest daughter and son in law), both of whom worked, his attendance did improve."
highschoolteachers,"Go look up the Sacramento Kings and how that city has done everything they can to prevent them from moving. I don't know your small towns and I'm sorry if all of this happened but for thr most part these towns do give a damn. I am sadden to see sports tear people apart. 

What the fuck? Where is this? This is sickening behavior. I love sports but fhr worse zi got during little league was parents yelling at me to make errors in the field. 

Actually it does because if you didn't do it have fun sitting next game. My coaches didn't play around. It isn't an action as you are require to do it. Even in the pros you are looked down upon for not doing it. I dare you to go to an MMA or boxing gym and challenge someone to a spar and not touch gloves while they are and sucker punching them. You'll be jump within seconds by everyone. That simple gesture does teach you respect dude. Trust me it did for me, my older brother, and cousins. 

Also, the hazing and cruel things is apart of growing up but as someone who has been a victim of it, it an go too far sometimes. I was high school rugby team that taught making rape jokes about me was funny. That got shut down quickly thankfully but that was hurtful. Those same guys started to respect me though for my play and some them are longtime friends. This part here though is more learn behavior and poor parenting than sports. The parent needs to teach their kids right from wrong. 

I think you should watch a playoff hockey game. Go look up anyone. At the end of the series the teams shake hands. 

Yeah I don't like athletes like that. They are doing too much but credit to those who can do it.  The stuff with baseball you bring is due to lack of funding of some areas and how getting a baseball scholarship is hard. That only exist due to the downward trend of popularity for baseball. I get you with this community part. 

Let me ask this. Do you hate sports in general or the people in it?"
highschoolteachers,"What the heck? No way! I remember when I was in school the exact bad words that slipped out of a teachers mouth. The shocked look on their faces! What need is there? I’m trying to teach them how to behave in a somewhat polite society, and their parents would probably kill me. ( I teach high school, but still) One kid threw a fit about the word hell in a poem."
highschoolteachers,"I would cuss on occasion here and there, but it's a lot easier to do with high school seniors. In fact, you usually get a better reaction with them since it's a bit humanizing

Obviously nothing HORRIBLE gets said, but it's important for older students to know that you're a human too"

highschoolteachers,"From a current high school sophomore:

I agree that school sports have problematic elements, and sadly the best players on the teams often get free passes in their classes, but how the hell is getting rid of sports fair to those of us who are good students?

I’m an honors student who pulled a 3.9 last semester, and I’m looking forward to baseball *so much*.

If schools didn’t give exceptions ( I know it’s wishful thinking), would you still feel this way?"
highschoolteachers,"Depends on where you teach and what you love about it. I don't think I'd like to be a high school teacher in the US, but I love being a college teacher in the Netherlands."
highschoolteachers,"I would cover much more in depth content, no more 1 day civil war lesson. I would also only do unit tests, unit vocab quizzes, and maybe 3-4 optional homework’s a semester. This is how ap classes ran when I was in high school, and I think more kids would benefit from content and not busy work. Projects 9/10 times in my experience turn out to be miserable for kids."
highschoolteachers,"I think part of the reason sport was linked to better academic performance was because to play, you had to maintain the grade. 

I know, personally, when I was teaching high school, my football, volleyball and cheerleaders were among my top preforming students. A huge part was because if I said they weren’t doing their homework or being disrespectful, the coaches would first make them finish/ do their homework, turn it in an apologize, extra warm ups and THEN let them practice. I was the cheer coach, so they already knew."
highschoolteachers,"If a student cannot maintain at least a barely passing GPA in high school, they have no business in higher academia. Giving scholarships to students based on how well they handle a child’s ball while low income students with academic promise sit at home because they cannot afford to attend a university, is non-sensical. This is why many employers now require an SAT type exam before hiring a candidate. They know that these colleges and universities have become degree factories. They have flooded the job market with ‘academic’ degrees that have watered down the value of all of our degrees. Hopefully most employers will do the same in the future."
highschoolteachers,"The potential scholarship is great, but then again, how are students going to do well in college if they can’t even do well in high school? Disregarding their high school grades or inflating them puts students at a disadvantage for if they go to the university level and nobody is going to coddle them grade wise."
highschoolteachers,Its not its just your students are held to a lower standard. Please be rigorous. Half of my 9th graders can barely write or read. They are so far below their grade level. Its killing me. Just a desperate plea from a high school teacher.
highschoolteachers,"K but high school has no excuse. I was doing far harder work than my 9th graders are when I was in school and Im only 26. Its sad up here that they cant even cheat on the virtual work bc their so lazy and/or filled with mental and emotional trauma/stress, let alone cheat RIGHT (kids copy and pasting formatted text like complete idiots)"
highschoolteachers,"Currently in a high school severe/profound setting.  I'm on zoom for 2 hours/day, split across 4 students who are 100% virtual.  My admins tell me that IAs don't need to plan lessons, but my virtual group can't do any of the work that's posted (like, giving the kids that use AAC phonics lessons, or bar graphs to the ones that don't know their numbers).  So yes, I plan my own lessons and I design them around each of their interests and IEP goals, on which I take regular data.  When I'm not on zoom, I'm with the in-person students in their inclusion classes.  Mostly behavior monitoring.  At the end of the day I walk groups of students to their busses.  My room teacher is awesome and kept me off of lunch duties bc I have immunocompromised family members.  My admins don't seem happy with me, but fuck it.  I'm not going to sit and play youtube for these kids all day."
highschoolteachers,"I'd be shocked if online is going to be offered as an option 2 weeks from now here. We already had 3 days this week where internet was down district wide so no one from home could log in and no one from any campus could use internet- it disrupted our state testing on days when online students had to report to campus to take the tests. No official announcements yet but parents are being told that they need a doctor's note for their kid or they'll have to come back in person for 4th quarter. Since 4th quarter is almost entirely spent on taking standardized tests (our testing season at high school level is usually about 10 weeks), I guess it would be for making sure as many students as possible take the tests."
highschoolteachers,That sounds really lucky if you're a high school. Every school around here has had 50-100 cases by now since we opened in person for all students who chose to come in August. It's still nothing to where we would consider closing but one case in three months sounds hard to imagine. We get a few every week at my school and just send the students who sit within 6 feet of the positive case home for a week.
highschoolteachers,"So you are saying the 0% isn't representative, but replacing it with a 50% would be?  Or is that just mathematically more palatable because it allows more students to pass without doing the assignments.  Or given that they know SOMETHING, am I supposed to use my limited in person interactions to guess what I think they would have gotten on the assignment?

I read through the article.  I agree with many of its ideas, but as with much of educational research, it seems somewhat divorced from the realities of our jobs.  In particular it seems to treat the idea of effort or attendance as wholly separate from content understanding.  Now I don't actively include these behaviors in the grade, but their correlation to learning is so tight I don't need to.  I teach high school science.  No one is born as a natural science prodigy; if you want to know DNA structure or the rock cycle, you have to try to learn it. Kids who do the practice assignments do well on summative assignments, kids who don't tend to do poorly.  As such I don't have an issue giving 0's for missing work because 

A) I accept all missing work, so they're not permanent

B) They help motivate students to do the work.

For what it's worth, I've worked at a distract that graded on a 1-4 scale, no 0's allowed.  After a few years they added the 0 as an option for missing work, as too many kids saw the automatic one as good enough and didn't bother to do it."
highschoolteachers,"I used to be a para in a mod- severe high school sped room. I assisted students with work, meeting IEP goals, supervising them and providing support when they went to their few mainstreamed classes. Along with little tasks like running errands (picking up paperwork, making copies, stuff like that)."
highschoolteachers,"This is the year that I quit sports cold turkey. Not any one reason. Competitive sports make me anxious when I'm invested in the outcome. Also, I fully believe that high school sports are one of the main reasons we've been in person since August.

But, really, the main reason is that I'm still working to be a good citizen and avoid as many gatherings as ai can (besides, you know, my 6 hours a day trapped in a poorly ventilated room with teenagers)."
highschoolteachers,"Definitely in the same boat. It urks me to no end that our high school is called an Early College High School and we can't even pretend to instill the accountability that is gonna be required at that level. I feel for you for being in that situation, but stick to your guns kids need to learn the sad reality that bad stuff doesn't mean you get to shit all over your responsibility"
highschoolteachers,"My high school seniors don’t handle change.  

So for the last quarter, we are bringing them in hybrid.  Somebody needs to explain to me why."
highschoolteachers,"I think cheating now is different than it was before. I'm 25 years out of high school, but at the time the kids who cheated were doing it to pass a class and just graduate.  The top kids generally didn't feel that they had to cheat to do well.

Now, some of the most frequent cheaters are the ones who are identified as the best students.  They cheat because they want the best possible grades they can get and they feel the pressure of never turning in work late or not knowing an answer/having to guess at something.  The struggling kids?  They just don't even bother to do the work at all because either they'll pass anyway, or they'll do credit recovery online (which in itself is a total joke) and they'll still graduate.

What kills me about the cheaters is that they will try to look up answers for personal, opinion based questions or answers that ask them to analyze unique data.  It just boggles my mind that they can't recognize that there are situations in which any answer may be the ""correct"" one; or that if they are collecting and analyzing data in a science class, they might not (should not!) have the exact same data as another group."
highschoolteachers,"I had a parent about a month ago force a Zoom meeting with every single one of the student's teachers present in the same meeting (high school) and the district office present, which is clearly a HUGE pain in the neck to schedule. The reason for the meeting is that the parent *claimed* that all teacher communication had been unacceptable and that was the reason for all the student's variety of issues.

To start the meeting, I carefully asked if she was having trouble accessing Google Classroom, the online gradebook, the parent email system, or any other automatic parent access that we have available, since I (and everyone) could see that she hadn't even accepted the *automatic* parent invite that all of these systems sent out back in August. 

I also carefully asked if we all had the right email address, since I use an email tracker and I could see that the various emails I had sent out had never been opened (I already knew we absolutely had the right address, but this was a much better tactic, to ""assume"" a technology issue.).

Also, I snuck in a compliment for her attentive and witty student and their solid grades (at the time).

The meeting only lasted another 5 minutes before the sibling (who was slightly offscreen) grabbed the parent's phone, signed her up, and handed it back. The parent then rambled for a bit, and the totally solid district representative just rolled on through the precedent I had set.

I got a private thank you from the SPED teacher who had been saying the *same thing* that I had asked for the *entire* school year to no success.  (I claim *no* credit for the tactic, I just put heron the spot for the message that had bounced off her already from the great SPED teacher who was at his wits end.)

The one great thing about DL, everything has evidence, from emails to Zoom attendance and recordings.

tl;dr Get an email tracker. It is *awesome* tool for evidence for parent (and admin) meetings / interactions."
highschoolteachers,I’m sorry. It really sucks with apathetic students. What grade do you teach? Sounds like high school
highschoolteachers,Interesting. I always take late work and our grades don’t matter. Students are very aware that straight Fs still goes to high school. I teach in an urban middle school.
highschoolteachers,"LOVE Nearpod! Even my high school kids love the Time to Climb game for vocab review - it's goofy enough that its not too ""cringy"" for them to play. 

My dept decided to avoid EdPuzzle and use the video options on ActivelyLearn so they don't have extra websites to deal with. Love AL.com and Nearpod even when we are in school, but they've been excellent during virtual!"
highschoolteachers,"The kids at my school have a Discord server where the the students share past assignments with each other. Some of them FORGET TO CHANGE THE NAME ON THE ASSIGNMENT. 

I am a millennial high school teacher with Gen Z kids. They are absolutely atrocious with tech. I don’t know what happened with the freshman this year, but they do not have any basic computer skills (I teach at a $42,000/ year private school so it’s not an equity issue). I have to walk students step by step to DOWNLOAD A FILE TO THEIR COMPUTER AND SAVE SOMEWHERE THEY CAN FIND IT. I have several kids who are not able to type with both hands. I have a few theories for why my 9th graders do not have basic computer skills.

1.	 Yeah, these guys were born in the digital age, but they were born when user interface has become incredibly simple. If there isn’t an icon or a big red arrow telling them what they are supposed to do next, they don’t have the skills to figure it out.
2.	I am just gonna flat out say it, my ninth graders are helpless. They are not use to problem solving on their own, or Googling the solution to a problem. I’ve spent this year modeling it for them. I am teaching them how to write a research paper, and if they can’t find what they are looking for in the top 2 results they give up and say it’s not possible. 
3.	Older district leaders and administrators are overestimating the tech skills that GenZ have since they are, “digital natives.” They need basic computer literacy and typing classes."
highschoolteachers,"Im super up front with my students about this, I probably have a higher failure rate in some of my classes compared to other teachers. But im very up front with our school admin about the fact that my classes are all electives so let them learn now that I don't care about them doing their work unless they come to me for help with it. They support me as long as I often remind the students that this is how they will be treated post high school. 

I also just don't really care, do your shit or fail. Im not holding their hands."
highschoolteachers,I wonder if this is connected to the fact that we now have college set up as the norm for so many people(in the US)? Or the fact that we just pass everyone from one grade to the next in high school?
highschoolteachers,"I defo understand the lack of enthusiasm and how it can be soul crushing and draining. I basically made it my goal this year to see what (if anything) I can do to increase engagement.

While its definitely tempting to just give up and wait for in person school, I think there's some things worth trying that have worked well for me.

(Disclaimer: I teach high school seniors at a title 1 school so they are high on the disengaged meter but every teachers situation is different.)

Cameras &amp; unmuting. I get why they don't want to do it. While my school technically **requires** it, enforcement is impossible. Especially when some students can't turn them on without it killing their internet. What I have tried is telling my students how I feel. Like that when I feel like I'm talking to a blank wall it drives me crazy and makes me feel like my work is meaningless. I tell them that this isn't their fault but it's how I feel and that I need some people to have their cameras on for my sanity. This didn't get everyone to turn them on (obviously) but it did help. 

I also give a (tiny) bit of EC for students who volunteer to unmute and who have their cameras on so that has helped as well. It's a little more work but I have trusted students help me keep track of it so not too much work.

Student choice and independence. A couple of months ago I read an article about UDL in online courses and I found it to be very helpful. Online it's difficult to keep everyone engaged when the activity is passive. So while I'm talking, my assumption is that they are on their phone half listening. I try as often as possible to make all activities projects etc to be their responsibility to complete on their own. And I try to give as many options for how to engage with it/complete it as possible. This approach takes more planning but I have found that spending class time checking in on their progress and giving feedback to feel much more enriching of an experience. It helps me feel like I am actually helping students make progress.

Give yourself a break. It's ok to feel drained, this year sucks! You will make it through and your students will too. It feels bad sometimes but don't give up. There are ways to improve things you just have to keep looking, but don't kill yourself in the process. You can do it!"
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, let's be honest, no one especially likes cleaning toilets, even in their own house. I'm saying this as a 25 year old adult who cleans my toilet on a regular basis, it's my 2 least favorite house chore. I know it's important but no one said I had to like it.

Maybe, op should use his students' dislike of cleaning toilets as a starting point for a conversation about why they should finish high school and continue their education afterwards so they don't have to clean toilets for a living instead of complaining on Reddit. As you mentioned, how many 14-15 year olds have a strong understanding of the job market? I'd presume not many."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I don't think op understands that his students would probably be a lot more willing to clean toilets if it typically paid well, Hell I think most people would. Society is fucked up in the sense that if you work your ass off with a high school diploma at McDonald's you can't go anywhere because you'll never make enough to get ahead. Also, how old are his students 16? Not too many 16 year olds are exactly keen on house chores even if they do them weekly, and the students who are happy to clean toilets to make some money aren't going to tell their teacher, especially in that sort of class.

The sad part about op's post is that he doesn't seem to get most of those students will be likely be stuck cleaning toilets in minimum wage jobs for most of their lives if they drop out.

FWIW, I'm not saying stomach ulcers and having 2 glocks in your Jansport is the best lifestyle but as some who's worked retail while in college I don't blame you too much either. Retail never pays enough to get anywhere in life and often wears you down mentally."
highschoolteachers,"I didn't know that things were so different where you are. I was in sped from fifth grade on but was phased out of everything but the math by high school. College didn't give a damn about sped. I got my bachelor's, got a job, got married and went on to live a normal life. Where i live sped isn't really anything bad you just went to a different room for classes and got extra services like speech and occupational."
highschoolteachers,"Spanish teacher here. Last year, I conducted class in target language 75-90% of the time. I had students creating meaning with the language, working in small groups on extended creative projects, writing and speaking and constantly pushing their own boundaries. We had an actual class culture. There was genuine rapport between me and my students, and between my students and my other students.

This year, I'm teaching my students Spanish in pretty much the way that I learned it when I was in high school back in the early 2000s. It's the way most people learn Spanish - worksheets and verb conjugations and vocabulary quizzes. Except everything's digital, any writing assignment that we do is almost guaranteed to be 80% Google translated, and you know what? I have honestly stopped caring. 

I've been teaching for 10 years. I know that progress in language acquisition is not linear. I know that students don't retain everything that they're taught, and that I will have to continue spiraling content up and down the curriculum. But this year, it's like trying to put out a fire by carrying the water in a sieve.

A student in Spanish 2 asked me the other day, ""what does 'un' mean?"" That's where we're at. I need you to make some kind of effort if I'm going to have any chance of teaching you anything. It's maddening."
highschoolteachers,I have to teach 2 high school general music classes along with my band classes.  I use to try my hardest to make it a fun class where kids got to actually express their opinions about music.  They just stare at my blankly and wait for me to tell them the answers.  Notes it is.  Not worth my prep time that can be used on my main agenda - 6th - 12th band.
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math, so in a good/normal year I still do a lot of “I do, we do, you do” guided notes and throw in some more interactive and engaging stuff/group work when I get the chance. This year it’s just guided notes every day. I’m running myself ragged to keep up with this year, so I’m not doing bells and whistles while most of my kids don’t care anyway. Except for tests/quizzes (I really shouldn’t even call them that because that’s not what they are lol), all my grading is a quick eyeball and full credit as long as it’s more than half done. Grading *still* takes forever because of all the data entry involved across two platforms. 

The mantra of this year has been “pick your battles” when it comes to time management, and pretty much anything other than “I’m not ready for tomorrow yet” is a battle I just won’t pick."
highschoolteachers,"This is really hard for me to answer. I've been in situations in the past where I've stayed after school for hours to help a student who I don't even have for class catch up on her work so she doesn't fail. Or I've sat with a kid and walked him through an assignment step by step so he could just get it turned the fuck in. Or I've pulled regular ed kids who needed extra help along with my special ed kids (as a para). I don't regret doing any of those things, because some of those kids were willing to work their asses off and were just dealt a shit hand. But I've learned to be really cautious about stuff like this, because kids get really dependent and helpless on their own, and you aren't always going to be there. Obviously you know your kids and their situation much better than I possibly ever could, but I'd be really careful if they're totally unwilling to put forth effort of their own. 

On the flip side, there SHOULD be more options for kids like that who just need real world skills and if you can give them that you should. But don't give so much that you're running yourself ragged over someone who doesn't give a fuck and isn't willing to meet you halfway. I think their age is a huge factor too....high school kids need to take more responsibility for themselves, while younger kids do need more structure. 

I'm realizing as I'm writing this that I guess I don't have a good answer because it's complicated. Do right by your kids, but don't burn yourself out. "
highschoolteachers,"I have a job I like and am taking a new job next year in my district (tenure isn't by school here, so is unaffected -- as long as it's within the district) because it's the #1 high school in my district, 8 minutes from my house, that I've been wanting to work at for years. They happened to be hiring this year in my department. It's one of only two high schools that wouldn't mean getting up SUPER early to commute (way earlier than middle but do-able) and I REALLY want to work in high school without getting up at 4am. I did my time in middle school, really liked the current school I was at, but absolutely did not hesitate to apply. 

There are lots of reasons you'd look to change jobs. The best jobs usually require taking other jobs first and waiting and making connections. I told my Principal when I felt it was appropriate (after the interview, when they would call references) but not before applying. 

I like my Principal and she's not vindictive. But I think everything up to the interview going well is just a personal matter. "
highschoolteachers,Hopefully others will add on with some Florida-specific details. A lot of what you're asking is very specific to the building or district. I've often said I expect kids to be kids...so I didn't see a huge difference between high school and elementary--it's just a different range of behaviors/knowledge but similar strategies. I've learned to protect my summers and use that as time to catch up on a lot of my side interests. The time is there if you learn to step away from the job. In the districts I have been in AP jobs tend to be more coveted--but that is district specific and you may find job postings that are assignment specific.
highschoolteachers,"I maybe read the original post wrong but I thought it was year 9, like a freshman in high school... "
highschoolteachers,"Second on the pizza party if you only have one classroom that you teach. If you are a high school or middle school teacher with 140+ students, just stand in front of class and tell them what you told us (the edited but emotionally honest version). They will appreciate the authenticity."
highschoolteachers,"I do not pass students who do not pass.  Students only pass my ELD class when they have mastered that level of English.  If I pass them and they are not ready for benchmark level English, then I am doing them a disservice.  They get all sorts of services when labeled as an English learner, and their other teachers are more supportive of their language needs when they are in the early to intermediate stages of language growth.  Likewise, if I fail a student that clearly understands the language and just performs poorly, I am holding that child back.  Anyone with a D- or above passes (grade stands, but they promote to the next level).  

That said, I encourage my fellow middle school teachers to give credit/no credit to our recently arrived English language learners.  They don't have the language skills to earn the grades, but they do put in a good effort.  We promote students on to the next grade level despite passing or failing grades (it is rare to retain).  At the high school level they must fail like every other student and retake as their English improves.  "
highschoolteachers,"I usually fail them. Right now, though, I have one kid I will give a break. He's done fuck all, but part of the problem is he's never developed good academic habits. I made a deal with him that instead of reading To Kill a Mockingbird with the rest of the class, he will read a book of his choosing that meets my standards. If he completes the assignments I provide, I will pass him.

He is on track to fail out of high school if he doesn't go to continuation school next year. My pity D- is not going to give him an unfair advantage in life. In his case, I care more about helping him developing good habits than academic justice."
highschoolteachers,"There is a lot of pressure on urban schools not to suspend or expel students. I think some students at my high school got expelled for beating another student to the point where he was bleeding, had broken bones, and had to go to the hospital. 

Up to the point where the school risks financial liability, all students can be taught, and only bad teachers want to remove students from the classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I feel your pain! I teach high school and am ready to beat my head on my desk. We have 8 school days left (not including exams). I'm trying to not count down/get excited but I can TASTE summer. 

Hang in there, everyone!"
highschoolteachers,I came in here thinking you meant Early Childhood Education. Whoopsies. *slowly backs out of high school science thread*
highschoolteachers,"I remember saying this with my peers in high school and college. I would have never said this to my educators though. The one teacher and three professors who I've said this about came with other reasons for why I wasn't willing to have them teach me (they had said things in the past negatively about another culture and had ""jokingly"" made a claim while teaching that rubbed me the wrong way). "
highschoolteachers,"Wouldn't weight classes in boxing and other combat sports help to resolve this? Also, when kids are younger we have them in gender mixed gym classes in my area, and then at the end of high school - the only time they are segregated in a gym class would be grade nine when everyone is required to take it. In order to be on a highly competitive team you'd have to try out, and if you were not able to meet the standards required by that team for your gender you wouldn't be on the team and thus wouldn't be playing the sport. Not sure I see your argument. "
highschoolteachers,"I think it is important to clarify that mathematics is NOT a race.  If they are taking Algebra 1 in 8th, Geometry in 9th, Algebra II in 10th,  Pre-calc in 11th, and Calculus in 12th, they are STILL ahead of most high school seniors who graduate college ready with pre-calculus.  I tell my students it is much better to excel and get the foundations in middle school and in algebra, as it sets them up for getting A's in mathematics and doing well in Calculus BC.  A college would rather take an A mathematics student in Calc BC over an average student who took Calc AB and Calc II.  They don't really see a difference in Calc I and Calc II...they are looking if you will be successful in college math courses (which most likely result in retaking Calc II at anyrate).  They are on target to be ahead of the curve already...focus on a strong foundation and getting to Calc BC...paints a better picture in the long run.


Also, do students have cogat scores?  The cognitive score seems to be a VERY good predictor on advance placements in mathematics from my experience."
highschoolteachers,"I think the worry is that the students who don't skip will think that they are ""bad at math"" and that this attitude will be self-fulfilling. I'd combat that by addressing it directly. Not skipping means taking your time to learn things more thoroughly, there's plenty of time to learn all of high school math, and you can always improve with practice.

Unfortunately, our society has such an obsession with ""prodigies"" that this will be an uphill battle."
highschoolteachers,I wouldn't suggest buying it unless you plan on teaching high school but WAGES is a great book full of lessons 
highschoolteachers,"I taught 7th, and I had one section of Algebra and three or four of prealgebra, and there was no placement test which would have made things easier. The counselor went on grades, teacher recommendation, and state test scores to get 30 kids in the class. Some years kid number 30 was a B student with almost average test scores, and the next year kid number 30 was an A student with high scores, because I was getting thirty students in the class no matter what.

Because we didn't have a test with a cut score, kids and parents could get really upset. I would tell them that I'd never had a college call for seventh grade scores, and that if their child did well in math, he or she could double up in high school and take trig and calc senior year and be where the kids who were in algebra in 7th grade were."
highschoolteachers,"I'm personally not worried about trans students, but I am concerned about immature junior high and high school students who use this as an opportunity to use the opposite bathroom for the wrong reasons. The law says that school officials cannot question students who use the restroom of the opposite gender or require a doctor's note. I can already think of a few students who will try to use this law as a reason to use the opposite restroom. It also promotes students to use the locker room that they're comfortable with. Again, locker rooms are open spaces with little privacy. I don't think this is helping keep trans or non-trans students safe. Our school cannot afford to build extra unisex bathrooms or locker rooms. We cannot afford to hire locker room/ bathroom monitors and our schedules don't allow us to monitor these areas. We also can't afford a lawsuit because a student, who isn't trans, decides to use a locker room that's been assigned to the opposite gender for the wrong reasons. And staff cannot question or put a stop to it. I'm not opposed to unisex bathrooms or locker rooms, but this is going to put my school in a huge financial bind unless government officials are willing to fork out the cash to build them. We're a tiny school in a low income community. This could break our district of a trans student were to move into our area or if a dumb kid makes a bad decision. "
highschoolteachers,"You care way more about moving your B- to a B than anyone else in the entire universe. Stay on top of academics, but nobody has ever asked me about my GPA, and unless you are applying to some elite out of state school, nobody cares about your high school GPA either.

My students this year are master point grubbers..."
highschoolteachers,"If that's your experience where you live, ok, but don't pretend every high school age kid nationwide is saying nasty things and posting garbage on Twitter.  Please. "
highschoolteachers,"On Friday I was subbing in an ELL history class. I can understand how it was hard for some students to understand instructions, with the language barrier and all.

But there was one student who I checked in with every 3-5 minutes during the class and when he asked ""What do I do?"" I said ""Write this person's name here. Write the year this picture happened in here.  Do you understand?""  Consistently I would come back and his google doc would look exactly the same.  Until the last time, when he had named the person and begun his historical dialogue ""i pooped"".  The kid is a junior in high school."
highschoolteachers,"You're over simplifying high school aged kids.

They know they're being jerks.  That won't necessarily stop them."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; No school wants to pay for some idiot to get a free education if they are going to jeopardize the team or school's integrity.

lol that's cute.


But on a serious note, if I was in high school and some teacher tried what you suggest, they'd just get laughed at.  Your post and the one above yours both assume that these kids will respond with remorse whenever they're ugliness is dragged out into the light.

I'd suggest looking at youtube comments as a reference . People haven't gotten any less shitty on there now that their real names are associated with their accounts.  "
highschoolteachers,"OP makes some great points and I really agree. However, as a teacher AND a former college athlete part of me wants to stick it to them harder. Calling them out by being adult and professional about the matter will stun them on the spot, but I also feel like they will respond with the appropriate amount of remorse to your face but then go right back to tweeting about it as soon as they leave the room. And you could check this because I doubt they'll make their accounts private because then those who don't follow them can't see their tweets. And since high school kids are soooo witty and hilarious, everyone obviously needs to see these tweets (am I laying the sarcasm on thick enough here?)

Anyhow, in college athletics most schools have someone or multiple someone's to prowl social media sites of their student athletes. No school wants to pay for some idiot to get a free education if they are going to jeopardize the team or school's integrity. Now not all of your students are pursuing an athletic scholarship but many may be applying for other scholarships and later on all will be applying for jobs. People who are about to fork over cash for your education and/or future employers WILL go through their social media accounts. They WILL find things. They will NOT waste their time on people who do not know how to post appropriately. Today they might be posting about their teacher, tomorrow their boss, and then they're out of a job. 

I say make this a bigger, perhaps harder, life lesson. Screen shot those tweets. Put them up on the board. Heck put them on a worksheet. (I'm envisioning the scene in Mean Girls where they make copies of all of the pages in the ""Burn Book"" and distribute them throughout the school... OK maybe don't go THAT far.) I have a feeling their skin will crawl to see their words posted on a big screen. Let them see how others truly do react. We post things online thinking we know how it will be perceived, but to watch someone live digesting your written word is different than sitting at home posting from the privacy of your own house. I say still approach the situation as OP suggested with, ""So I was watching the highlight reel, but it lead me to this,"" etc. If they (or parents) want to complain, guess what, it was on a PUBLIC account! Anyone could have read their words! And anyone JUST did (you). They will likely get mad because it's not the ""anyone"" they wanted it to be, but better to learn now then when the consequences are bigger. 

Sorry you are going through this. For what it's worth, know that there are kids out there that appreciate your efforts. I appreciate your efforts. I remember the struggle. I would bring this up with your cooperating teacher and ask them on their input as well. At the very least give them a heads up that you plan to address it no matter if it is in private or the more public route I'm suggesting. No matter what, do NOT open the floor up to a roast of yourself. You may think they could handle it in good fun, but on the very real chance that they take it too far, there isn't anything you can do about it and you really REALLY will lose credibility. "
highschoolteachers,"In the future, do not stalk their social media profiles. Just don't do it. Nothing good is going to come of it, and it's a little weird. I know their stuff isn't set to private (or isn't as private as it could be), but what would you think of a teacher who was browsing through your social media stuff when you were a high school kid?

Now, do you really want this to be a teachable moment, or do you just want to do something because your feelings were hurt? If it's the latter, you need to remember that they are just kids. You are going to have kids dislike you for the rest of your career. If you aren't doing anything wrong, then don't let it bother you. We don't all have to like everyone we come in contact with (although we should be civil, which I'll address in a minute). Do not ever give a knee-jerk response to getting your feelings hurt in this career. Do not try to embarrass them or get them punished because you can't take the heat. It's usually best to either laugh it off (if it's not super serious) or talk to them one-on one. Asking ""Why would you say that? That was really mean,"" is a good way to start a conversation. Now, if they've done something super disrespectful or libelous/slanderous, then you may need to write a referral, call parents, or even get a lawyer to send them a cease and desist order, but no matter what you are responding to, do so with two things in mind: 1) they are still not adults, and their shit behaviors should be viewed in that light; 2) your job is to help them grow and learn as students and as people; you will accomplish this far better if you can avoid getting antagonistic with them. You want to help them understand and correct what they are doing wrong -- you don't want to just be punitive.

Now, if you want to make this a teachable moment, fine, but you don't know which 40 students voted on the poll anyway, so you'll only be able to speak with the one who started the poll. /u/teacher123yyc  has some good advice for that."
highschoolteachers,"Be careful with this. Even in late high school not all of your students are going to be developmentally capable of understanding sarcasm yet. Even the ones who do understand that you are being sarcastic will also understand that you are being condescending, and how does that serve the needs of anyone in the classroom other than you and your pride and spite? Teachers who did the kind of thing you are describing made me feel uncomfortable in class, made me feel like their room was a hostile environment, and made me too scared to ask questions when I legitimately needed help. Teachers like you made me hate math.

I get where the coming from. I'm a teacher too (10th grade ELA), and my kids also ask questions about things I just explained. I know it is frustrating.  I also know that it is going to happen because no kid is going to be able to stay on task 100% of the time. *Even most adults can't do that.* You have to be in control of your own emotions enough to serve the needs of your kids instead of bullying them when they realize that they spaced out for a minute, missed something important, and try to rectify the situation by asking for your help. Be the adult in the room.

Edit: This seems a little harsh on rereading it, but it is indicative of the strong negative childhood memories I have that are associated with this kind of behavior. The danger of alienating your kids and scaring them away from STEM is real. I truly think that you are hurting more than you are helping. 
"
highschoolteachers,"&gt; conference with them after school and contact a parent. 

Apologies if this begins to border on ranting.

The school I teach in is in an urbanizing town, suburb of a larger city.  The way you suggest utilizing discipline tactics simply doesn't work in my high school.

First, the student would skip the after school session.  They see the classroom teacher as holding no power over that.  The parent would also be next to impossible to contact.  Either the phone rings and no one ever answers, or it's a disconnected number, or maybe you do leave a voicemail and never hear back.  I rarely get someone who actually picks up the phone when they see the school's number.

Now that the student has skipped my session, they get a discipline referral.  Now the housemaster (assistant principal assigned to that grade) will assign discipline, first step is usually a detention.  They will likely skip this if they skipped mine.  After that, they are assigned Saturday school (8-12 on Saturday).  Most students skip this because the next level is indoor suspension.  This is where many of the students will serve their punishment.  It has also taken a week or more to assign this discipline, so now it is removed from the original behavior that caused these consequences.  The message has been lost.

When all this happens repeated attempts are made to try to contact the parents.  The majority of the time, this leads to nothing as the parent will not respond.  It then cycles as the behavior does not change.

I was recently talking to the senior housemaster, and he was talking about how he's been trying to contact a student's family about graduation (and the possibility that this young man wouldn't make it), and was finally able to catch the mom when she came in to dismiss the student.  He had an impromptu conference, the first time he had been able to talk to this parent in two years since he entered the district.

It's a challenge.

Edit:  This is not the way it works for most of the school.  I feel I gave that impression.  This is just how it works for many of the students I teach, as I have the most remedial (non-SLIFE) math class in the building.  There are also a few 9th graders each year where this is the case, but by no means a majority.  This is just where many of the long-lasting behavioral issues are."
highschoolteachers,"If they're suspected of having illegal and/or prohibited things in their bag they can be searched.

Also consider kids getting searched going into dorms, not that different from high school kids getting searched on a school trip!"
highschoolteachers,"For clarity, here is why I mentioned attempted rape:

&gt; I don't trust students just because they're 18 year old seniors. They're still students, and they are not above attempting to pull shit over their chaperones.

It was an example of why I do not trust high school seniors, not why I should search their bags."
highschoolteachers,"Have you ever been a chaperone on a high school field trip?

Parents are paranoid and want us to keep a leash on their kids. They know the stupid shit they do."
highschoolteachers,High school officials are allowed to search bags of high school seniors. College officials are not allowed to search bags of college students (as far as I know).
highschoolteachers,"I think we're the same person. 

I had a horrific student teaching experience and ended up failing my second semester on a technicality. My CT was awful; all criticism, no praise, undermining me and my lessons, talking bad about me to other teachers...just awful. She was actively seeking ways to fail me. Anyway, since my failure was a technicality and not some giant issue of professional conduct or inappropriate behavior, I was able to repeat that semester of student teaching. 

Except I couldn't. I felt the same way as you. ""Who the hell wants to be a teacher?"" I thought. ""Why on earth am I continuing to put myself through this torture? This is insane. I don't want to do this."" It took me *18 months* to feel okay enough with the idea of teaching to go back and finish my credential. I did a lot of stuff in the meantime; I nannied a ton of the time, I was editor in chief of my college paper (where I was able to work my ass off and forget about the horrors of student teaching), I took up a few new hobbies, etc. They all helped. 

When I went back to complete my credential, I got a really beautiful placement with good kids and supportive CTs. Nothing went wrong. I was happy. But I still didn't want to be a teacher. 

I started teaching because my student loans came due and I needed a job, and lo and behold, it was what I was trained to do. There are plenty of people who think teaching requires infinite amounts of dedication and martyrdom, but I'm not one of them. I enjoy my high schoolers; they make me laugh, and we can have good conversations about good books, which is why I got my BA in English and why I went to credential school in the first place. 

But teaching is just a job. It's work. You have a task to perform, and you come to work to do it, and then you come back the next day to keep chipping away at the task until it's as good as you can make it. It's only a vehicle for martyrdom if you let it be. 

The point of my big, rambling story is to take some time and figure out where teaching fits in your life. For me, it is a job I mostly enjoy, but it's not my entire life. For you, it may not fit into your life at all, and that's okay. Don't feel pressured into jumping into the teaching train right away. You owe yourself that time to figure it out for yourself. 

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I don't know how middle school and high school teachers do it! At least my kids are cute and don't know any better. They still have a desire to learn and at least a small fear of punishment. They hit 4th grade, and they know it all. "
highschoolteachers,"When I went to France in high school we got a permission slip for drinking.  It restricted it to two drinks per meal with the chaperone present, but my parents signed it. "
highschoolteachers,"You set your expectations, so then how do you expect to follow through on them. ""Don't bring alcohol or get in each other's rooms!"" And then do.....nothing to insure the expectations are being followed? Just blind faith? That is not how society or high school works."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks. Could you tell me if I received a master's in biology, for instance, would I still have to go through a preparation program to teach middle school or high school biology, chemistry, etc.?"
highschoolteachers,"Yea, treat seniors in high school like children and invade their privacy. Great work!"
highschoolteachers,My high school gave out condoms for free. 
highschoolteachers,"And those laws are where it gets murky. 

I get that they are intended so a 40 year old isn't doing the nasty with a freshman. However..  when I was in high school (ugh, 11 years ago) some guys from the football team who were 18 slept with some girls from their class/ the jr class. The girls' parents found out that their little princesses were doing the deed and demanded answers. Because the boys were over 18 and their daughters were only 16/17 the boys got charged with statutory rape. That shit stayed on their records.  All because of less than a 6 month age difference.

Rules are stupid sometimes. They really need to be more flexible in some cases."
highschoolteachers,"I've been on plenty of overnight trips with students over the years. We have a lot of rules, but ""don't have sex"" isn't one of them. Sure, we tell the kids to stay in their own homosex rooms, but as a homosexual, that certainly wouldn't have prevented me from getting into trouble in high school. But whether or not the kid is having homo sex or non-homo sex doesn't matter—he was being responsible, and that's more than I can say for the average teenage boy. Taking away the condoms will embarrass him and feel like punishment, which is exactly the wrong message to send."
highschoolteachers,"1) I teach high school students in NY. My students range from the children of wealthy international businessmen to unaccompanied minors fleeing violence. 
2) You can probably guess that NY is expensive as hell, but teachers also make pretty decent money compared to most other states. These days NY teachers are required to get a masters within 5 years to maintain their certification. 
3) I love my job. Teaching ESOL (we're calling it English as a New Language these days) is very different from teaching TEFL. TEFL students have English as another subject. They don't really need English to do well in their other subjects, nor survive out in the real world. Learning English in a country where English is the main language is a necessity. This can be motivating or totally isolating. Just a major difference to keep in mind. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm just gonna celebrate for a moment: Friday is field day for my high school, so it's shorts and t-shirt and flip-flops day, plus free food, plus watching the kids have fun together one last time before grad.  My grading is up-to-date (no small feat for an honors English teacher!) (although there is more coming next week), my house is clean, and the weather is supposed to be perfect.  I may just drive to Yosemite for the day tomorrow because I can't think of anything better to do!  Oh end of the year, I'm so happy you've finally arrived."
highschoolteachers,"I teach a core class in high school, and sometimes I put checks on myself, asking ""Now why I am doing this much in just to push Jonnie through the sophomore class? If I help her too much to get her over into the junior class next year, I know that the junior teacher won't do this much for her because she needs to be more independent."" It doesn't help to a student to pass him or her into something that he or she is not actually ready for."
highschoolteachers,"People are assholes. It starts young and doesn't go away in adulthood.

When I was a kid, you were popular if you were good at kickball in elementary school. Uncoordinated? Slow? Fat? Don't like sports? You were doomed until senior year of high school.

Anyhow, some kids like the teachers who let them fool around, don't teach, give the easy A, etc. Some like the teachers who are funny or playful. Some like the teachers who are more physically attractive.

I teach my content. In the beginning of the year, I tend to be more energetic and funny and get more hugs, greetings in the hallway, etc. Eventually, I settle in, am a little more serious, and hold the students to higher expectations, and surprise, surprise the level of enthusiasm from the kids towards me goes down. Then I do a fun activity at the end of the year and all of a sudden they love me again. Then the leave and don't care anymore.

Just try to do what it right, not what is popular. I have achieved success that way even though it can be hard and make you want to hate the rest of the world sometimes."
highschoolteachers,"At that point, I had completely had it with her, so I didn't really care. This is the same teacher who just handed out worksheets every single day and sat at her desk all period, and then complained that I wasn't pushing them enough and that I wasn't quite ready to teach high school. And my university supervisor knew she wasn't a good mentor, but he told me to just wait it out. Thank goodness I had one last internship after that with an amazing teacher! Otherwise, I might have quit teaching before I even started."
highschoolteachers,"Millions of dollars have been poured into all sorts of faddish shit in education over the years for little to no result, or sometimes for a result counter to that which was sought. 

I teach for a period as a co-teacher in an open plan classroom and it's always a cluster fuck of a period. The problem is that we are teaching developing people with, largely, poor impulse control and self regulation and by allowing them out of easy visual confirmation range off task behavior is exacerbated. 

This problem can be solved using 'centers' for differing activities for small groups but that requires: 1. additional planning &amp; pacing 2. constant teacher redirection/intervention and 3. coursework amenable to that style of teaching.

I teach math and history so a lot of what I do is front loaded whole group instruction and the open floor plan model just isn't well suited to that. 

Finally, look at the number of chairs in the first video, and the number of students in the second - the student to teacher ratio is TINY compared to most high schools, making these from the perspective of school boards horribly inefficient in terms of staffing and capital investment. From their perspective if I can teach a class of 35 to 80% competency in a normal sized classroom vs. a class of 20 to 95% competency in an 'open' classroom twice the size then it just makes more sense to have me teach the largest class I can, in the smallest space I can. 

I hope than answers your question. "
highschoolteachers,"I hate the idea that teaching is a calling.

Teaching is a **profession**. Referring to it as a ""calling"" implies teachers exist to sacrifice their personal lives for their profession. Teachers are not martyrs or saints or spirit guides or whatever other romantic nonsense society perpetuates. We're professionals.

That being said, some people are obviously better suited to be teachers than others. Just like I would be a horrible police officer, politician, engineer, or psychologist, many people would be horrible teachers.

For the record, I often thought about becoming a teacher in high school and college, but never felt that calling. I don't consider myself a born teacher. It took a lot of learning. I lucked out liking it, but I wasn't sure until after my student-teaching was done."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school I considered becoming a high school teacher. But I was really timid back then, and to some extent I was frightened about shithead students assaulting me. I blame a movie that I now forget the name of, whose plot involved a riot breaking out in a high school during the 80s (I think). In the movie, several female teachers were raped and basically every high school teacher was assaulted.

I also attended a ghetto high school with some significant (but relatively minor) gang activity, so that influenced my concerns as well.

I've since realized that it is almost unheard of for a student to assault a teacher if you work in a decent school. The closest I've gotten is a student squared up against me and snatched his phone after I refused to give it back. But he's SPED, so even that is an outlier.

Personally, I don't know how SPED teachers do it. With non-SPED kids, we can just suspend their asses for getting physical with anyone. But it seems SPED teachers have to be more patient and put up with more abuse because of the nature of the kids they work with."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a young male high school teacher that is pretty close to my students. They are comfortable enough with me to ask me for life advice and I tend to have a full and rowdy classroom at lunch of students hanging out with each other and being rowdy on levels that I assume other teachers don't tolerate. Having said that, you need to have definitive boundaries with them. They're kids, and should be spending their time with other kids. I would suggest maintaining a positive influence on their lives on campus but nothing outside of campus. No social media, no hanging out off campus, no personal info exchanges. It's good that you have an interest in them and want to be a positive mentor to them, but that shouldn't extend outside of the school environment. Often times our students are rad people, but you have to maintain perspective that they are just kids. They don't know the boundaries yet when they encounter a ""cool"" teacher they can bond with so its your job to know those boundaries and teach them to them."
highschoolteachers,"Depends on the state's certificate requirements. I am from NY and there was a benefit waiting to get a MA because you are technically cheaper, but I have seen the move toward more experience and education over how cheap you may be. But, NY teachers must complete an education program.

Keep the following in mind: you may start at a high school, but your district might shuffle you to the middle school. I was in the high school for 4 years and now I am a middle school teacher. For me, I like teaching everything, but I would hate for you and other teachers to think that you might have a choice in placement (some are given their preference, but you need to keep an open mind).

The job market is hard, so be careful about getting your heart set on a particular level you want to teach. "
highschoolteachers,If we are talking middle school I always go with the oldest biggest kids. But in high school it is the most driven.
highschoolteachers,"12 Angry men is always good. start with teaching them about jury process. how legal system works. set 12 desks up in middle of room and let them pick parts. start to finish reading, 3-4 days. add movie. piece of writing at the end of the unit. 10 days tops.

Kudos to actually introducing the kids to novels and different writers. Here in Wisconsin the only kids getting this kind of exposure in middle school are the private school kids. Public high schools are cutting novels in favor of shitty nonfiction thanks to common core and the new standardized testing in 10th and 11th grades."
highschoolteachers,"The parents like knowing about every little thing about their child, which is both a blessing and a curse. But middle class suburban kids come with a whole host of problems as well, especially at high school. Mental health, hidden experiences of abuse, self-harm, eating disorders, drug/alcohol addictions... They just hide it a whole lot better, so teachers have to be really mindful when kids are starting to act differently to what they're usually like."
highschoolteachers,"A teacher at the high school I'm currently at got a hold of an old shallow file box with a hinged lid. She cut out triangles in the lid to make it look like teeth and painted the box to look like a reptile of some sort. Students either have the option of ""feeding the monster"" as they come in the room, or if they're caught using their phones, the teacher comes over and tells the student that the monster is hungry. Works even with the older students apparently!"
highschoolteachers,"Oh, yeah. You always have great kids in these schools. I'm teaching in a Title I district, but not a Title I school--long story, several elementaries and our only middle school are in the program but not our only high school--and we have a fair amount of high achievers. Those kids on the bottom, though, are a pretty significant proportion, and when you have a lot, they tend to play a hand in influencing the culture of the school as a whole. That's what people are talking about with the Title I stigma. "
highschoolteachers,"in my high school school (it's a charter that's why it works) we confiscate them, put them in a small envelope, write their name on the envelope and give it to a secretary who keeps it until the end of the school day. students who don't give it up get a visit from administration or school officer. students who don't give it up to them get in school suspension. 3 confiscations and students have to turn the phone in upon entering school and get it back at the end of the day for 2-3 weeks. "
highschoolteachers,"One of my old wrestling coaches in high school and his wife were known for inviting other adults into their sex lives. But I only found this out when I saw him and some of my old teachers at a Thanksgiving Day football game when I visited home during college. The faculty knows about it, but the students don't. "
highschoolteachers,"Sometimes, having a Masters and no experience makes you less hireable, because you're more expensive salary-wise but still inexperienced. This depends on the state, though -- certain states require a Masters for high school teachers.

Assuming you're not in a state that requires a Masters, I'd say get a BA in English and get certified on top of that. If you want to teach high school, having a degree in your content area is more important than a degree in education. Many universities have secondary certification programs you can complete simultaneously with your content area degree. If at all possible, choose a program with a student teaching component. I honestly don't know how anyone survives first year teaching without having student taught. Can't emphasize this enough."
highschoolteachers,"I started coaching to restore my sanity after a miserable start to my first year. I did middle school sports for a few years and am making the jump to high school now. My classroom management got much better once I became a coach. It's come in real handy since I teach 6th graders who cannot try out for sports yet. So the boys spend the entire year behaving like angels in my class because they think that I will pick them based on their behavior solely in my class. It will be interesting to see how it changes next year when I am no longer the middle school coach, but a high school coach (many may select to go to a different high school). "
highschoolteachers,"I went to an urban underfunded high school but I work in a suburban school. Some thoughts: it feels much less secure, kids can leave in the middle of the period to go to the restroom and this is considered fine. Most discipline issues are related to either weed, dress code, and maybe one or two disrespectful kids. Most students are there to learn, and are either self motivated or parent motivated. Communication with parents is key, I send out weekly email updates to all my parents. Technology is easier to use since everyone has a smartphone. The emphasis on grades is real, both the parents and kids think they deserve higher grades than they get. If it isn't a 95, some parents will be calling you right away. Be proactive in any classroom behavior issues with parents, don't let the kid be the first to tell mom why they got in trouble. "
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, I allow my students to make use of their phones, so long as they do so in a responsible manner and get their work done at the same time.

That said, in past classes i had a great deal of success in setting up a charging station in the corner of my room and requiring students to check their phones in at the door.

The danger there, of course, is making sure that students don't end up getting their phones stolen. Easy enough to avoid if you just keep a half an eye on them."
highschoolteachers,"Are you talking a reading specialist or just a Title 1 intervention specialist? I have a 6-12 English certification and worked as the latter at the elementary and high school levels. I really think Title 1 just requires you to be a certified teacher in some way. When the elementary school hired me on, they initially hired me to be a lower-el Math Specialist, which had absolutely nothing to do with my certification."
highschoolteachers,"""significance of"" is a question I ask a lot to my high school history students. "
highschoolteachers,"I can see from your posts below that work/grades are standardized and there is a procedure for all curves and test replacements.  Because of the standardized course (which is typical for a TA class or class taught by a lot of different people), this is a perfectly reasonable request.  And, it looks like you didn't follow instruction.  This is unfair to the other sections and classes.  If the rules for grading are so stringent, then get permission before going outside of them.  This can also look like you are trying to alter the appearance of your own performance.

We have standard tests and grade policies across high school classes too.  We don't violate them and discuss changes with our team as it needs to be fair for all students."
highschoolteachers,"Florida is done by county. The district I moved from there had 27 high schools and a truly absurd number of middles and elementaries. It made job hunting easy and if you moved within the county it was easy to transfer to a closer school and our union was fantastic. But district level admin was a giant building of slow-moving paperwork and red tape, and the people making the important decisions were so far removed from the classroom that it wasn't even funny. 

California is completely nuts in how they organize districts but I like the smaller, more local control. I've been here four years and I'm still figuring it out. Pretty much every town has their own, i think? They are all sheltered beneath the county dept of ed, but they are their own district with their own school boards.  But then there are some areas where just one elementary and middle school is its own district with principals at both schools and a superintendent. It's very common for school admin offices and district offices to be the same building. The very rural county I am moving to next year has 32 individual districts within it. "
highschoolteachers,"Cons:  
-The way the standards are lined up with common core do not always make sense...
-We are assessed generally on state standardized tests that we never see (and from what I can tell from sample questions are very poorly worded and incorrect sometimes).  I teach towards the standards, not the test, yet the test is 20% of student grades.  How can I prep them for the unknown.  (This isn't directly common core, more about my state).
-Extremely weak in statistics (our states interpretation often has errors, like trying to teach the difference between theoretical and experimental probability but then nullifying the lesson by making students think that they can just convert experimental to theoretical, using symbols meant for population parameters when they are defining sample variables, etc).
-Constant reorganization and shuffling of standards, makes it hard to get in the groove and effectively plan
-Sometimes jumping from subject to subject allows for students to not achieve mastery of things.  I am sometimes in debate, is early exposure better, or time and mastery?

Pros:
-I like having a universal set of standards across state that make sense of the evolution of mathematics.  I might reorder things personally, but the bonus of having standards across the country is a benefit to students who are transient (of which we have a lot of).  If one of my students moves across the country, they should be able to transition into learning the same things.  That is a bonus.
-Some of the evolution across high school makes so much more sense.  Teachers are able to make stronger connections.
-Teachers are encouraged to use different methodologies that make more sense with context and spatial orientation and methodology that connects to other concepts and curriculum.
-Ability to share strong lessons amongst teachers everywhere
-Encourages problem solving, context based problems, and writing in mathematics.

Question 2:  I can't really give you a full answer on curriculum changes as I'm not the ones making them.  I'm assuming from feedback or looking at standardized testing...they are playing with what works and what doesn't from immediately seems to change.  They've moved the quadratics unit between Algebra and Geometry 3-4 times in the past 5-6 years.  How can I plan and get in a groove if they keep modifying things?  I'm at the point where if I teach three classes, I have to remember what year that student took Algebra...and if a student fails and retakes...it's a mess.  Just for reference, everything in red marked on this curriculum map (a high level review) changed over a year:  https://www.georgiastandards.org/Georgia-Standards/Frameworks/Acc-Algebra-I-Geometry-A-Curriculum-Map.pdf

As you can see, that's a LOT to keep up with for a teacher who is busy in the classroom 8 hours a day.  Luckily, I teach geometry so I was able to pull from that.  But it is very hard to constantly navigate this year from last year from 2 years ago.

Question 3:  Right now I can look at the outcome of students from where then end up going to college and how they perform at our school...it would be hard to track beyond that (but not impossible).  I do understand some merit in standardized testing in knowing where our schools are.  They are poorly written and teachers can't see the content of these tests (even after the fact).  I don't believe in teaching to the test.  I believe in getting my students through the required mathematics courses and being prepared for whatever mathematics courses they will have in careers and college.  The end goal is to make them problem solvers and get them to be able to go on to the next level/position that they choose.  While my school expects me to have a 100% proficient rate (we'll see, I work REALLY hard with students), I have to ask, is that really a measure of success that rates above what they do in my classroom all year and what I observe?"
highschoolteachers,"I teach French and German and am done teaching after this year. I taught college before teaching high school. I miss the college environment.

I love my upper level students, but hate dealing with freshmen. About a quarter of them shouldn't even be in a foreign language class. They have no desire to learn the language, never do the homework, and do poorly on assessments. But because of our district policy, I am required to assist these students on my own time after school. You cannot help people who do not want help.

Things would be so much better if students had to wait until sophomore year to take a foreign language. The counselors in our building use foreign language as a dumping ground for freshmen.

It's okay to throw in the towel and find something else to do. I am. I'm getting back into higher education. Motivated students, no bureaucratic BS. It'll be great."
highschoolteachers,In my town just about every elementary/middle school has it's own district (some are grouped up into groups of 2-4 schools). Then the high schools are all one district for the whole county. 
highschoolteachers,"I live in western MA.  Most towns with 10,000-30,000 residents have their own school districts with 1 high school.  Rural communities have regional districts that include anywhere from 2-8 towns.  Cities have large districts with multiple middle/high schools."
highschoolteachers,"I'm feeling this right now. I currently work middle school but a job change on my husband's part is going to take us across the state...and therefore, allow me to leave my job. Ever since I started applying for high school positions, it's been really hard for me to deal with the middle school behavior and day-to-day general crap (which I feel is almost worst because I teach in a K-8...I feel like we baby them too much). Take a deep breath and remind yourself that you're almost there.  "
highschoolteachers,"As an SPED IA I can tell you that it really depends on the school and classroom. I have worked with High School aged kids for my entire time as an aide, but been in several different programs and classrooms.

I would try and narrow down what age range of kids you want to work with. I really enjoy the high school kids and have some experience with middle school ages, but by far the 14-18 kids are who I want to work with. It took me a long time to find a place where I want to end up and teach. "
highschoolteachers,"go classy and muted, leave the flashy prom dresses to the high school girls."
highschoolteachers,"For my concentration and state (mathematics), it would involve taking 2 certification exams, taking a lot of upper level mathematics courses (30+ credits), math education courses, and it might also require high school student teaching/edTPA (I'd have to look up if previous student teaching qualified).  It would be worth it to get a masters for the 8-12 certification.

Typically high school certificates requires a lot of upper level courses in subject area, educational curriculum, assessment, and pedagogy.  "
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school, I started a club and it quickly became a large club on campus. I did the same in college and by the second year, the club was the largest and most successful club on campus. Basically, I have experience with this.

Create structure to your club in 3 ways. 

1. determine the mission of the club, (everything you do will point to the mission)

Mission of the club: to provide [insert high school name] students an opportunity to perform, participate, and watch drama performances.

You can of course change it but this is a good starting point.

2. determine what you want the club to do (you have limited time and money, if any at all. It is better to do a few things well than many things not well. Master and then expand)

It seems that for the first year, you probably only want to focus on putting on the one act. However, if possible, it would be nice to organize a trip to see a professional drama performance (to help get students excited) in the fall and then put on the one acts in the spring. Then of course have a big celebration!

3. create clearly defined roles (you can also create departments when your club gets big enough but that isn't necessary now).

You will need to have roles and make it clear what each one does: 
president - determines the agenda and leads all meetings. Manages all projects
VP - in charge of recruiting and PR
Treasurer - keeps track of $
Secretary - keeps notes at all meetings
Director of One Act #1 - the director is in charge of working and rehearsing with the actors in their specific one act. This way, you can have all of the one acts rehearsing at once. It also provides more student ownership.
Director of One Act #2
Director of One Act #3 (I am assuming you will perform 3 one-acts.

4. Figure out which one act plays you want to do. You are leading this project so you will have to help out with each and every one act.

Look on YouTube for ones you like. You should choose at least 1 comedy and 1 drama. A quick Google search shows numerous scripts for one acts. Have a bunch of options and then let your directors choose which one act they want to direct. 

5. Create an outlined schedule/plan ASAP and add to it as often as possible - this way you can keep track of deadlines that are set by administration (such s reserving a room) and by you (such as having a read through with all participants.

This is hugely important and should be done over the summer. If you walk into the first meeting prepared (have an agenda that you follow, copies for everyone to Look at, questions for everyone, etc.) people will want to work with you bc you will look and act like you know what you are doing. 

6. Recruit people now for the roles listed above. The key here is to find kids who are interested and not overbooked. Anyone who is already doing multiple activities will not have enough time (most likely).

7. Talk to administration so you know who to e-mail over the summer if you have questions.

Your goal over the summer (when you have the most time) is to create the tracks that you can ride for the rest of the year.

1. Figure out which one acts you are going to do.
2. Determine how you will reach out to students for an informational meeting (students respond to many different mediums - announcements, fliers, etc. See if you can talk to specific teachers and maybe you can go into their room to talk about it for 5 minutes). If you can create a flier quickly that is great. Put in fake info and you can change it later when the time and location become set.
3. What will you say at the informational meeting: what is the club. What is a one act. How students can be a part of it (acting, building sets if necessary, lighting, directing, etc.), how will you determine who will be directing and acting, etc. how often will students prescribe. When and where is rehearsal. When and where is the performance. 
4.  Coordinate with administration when and where is a good time for the one acts. If you schedule the performances at the end of. A quarter know that you will stress everyone out, including yourself. If you schedule it immediately after spring break, you will have people who will not rehearse during spring break and you risk then getting rusty. 
5. Create a list for everything that you have to do and start making a schedule for when they will get done and by whom. 

Lastly, you are about to enter into management. Managing is tough. If you act like you know what you are doing, most people won't question you, but you also have to show others why they will benefit if they do what you want. Having a frank conversation where you ask students what they want to do and get out of the experience, and then connect a role and responsibility to what they said (and describing how they are related) is one of your best tools in getting people on your side. 

On mobile so kind of all over the place. Hope it was helpful. PM me if you have any questions. 




"
highschoolteachers,"Not a journalism teacher, but I was a journalism major in college and I really wish elementary schools had newspapers. I had an amazing advisor in high school who created an incredible, student-run newsroom for us.

Make sure you teach your kids how to write a standard news article (inverted pyramid), and then teach them how to write other, more fun types, like features once they've mastered that. And then how to conduct an interview. And then practice, practice, practice. Do all of this before your first issue comes out, whether it's print or digital (assuming you publish). If you want to read up on writing, I can dig up some book lists from college that might be useful to you! (if you don't have a journalism background, that is.)

Develop strong relationships with admin/department heads/well-liked teachers and coaches/etc. They don't have to love you, but there should be clear mutual respect. You'll need admin on your side should any major news break. We couldn't have covered half of what we did in high school without the support of our admin, because our advisor made a point to form strong relationships with all of them, and, in turn, helped coach us through how to best interact with them so we had no qualms waltzing into the office to request an interview with even the scariest of vice principals. Even if you're not publishing, students can still practice interviewing important people on campus! 

Teach ethics, and consequences of unethical practices. The [Student Press Law Center](http://www.splc.org/) will be your best friend. They have amazing resources for ethical and legal issues, as well as some resources for teachers that look pretty solid. 

If you have the budget, invest in some tape recorders for interviews. And figure out whether your state is a [one-party or two-party consent state](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations). Regardless, teach students to always ask for permission to record conversations at the start of the interview, and to record the entire thing, just in case. Teach them how to take notes during the interview of important things the person is saying, rather than trying to transcribe the entire interview in the moment (which also makes transcription of tapes infinitely easier and I wish I had learned to do this in high school). And, again if you have the budget, consider some reporter's notebooks to go along with those recorders. 

And I want to echo the advice to have a clear hierarchical structure. If it's an intro class, you probably won't have many veterans to turn to for editorships, but you still need student leaders/editors. And journalism is a great place to develop such a variety of leadership skills. Use that to your advantage. The more they feel they own the publication, the more they will put into it. But, you need to be willing and able to step in with a firm hand and calm voice of reason if things get out of hand. At the end of the day, you will need to have final approval of anything they are working on. Don't flaunt it, but everyone needs to be aware. Don't let that stop them from taking risks, but prevent any and all disasters from ever starting. 

If you are printing/publishing something, make sure you know whatever software you're using like the back of your hand, so you can help students when issues arise. And make sure to train them before you let them on, even if they say they already know how to do it. You'll always need to do things like set the proper margins, format tags properly, etc. Even if you don't regularly publish, consider mocking up layouts or a private wordpress anyway. And then find an outlet to publish articles anyway, because it becomes so much more powerful when you see it in print and know people are reading it. 

And also the advice to reach out to local journalists is great. Form relationships with local publications. Most reporters I know love talking about their work with future journalists, whether to a whole class or one-on-one. Maybe also see if you can get a photojournalist to come in and give a talk because photojournalists are just really cool, and could get kids jazzed about another aspect of journalism to explore. Also, look into local programs for high school journalists, and encourage students who truly seem passionate about journalism to go for it. Visit a local newsroom, even if it's at a college. Even though a daily (or even a weekly) is wildly different from a high school newsroom, it can be an eye-opening experience. 

Clearly I am still very passionate about journalism, so i'll stop there. I wish you the best of luck!! High school journalism can be amazing. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm just finishing my first year teaching and recently gave something similar to my buddy who's about to start her first year (she does middle school SS, I'm high school SS/ELA.) Here's what I included:
1) Teach Like a Champion-- I think classroom management is the hardest thing for new teachers and even if you don't agree with everything in this book, I found almost everyone has some takeaway from it. (And it's pretty popular with districts out here, so being familiar with it isn't a bad thing.)

2) A custom self-inking stamp. I stamp kids entry/exit tasks and notes they need to participate in discussions. Works well to get them on task. Found a website online where you can get custom ones printed and designed a mountain bike image in Photoshop, as she's hardcore into that.

3) 5 lb bag of Jolly Ranchers to bribe---uh externally motivate kids when nothing else you're doing works.

4) A mtb themed pint glass I found at the thrift store, six pack of beer, fifth of whiskey, and a flash drive filled with tv shows and movies for those days when all you want to do after work is drink and turn the brain off. Depends on your friend, but I find most humanity teachers love Archer. "
highschoolteachers,"What are you planning to teach?  I think it's really important for math teachers to understand the evolution of math classes our students will encounter and help connect concepts of their classes.  Math instruction is VERY different from taking a math course...it was really important to take curriculum level classes to become a good mathematics teacher.  

I just would encourage you to take some classes or read some books over the summer.  Getting a 50% and then a 73% on an exam your high school students would be expected to pass senior year isn't really setting you up for success as a teacher.  For reference, all of the mathematics teachers at my school scored a 98-100% on our certification exams."
highschoolteachers,"Ohh...

I have a student somewhat like that now.

He comes to tutoring twice a week. Granted...most of the time he'll sit and just do homework and ask me questions every now and then. I'll help him before tests, etc.

Well...his test scores have only slightly improved. Maybe 5-6% overall. He's going to pass the class, but maybe not with the grade he wants.

How do I feel about it? Not that bad really. It's a difficult class. Not everyone's brain is wired the same way.

When students confront me with the perceived difficulty of science/math classes I confront them right back. What about history and english? What about foreign languages? I have difficulty learning a foreign language, but no difficulty with science and math. I don't feel slighted...some people are just better in various areas.

The reason we have things like Honors and [to some extent] AP classes is because there are different kinds of students. I have kids in my on-level Chemistry class making C's and B's who are also in APUSH making an A--and APUSH isn't easy for them.

No one is an expert at everything. People in TV shows and movies are fake. No one person can be an expert in Quantum physics, Computational Chemistry and Psychology all at once. There's a reason we work in collaborative groups as adults. There's a reason it's called a ""Think-tank"" (because you get a collective of experts).

I do not expect all of my students to pass every learning objective. It just isn't viable and no matter how hard you try you can't change the fact that our brains aren't made to be a ""jack-of-all-trades"". Students (like myself in high school) tend to give it their all in some subjects, but they fall short in others. ""Falling short"" may be enough to irk by with a B or an A, but that's more often a commitment of effort and not a commitment of brain-power."
highschoolteachers,"Find out what novel sets, textbooks, etc you have, as well as curriculum and unit plans that you're expected to cover.  If you have no set curriculum, do end-design planning to decide what units you will cover.  Make a rough outline of your year broken down into units.  Write rubrics for every major paper/project you plan to do, or one really comprehensive one that you can modify.  Decide how you will organize paper (all. the. paper.), set up Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google everything (because it's awesome), make a plan for how you will return student work (going paperless? do they have 1:1?  will you let them take tests home?  individual files/hanging folders?).  Get a copy of last year's yearbook, if possible, so you can start learning students' names.  Make it a point to get to know the maintenance staff and office staff before school starts and you start needing them!  Get your keys as soon as possible and take time to wander the hallways and learn your way around (and learn where the good copiers, the office supplies, the good chairs, etc. are).  Get a few posters, etc. that you can decorate with (fortunately, high school doesn't require a ton of this unless you want to) (as well as a desk lamp, some nice pens for grading (Staedtler fine-line are my fave), figure out where/how you'll do lesson plans (online, old-fashioned book, etc) so you can easily access them from year to year.  If you have the freezer space, start making and freezing meals (crock pots on a timer are the greatest) so you have things to pull out and not think about when you get home.      Get into a solid exercise routine if you don't have one already.  Go shopping for comfy shoes, and if you're a girl clothes that pass the cleavage/belly test (because: teenage boys).  Lastly, plan out your first couple of days of school (including finding out what kinds of first day/first week activities the school does - many schools are notorious for forgetting to tell new teachers about those things!) so you don't have dead time to try to fill on the fly.  Hopefully that's enough to keep you busy!  Oh, and enjoy a social life while you still have time for one...the first couple of years really are that bad...but it gets better!"
highschoolteachers,"I haven't taught journalism at the high school level, but I was editor in chief of my college paper. 

Do you know if you have the budget for a print newspaper, or will you be entirely online, or are you publishing at all?

Our biggest struggle was removing/inserting errors into articles. With high school kids especially, taking that time at the beginning of the year to go over what you should look for when writing/editing will help a ton.

Another suggestion is to have a clear hierarchical structure, if you are publishing. The students cannot in any way think they have a say. A newspaper will crumble if it's given a democratic structure. A good paper is a dictatorship. :)

Most of all, encourage your kids to try something risky, whether it's with design or content (not stupidly risky, but something that's out of the norm). This and maybe their college paper are the only places they're going to get to take those risks. Don't be afraid of letting them have fun.

Make sure you get lots of AP Stylebooks! Give them style quizzes, especially on the basics (names, numbers, addresses, state abbreviations for datelines, etc). Make sure they know and follow the SPJ code of ethics. 

If you have any other questions, let me know. :) Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I worded that badly. The campus police officer had the pepper spray. 

Suburban high school in the US.  And, if he had followed through I would have been in trouble. "
highschoolteachers,"Where is this a bigger problem -- in middle school, or in high school? I teach middle school right now and we've had quite a few incidents this year of students posting pictures/comments about teachers online. Luckily I wasn't targeted but I'm pretty paranoid that one day I might be.

But I'm teaching high school sophomores and juniors next year and am hoping that they will be more mature, and that it won't be as much of a problem as it is on the middle school level. Do you think this is true?"
highschoolteachers,"Especially for high school, math positions are hard to fill because they can go to into something other than teaching for a lot more money.  I am a hs math teacher and I essentially have a math degree with a teaching certificate.  If I wanted, I could look into many different options for careers because I have had so much math.  That is the difficulty we have ran into in the past.  Not so sure about middle school, but I would imagine it is a very similar situation."
highschoolteachers,"Also, keep in mind that many high schools are looking to get STEM certified (or are opening up).  There is a huge demand for high school business education certified teachers!"
highschoolteachers,"Hi, I graduated with a BS in CIS and worked as an IT professional for 10 years before I started the transition and entered an MAT program for mathematics education.  I am math certified and with one exam I have added my business education certificate for 6-12, so I can teach many more course that fell under my CIS degree.

I don't think in general CIS masters qualifies you to teach at a college (they might allow it due to needs in the area though).  You can teach at high school level as many schools have needs in technology, but keep in mind, the pay is less if you are not teaching certified.  In my experience CIS prepares you for IT consulting and IT management at large companies, and most schools would be willing to hire someone with CIS and several years working in the field, not just someone with a masters in CIS.

Most states and schools have a MAT in Business Education (which includes topics covered in a CIS degree, but more pedagogical and teaching oriented classes), or you can simply get a certification in business education.  Again, the masters will pay more.   If you are between the fence, you could get a CIS MBA, and pair it with a certification in Business Education with a couple more courses.  I could get more detailed for you if you are in Georgia.

What I would suggest first is to make sure that you like and want to teach as it is a lot of time and energy to invest in something you may not love.  Teaching is so different that I thought it would be, and while I love it, I am so glad that I experienced it first before making the jump.  You can volunteer at a local school as a tutor/coach/etc first to see if this is something you really want to do!"
highschoolteachers,"I start the year with a ppt about me and my life. I show baby/kid/high school/college (appropriate) pictures. I show my husband and I dating and then our wedding. I show pictures of me on trips or pictures of me doing activities. I talk about my friends and now my baby. I let the kids ask my questions as long as they are appropriate. I've starting my eigth year and I know I am a favorite among many of my former students. But I think it helps that I teach high school and that I am still under 30. I always make sure that they know I am not their friend and that although I share ""personal"" stuff that there are certain things that are too private. I also am a hard-ass when it comes to teaching so I think it helps that I make them work for their grades, don't put up with any bullshit but still show my human side which all ends up gaining their respect. "
highschoolteachers,"For MAVNI, there are two criteria, you must be either a licensed healthcare worker, OR you must be fluent in a language that the Department of Defense deems essential to national interest. Obviously since they are in high school, they would only qualify for the language criteria. 

https://www.goarmy.com/content/dam/goarmy/downloaded_assets/mavni/mavni-language.pdf

There are a lot of languages on that list, except Spanish. For DACAs in the US currently, MAVNI is the only way to citizenship!"
highschoolteachers,"I change as soon as I get home, as well. Even though I work mainly with high school students, I just feel like schools are such a cesspool for germs. 

Changing as soon as I get home is also slightly symbolic. It kind of lets my mind know that the school day is over and now it's time to (sort of) relax."
highschoolteachers,"I share a lot of my personal life with them. I want to be relatable to them. I want them to come to me for help or advice. I have sort of a unique story: dated my fiance in high school, we broke up freshmen year of college, I dated a crappy guy who told me what to do, dated that first guy again, now we're getting married. That first guy is also a doctor now and put himself though all his schooling. It's important to me (and my fiance) that my kids hear that they can do whatever they want. Being a doctor isn't out of their abilities. It's good for them to see real humans who are normal who have experienced things in life and made it out successfully. 

Please don't interpret this as me being preachy to them. They eventually figure out that my fiance is a doctor and they assume I'm rich (uh...no. Med school loans are a real downer.), and they ask lots of questions. 

Tldr; I answer almost any and all questions students ask me. I'm an open (appropriate) book. "
highschoolteachers,"Also, if you find your passion is there and can, TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL.  There is such a void of middle school teachers that understand the math curriculum that is coming in high school and college and can build the connections for students as they haven't had the math.  Strong teachers that have math backgrounds like yourself are needed so bad.  So many students from middle school enter my classroom with a memorized set of procedures and complete lack of understanding of concepts.  I have so much respect for the folks who certified 6-12 with me that are brave enough to teach middle school kids.  THEY RULE!"
highschoolteachers,"I worked a stressful job in corporate america year round and decided to change careers to become high school certified in mathematics and business education.  

My summer off this year consisted of taking a 6000 level math course that met daily, and 2 mathematics teaching technology courses.  I had classes for 3 hours every day and spent another 5 hours performing required homework and studying.  On top of that I missed days as I had to travel to my school for meetings and planning.

I will say, even if you get a summer off, teaching is so different and so energy and life consuming.  Even if the duration is 9 months, you spend 8 hours of your day on your feet giving presentations or facilitating meetings all day.  You rarely get a lunch or even time to go to the restroom.  You have to learn how to communicate effectively and clearly with constant distractions happening.  You are making 8 critical decisions every 10 seconds.  You are expected to be awake, alert, and on point at all times.  Outside school hours you are supporting students in clubs, activities, and tutoring.  You are grading, writing and preparing lessons, communicating with parents during that time.

I think the biggest difference between teaching and working an office job is that when I worked in an office and went home at night, I was off work.  I was relaxing and taking some time to myself.  During the school year, it never really stops.  You're talking about your students all of the time, you're worrying about them.  I even wake up in the middle of the night sometime and grab my computer to create supplementary materials for a student that didn't quite understand a concept in class.  The difference is during my 9 months of teaching, I'm working every minute of the day and thinking about my students...so our summers are spent in working around the clock so much!"
highschoolteachers,"I had a pretty fun student teaching experience, but my wife and my roommate both had terrible experiences and ended up changing placements. I'll write about all three separately.


Mine: I was a music ed student. I student taught 6-12 band but going backwards (oldest kids in the morning, 6th graders last period). I had two CTs. The high school CT dropped me in Jazz band to fend for myself from day 1 and dropped me with the lower HS band in week 2. He payed very little attention to what I was doing and let me pretty much roll with the baton. It was fun, but it was scary-like I could easily screw this up and no one would know-scary. In middle school I was watched a little more closely and I had extremely difficult kids (inner-city). Planning for this ate up most of my time, but I always felt like I was skating compared to my wife (fiance at the time) and roommate. I ended up not going into teaching though because of the low pay and politics. 


Wife (Jane for reddit purposes): We'll call her CT Amy (neither real names). Amy expected Jane at school at a particular time. When Jane walked in a square 30 seconds late, it was a *huge* deal. She would regularly tell Jane that she was not as prepared as she should be. Jane would come in and spend ten to thirty seconds to do something in the morning, but be told she should have done it the night before. None of this would have been particularly major were it not for the fact that Amy would report Jane every time. If Jane asked Amy a question -*any* question- she would be told that she was un-prepared. At the end of the first month, Jane was told she had way too much negative paperwork and she might get dropped from Stu-teaching. Jane let Amy report her one more time before requesting a new placement. 


Roommate (John): we'll call his CT Mary (again neither are real names.) Mary was famous in the school for bad-mouthing the other teachers behind their backs and then being perplexed when none of them liked her. She had been at it for years before John became the stu-teacher. Her habit of being negative carried over to John because of his inability to be *impatient* with the students and she would make him write and re-write his lessons until he had two weeks worth of sub-plan like write-ups that scripted exactly like *she* would do it. The last straw was when another teacher told John she had heard Mary saying she didn't think John had done well enough to merit any sort of letter of recommendation. John asked for another CT an hour later and was granted. "
highschoolteachers,"Band rooms are usually the crappiest rooms in the school. We were rarely in them anyway. Usually on the field or in the gym practicing marching. I think my high school band room had all of our trophies on a high shelf, and a clock. That's about it."
highschoolteachers,"I started having students answer (I teach high school, fwiw). The office staff didn't exactly love it, but once they realized that the kids were totally capable of relaying messages, they went with it. The kids get overly excited about answering the phone for whatever reason, and it saves me the hassle. "
highschoolteachers,"Mine was interesting.  I did my licensure in Memphis before the country and city schools combined so I had a junior high placement at a then Memphis City school and a high school placement at a Shelby County school.  Some background for those who don't know, Memphis has one of the worst school situations in the country, it's absolutely awful, which is why you can make upwards of $70k after a few years, but I digress.  Before the consolidation of the districts (and then the suburbs forming their own districts) it was pretty widely known in our program that Memphis city was to teach you classroom management and Shelby county was to teach you everything else.

So my first placement was in a low-performing middle school teaching 8th grade Social Studies.  I was one of two white men on campus teaching 120 students split about 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic (about half of whom spoke English).  I learned more about managing a classroom in 8 weeks than I ever learned in school.  Luckily, my cooperating teacher was always in the room with me and gave me the backup I needed when I inevitably got accused of racism by the students.  Most of the students were there most of the time but I had about 1/4 who out of the 8 weeks of my assignment I saw them about 5 days.  It was rough, I spent much more time getting kids to sit down and stop fighting than I ever did teacher, which is what convinced me that I am not right for those type of situations.  I did have one honors class that was absolutely delightful, I never had to get on to them and I was able to do a TON of actual teaching with them, which is probably what saved me.

My Shelby county placement was a dream.  I was teaching Honors World History and US Government and after a week of observation, my cooperating teacher told me the classroom was mine and just let me do my thing.  I had complete control and I LOVED it.  I was able to establish relationships with the students and looked forward to going to school everyday.

All in all, my advice is this:  
1. You get out of student teaching what you and your cooperating teacher put into it.  If either of you don't make the effort and try, you won't learn a thing.
2. Next, ask for help!  If you don't get any from your cooperating teacher, site supervisor, or administration, tell someone so you can get it fixed.
3. You will want to quit at some point, try and get through the semester before making any decision about it though"
highschoolteachers,"I've seen a lot of pins about organization that just way too complicated to actually work.  Maybe it's necessary for elementary or younger students, but for high school students, it wouldn't be all that necessary and it would drive me crazy trying to keep up with it all."
highschoolteachers,"High school placement: was thrown into teaching all classes from day 1. She told me on day 3 I needed to differentiate  more. 2nd week she tells my professor I'm not fit to be a teacher. Did everything in her power to make me feel like I wasn't fit to be a teacher Week 3 another teacher pulls her aside and says how my mentor was a horrible person and I needed to fail. Last week I'm pulled aside and asked what's going on, and how my middle school placement will determine if I pass or not. Mentor teacher hated me.

Middle school: kicked ass. Mentor teacher loved me, I thrived. Students thought I was the coolest teacher. Received praise left and right. Professor apologizes profusely to me after seeing me in action in this new class. I end up being an amazing teacher in this placement. Last day we have cake and soda.

Not to brag, but I'm a pretty good teacher in a high school setting. That first placement teacher was not a good mentor."
highschoolteachers,"It's really gonna depend on your programs and your cooperating teacher. 

I majored in special education in Wisconsin. I had a full year practicum in a middle school history/language arts classroom with a gen ed teacher to learn about that side of things. First semester I was only there one day a week for a few hours. I was basically an assistant, helped with a weekly email to parents and talked planning. The second semester, I was there four hours a day four days a week. It worked out that she had two groups of students, AM and PM. So even though I only saw the AM students, she was just doing the same thing in the afternoon with new kids so I felt like I had a pretty good experience. My teacher was really OK with almost anything. I taught a whole history unit I made and some parts of the day sort of became the time I took over. But mostly I observed and did assistant type things. It was a great opportunity to just talk to a teacher about things like organization, overall curriculum planning, politics around education, etc. 

In my final year, I was a full time student teacher. But in special Ed you're certified k-12 so my first semester was in an elementary school and my second semester was at a high school. 

At the elementary school, I went to the school in August and did PD with my teacher and although it wasn't required, it made the year start off much smoother as I wasn't learning everything all at once (not just being a teacher, but the layout of the school, IEPs of students, met staff before they were in the throes of school year, etc.). My cooperating teacher was awesome! We game planned how each day would go (which SEA would be with which kid, what groups we would need) and planned on me taking one reading and one math group and she would take one reading and one math group. I really felt like I was part of the planning and the team in general (I got a lot of time working with the gen ed teachers we supported too and they let me lead whole class lessons sometime too)  

At the high school level, I planned and taught our self-container math class every day, helped out in the resource room we ran for one block a day and then my cooperating teacher and I supported a gen ed history class. I made alternate materials/assessments and contributed in the history class to the general discussion as best I could (I was also a double major in history so it was a fun class for me to support). 

In our seminars, my fellow student teachers and I would just talk about our weeks. What I really found out was as long as you had a supportive cooperating teacher, the role is really what you make it. Need to practice parent communication? Ask if you can send emails or be the one to make a call home. Classroom management? Come up with something you lead the class in every day that gives you the opportunity to be in front of them.

I remember some girls in my program seeming kind of unsure of what they were doing or feeling like they weren't getting direction from their cooperating teachers, but you really just gotta try things. You can't get fired (unless you're REALLY bad I guess), so don't be afraid to try new things, even if they don't work. You have someone with you to help out in case something goes wrong, a luxury you won't have later. 

Don't be afraid to be unknowledgeable or make mistakes! Even if there was something I thought I knew for sure, I enjoyed playing dumb or naive at times (because you are in a sense! You're only a student teacher. People should be understanding) and trying to get the best advice I could from other teachers. 

Definitely try and meet your teacher and get your feet on the ground in the school a bit before you need to be there to actually teach!"
highschoolteachers,"It was interesting. I couldn't decide which grade level I wanted to do since I was being certified grades 7-12, so I was one of very few (maybe the only) in my cohort to split the semester up. I spent 8 weeks in 8th grade at a middle school and 8 weeks in 11th and 12th grade at a high school just down the street from the MS. I was hoping the two experiences would make it clear which age group I preferred, but I really didn't end up with a preference at all (and still don't). My 8th grade placement teacher had me just watch for about 2 weeks, then we co-taught for a bit, then the last 2-3 weeks I pretty much did everything on my own. She had a very clearly outlined curriculum, and I just followed it. I also put in grades and sat in on parent-teacher conferences, all with her oversight.

At my second placement, my teacher quickly let me take over her classes after seeing that I was relatively capable of doing so. By the end of my time there, she rarely came in to school at all (which is highly illegal, but our room was out in BFE and no one ever came to check on us) and I did everything. She wrote me one of the nicest letters I've ever received about how amazing I was as a teacher and how she'd want her kids to have me. Overall, I enjoyed my student teaching and felt relatively prepared.

Yeah, no. Maybe it's because I moved to a different state, or had a totally different student population, but NOTHING about my student teaching prepared me for having my own classroom. My students now are nothing like the ones in my student teaching, and a huge part of teaching is lesson planning, which is pretty much all done for you when you student teach. I had to come up with several of my own (very long and thorough) lesson plans for university administrators when they came to observe me, but other than that, I was following what my cooperating teachers had already had planned. Actually figuring out what you're going to be teaching and how you're going to teach it is a MAJOR part of the time teaching takes outside of the school day, and I wasn't prepared for all of that work and responsibility."
highschoolteachers,"I will not add students until they graduate high school and the district has rolled them over to graduate status.

I will not add any parents of students to my Facebook.

I add coworkers that I actually have good rapport with and that I spend some time with outside of work."
highschoolteachers,I'd love to see photos of the finished product! Gives me hope that my high school classroom can be somewhat exciting.
highschoolteachers,"Moving from high school to 8th grade this year. Made an off the cuff comment while getting shown my room after getting hired when we walked into the chemical store room and saw it stuffed with all kinds of arts and crafts, boxes of decorations and what not. All I said was ""Huh, guess I need to up my arts and crafts game moving to middle school."" and both admins snapped around and the head principal said ""Darlin, I hired a science teacher, not an interior decorator. Focus on good hands on labs not on what's on the walls.""

I like my new admins so far..."
highschoolteachers,"Ha! I love this definition. I'm actually trying for a themed class this year (Harry Potter) even though in high school math that theme doesn't make a ton of sense. But as someone else said, it's for me since I'm the one spending 10 hours a day there. 

But it will be fun an exciting. The supply table will be ""dervish and bangs"", where they pick up their missing work is ""the owlery"", if you lose your phone it gets sent to ""Azkaban"" (a hanging shoe rack behind my desk), and of course lots of other fun decorations :) I'm super excited to get back in my room and get set up!"
highschoolteachers,"I work at a high school. My rule fo students is no facebook friendship until after graduation. So far In several years I'm up to a whooping 3 students. 

Colleagues only those who I want to keep in contact with if we change schools and no admins EVER"
highschoolteachers,"We have computers and our kids 3-8 have tablets. We have a limited number of compact digital cameras as well as a TV, Xbox 360, and a Wii U that I can bring in on occasion. Also we have the option of projecting onto the screen in the cafeteria. Farm school just means that we are out in no man's land surrounded by crops and such. Not all the schools in the district are like that, just ours and one of the two high schools. "
highschoolteachers,Find a high school with an AVID program. They are very common in California. They all higher tutors. See if you can get a job or if they need a volunteer. 
highschoolteachers,"I'm teach in a middle school.

1)   No parents at all.  I'll only add students after that student and siblings graduate high school.  
One exception:  I have ""liked"" a page got a former student that needed an organ transplant because the family provides updates on her health and links to fundraising.  

2)  I've added most of my co-workers, but I've worked in the district for a long time so I know them all well.  I haven't added any current supervisors, but I am friends with a former admin.  

I still keep my account locked down and watch what I post.  Our union always reminds us to be very careful with social media; they prefer we prefer we obtain completely but most staff doesn't."
highschoolteachers,"Actually, I'm a fourth generation teacher. Both of my parents are highly respected teachers and are very passionate about education, so it rubbed off. Then I discovered art in high school and I knew immediately I wanted to teach art. :) Also, I've always been the kid who hated not being in school during the summer. Going to my parents' schools during summer was always a highlight of the summer. "
highschoolteachers,"As of now I just have high school. I'll have my CCAF in Info Systems Tech (comes with my job basically) then I'll start taking more classes heading towards what's probably just going to be a bachelor's in general studies due to the limited classes I have available at this time. Once I seperate I'll focus more on something more related either to physics or chem. 

Edit: I worded. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school...the rules:

1. Only former students, 18 and/or just graduated. And they friend ME, I don't stalk. If they post things I hate or they post illegal activity, unfriend. Parents? I've only had a couple ask, and those two were fine with me because I have social relationships with them.
2. No admins, only other teachers that are friends. A teacher I know was just promoted to an admin at another site, but my rule stands. The week I go back to work, unfriended. 
"
highschoolteachers,"1. No.
2. Depends on the coworker.

I teach 7th and 8th grade, a few times a year I get friend requests from students.  I decline them and tell them that the day they graduate from **high school** they can friend me.  Most students don't, I have had a few who do."
highschoolteachers,"I have taught middle school PE &amp; Health for 6 years and I can honestly say this is my favorite age range. I have taught elementary and high school as well and there is just something special about middle school kids. They are just old enough that you can joke and be sarcastic but young enough that they are still kinda scared of you. Be firm to start, have your rules and consequences and stick to them. Once they know you aren't going to fold then you can start to let out the reigns a bit. Have fun, joke, be funny, be approachable, middle school is a huge transition time in these kid's lives and they are looking for someone to connect with. "
highschoolteachers,"I realized in high school that it was my teachers who were responsible for making sure I went into the world a responsible and intelligent citizen, and I was grateful for that considering the alternative that happens to so many others. So I figured I would give back and do the same for future generations. I'm happy with my choice so far, this is my second year."
highschoolteachers,"Pretty proud of the hack I just put together. Smart pen to do all my examples in class (high school maths teacher)... Set up so that my writing appears on the projector as I go. I've got it on record, so every example I do is recorded with audio and goes up on the class page. In the absence of a recording smart board, this will do"
highschoolteachers,"I got my first job working part time (0.6 FTE) in a large public school.  I wanted to work full time and found myself in a similar position my second year and ended up in a charter school in Saint Paul, Minnesota.  I'm starting my fifth year there and I agree with everyone else there are pros and cons.

Here is what I've found ...
PROS: 
- I have total freedom over my curriculum (yes I have to meet state standards and testing but I don't have to keep pace with other teachers as I'm the only math teacher for my grade level)
- I know all the students - charters tend to be smaller so I get to build real relationships and watch my students through the rest of high school.
- I plan my own development. My school encouraged development, and includes a lot of training in their program. The teachers pick what to focus on each year for weekly development.
- Smaller class sizes (we cap at 25, way better than the 40 I had in one public school class)

CONS:  
- Teachers don't have a union and sometimes our frustrations go unheard at the administrative level.
- We get paid less than public school teachers (like $10-$12,000 less per year)
- We work longer hours, because I don't have peers teaching the same class I do all the planning and curriculum creation which takes time.  We also do home visits for all 25 of our homeroom students each year and have a few other additional requirements.

Bottom line, if the school seems good to you try it.  You can gain experience and insight into teaching in any setting.  Ruling a school out solely because it is public, or charter, or private is going to limit you - I am a firm believer that when we peg hole educational options we limit students and education as a whole.

Are there bad charter schools? Absolutely. Just like there are bad public schools, bad cops, bad doctors, and bad lawyers. 

Trust your gut, talk to teachers at the schools you are applying to and you might find yourself somewhere great or you might have one more year of experience when you look for a new job next year."
highschoolteachers,"I use and love INs in my classroom. I agree with /u/TTUgirl about looking on Pinterest - there are tons of resources - and also take a look at ""lapbooks"" resources, which are basically the same thing.

I started using them because I kept feeling like I was drowning in paper, all the time. This way, it was the Ss' responsibility to keep their notebook in good working order and I cut my grading to once a month for the notebooks (essays, tests, etc were extra, but since I wasn't grading everything else all the time, I had more time for them and gave better feedback). The kids responded really well, even the big high school kids - they loved the foldables and taking notes on the pretty pages, even though it was the same stuff we would have done on a regular page. They always have paper for assignments, and yes, there is a lot of time you can spend cutting and gluing,  but you can always have them do that stuff at home."
highschoolteachers,"I disagree with a lot of this. I floated my first year and I have my own room now. I teach in a large high school.

I don't mind if teachers rearrange my desks as long as they are put back at the end of the block. Make it part of your routine if you like, and I don't think there is any problem with that. It's YOUR class and you should be able to set it up how you like.

I would definitely ask a teacher to leave my room while I'm teaching. I think it's VERY intrusive to expect to stay. I'm sure there is some place in the building that teacher can go to with their things while you are teaching. It's ridiculous to have to have another adult in the room while you are teaching. I would feel out of line staying in my room while another teacher was teaching in it. That's not to say sometimes I forget something and go grab something off my desk, but I would never stay in the whole class.

My advice would be to make sure the room is how you left it (this goes for floaters and the classroom holder) and to make sure there are areas of the classroom that are ""yours"" - a shelf, bookcase, whatever it might be, that is off limits to each other. For example, my desk is in my classroom, and I asked the floating teachers not to touch anything on my desk, but ensured that there were other areas of the room available to them.

My advice is to talk to the teachers in your room and agree on common areas and private spaces, and to be respectful of organization and cleanliness.

My other advice is to store pencils, markers, scrap paper, etc in your area of the room for every day use since you don't want to use a cart (I didn't either) and only be responsible for carrying your own personal items (lesson plans, your pens, whatever) and keeping everything accessible. I used binder clips so in case something fell it all still stays together. I also clip pens on my bag so that I can pull it off quickly for when kids come up to have their pass signed or whatever. Keep it as easy for yourself as possible by having as little as possible to tote around with you. You'll get the hang of it, it's not as bad as it sounds and hopefully next year you'll have a better placement."
highschoolteachers,"Unless you look like a student yourself, you know look really young you can tell them. As a child teachers are perceived as old anyway unless of course its high school then they MIGHT use it against you"
highschoolteachers,"The school doesn't have any sports, and there are no prep periods. Even during lunch, all teachers are required to eat in the lunch room with students (this is high school!). "
highschoolteachers,"Get her an abacus.  I remember all the way through high school I would finish my math work early and, I'm pretty sure to fuck with me, my teacher would hand me an abacus and say ""learn to do math with this.""

I never got good at it."
highschoolteachers,"I've had a few in my time as a teacher. One year, all of my students were ""impossible"" but, that year I was teaching at an alternative school, so it was to be expected. A lot of students who my co-workers thought were impossible really weren't that bad for me. 

I think the kids who are just waiting to be old enough to drop out aren't always the worst. Yeah, they don't care. But, after 12 years, I know that I can't *make* them care, so I don't try. I call home a couple of times. Then mom says, ""Yeah, he's just waiting to be old enough to drop out and I don't care."" Then I say, ""Well, if it doesn't offend you, I won't fight with him to get him to do work. I don't want to embarrass him by making him argue with me. And, I don't want to demean myself."" Usually, the parents are okay with that.

The ones who are the worst are the ones who actively try to be a disruption. I've had kids say, ""I don't care about this class, so I'm not going to do anything."" To that, I reply, ""Fine. Just don't be a disruption."" That sometimes works. But, there are kids-usually high school kids who are taking my high school class to just have a full time schedule but don't need the credit-who are just impossible. 

I had one boy for three years (I teach 7th and 8th grade) who didn't do shit in my class. He was retained once. He was often high in my class. He ran his business out of the bathroom. He was a freshman and a half this year and was rushed to the hospital because he was all fucked up in school. We (the teachers) all knew that he was trouble. Having his in my class just sucked.

Luckily, most years I've had way more really good kids than ""impossible"" ones. Don't let the ""bad"" kids get to you.

TL;DR Let the good outweigh the bad. Don't let them see you sweat."
highschoolteachers,"This is so funny to because I feel the same way about trying to teach middle or high school kids. Don't get me wrong my school is a tiny K-12 school and I love most of our ""big kids"" and they seem to like me ( I think it helps that I am a younger teacher and I'm also a giant nerd-child), but I couldn't handle teaching one or two subjects and having different kids every hour. I love spending so much time with my firsties. I have so much respect for those of you who work with the older grades, but I could never see myself doing it. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm starting an online masters in literacy in August. Since I teach high school, though literacy coaches are needed, they're not always in the budget. The degree is mostly for my own edification...and the raise. My district offers a $5000/yr stipend for a masters. Also, is easier to get scholarship money for an education degree. When this is paid off I will go back for Lit. 

My advise is to base your decision on what your district offers for compensation. "
highschoolteachers,"I taught seniors my first year and had several that were impossible for me. They might have been fine for others, but not me. One of them I still I hope I run into so that I can tell him exactly what I think of him. He was mean, rude and thought he was hilarious. Unfortunately, some of his classmates did too. Other teachers said he was pretty awful so I'm not the only one. 

Mostly, I think it was a struggle because it was my first year and they were a tough class overall. And, by the time they are seniors I think it can be hard to redirect them to have a good high school career. Many will go onto better things later, but it can be hard to see the turn around in that year, after so much reinforced behavior throughout the rest of their school years. 

I did have a few who turned around, and went from hating me, or just being apathetic to liking me much more. And some who were enjoyable and didn't cause me to despair of my chosen career. 

My second year, I had sophomores and seniors and I LOVED my seniors. They were 100% great. Sure, some were a little bit of trouble but I genuinely enjoyed all of them. My sophomores were a different story. I had some incredibly apathetic students, or students who just wanted to cause trouble to get attention and it was hard to watch, and hard to deal with. Sadly, I just learned one of the most frustrating students, who could potentially have gotten it together, was just arrested for armed robbery at 17."
highschoolteachers,"I had 2 that stand out. They were best buddies. I teach high school English and they were in a large class that was mostly boys (there were 4-5 girls total) and it was my first year. They were juniors.

They were awful from start to finish. I called out one of them for saying fuck on the first day. The first day! The smart one was defiant and caused huge problems. The dumb one was just a follower. Neither one cared at all about my class and frequently called out random shit when I was lectruing. I tried every intervention I knew how to do. Moving seats, calling parents, writing referrals, calling them out, not calling them out, quiet redirection, open shaming. Nothing worked and I resorted to kicking them out of class when it got too bad. They ended up leaving for online school halfway through the year. 

I had multiple nightmares about those two kids specifically. There was no connection to be made. They were just assholes. They both wrote their personal narrative assignments about a fun shared shoplifting experience. The parents had a ""boys will be boys"" kind of attitude. 

I should end by saying though that I like to think I could handle it a lot better a few years in and that 98% of my students are absolutely delightful. The very few rotten ones don't ruin it for you and I do have a couple great stories about those students that are fun at parties now. "
highschoolteachers,"In 14 years I have had four.  1 girl and 3 boys.   The girl was just our of control and the parents didn't check in and get her the help she needed.  Won't work with me to help her with behavior.  The boys didn't have rules at home and didn't think they should follow rules at school either.  Did things that got adults upset all the time, stealing, swearing, bullying (me and other students).  I communicated with parents, changed up behavior as necessary to try to keep them on track.  3 of them have ended up in alternative high school in the district, the worst and last one is going to be home schooled next year because he couldn't handle middle school.  "
highschoolteachers,"I usually get two a year.  They're usually sophmores for the second time, just waiting to turn 18 so they can legally leave and not have to worry about getting arrested for truancy and being forced to go back to school so are intent on screwing around, trying to sell drugs, coming in ON drugs so they can get sent home for the day (and come back the next day) and when they finally leave, nobody misses them, not even the kids.  

How to handle them; doucment everything, isolate them, don't spend too much energy on them and focus on the other 28 kids in the room who halfway want to be there and actually have a chance to be more than a high school dropout working construction and getting blasted every night"
highschoolteachers,"I have all sorts of bad dreams about school, but they're all school shooting related. That's been a major fear of mine since I was a kid. When I was in high school I had a dream that the school's impact teacher was killing everyone using a giant sword while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. It sounds hilarious but I woke up in tears! "
highschoolteachers,"Every year since my freshman year of high school, I have nightmares about the coming year. It started off simple-wrong classroom, no friends, etc. (btw, I walked into a wrong classroom at least once on the first day of each year of high school). 

Now that I'm a teacher, the dreams range from wild students who are impossible to control to angry parents who have the support of admin, even when I haven't done anything wrong. 

This year, since I'm moving jobs, the dream was that literally everything I was told about my new job was false and it actually turned out to be a toxic environment with no support and ridiculously out-of-control children. "
highschoolteachers,"I bet, I know in my program you have to student teach for a semester. And yes, you pay for the privilege. But the two semesters prior I feel confident there are some classes that are online. Though there is another semester (2nd one) where you have a practicum experience through out the semester in a high school."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;&gt; but I still struggle with taking wild animals out of their natural habitat and confining them to small spaces/cages for the wonderment of strange visitors.

Yeah, uh, perfect example of you inserting your ideology into a conversation where this was not a point. You're Vegan. We know that. We know why. Surprise, the high school kids you're teaching, some have shot guns, hunted animals and *ghasp some cuss like sailors, beat each other up and have intercourse. Some even plan on signing up to become soldiers.... to learn how to kill people. Some might even dream of working at a Zoo, or SeaWorld. I also think Zoo's and Seaworld is fucked up, but is that part of answering your request for advice? Is that part of teaching you my opinion on this matter? Nope. 

Jesus, then don't bring your class to the Zoo if it is your choice.... if the school is forcing you to, bring the issue up with the administration or try and find a solution like the other user suggested. The point I originally tried to make is that it is painfully obvious that you are one of those Vegans who seems to seek out conflict/try to convert people constantly. I can already tell you plan on trying to convert some of the kids. Just cool it, you won't even have time to think about the Vegan stuff when you are trying to create lesson plans, sleep enough, break through to a trouble student, create more interesting material and all the other noble deeds that come along with your profession."
highschoolteachers,"Personally, I understand worksheets as busy work. I don't use them. Whether you want to or not is entirely your choice. However, let me make a case. I read a great quote on this sub the other day that went something like,  ""in middle school you use content to teach tools. In high school you use tools to teach content"". Now, ask yourself,  ""what tool am I teaching using worksheets?""

I suppose you could make a case that in filling out a worksheet the student needs to find the information in the text to answer the questions. Fine, but is that the best use of your time and their energy? Worksheets might have some value, but in my estimation it is marginal. 

Instead, maybe use that time and energy to help them learn to take notes. Perhaps instead of worksheets, have them keep a neat notebook wick you can check periodically (for a grade preferably, or not). Kids need to learn how to take notes, and then instead of searching their text for information, they can consult their own notebooks, written by their own hand. 

Take this for what you will. It is, after all, just my opinion, man. "
highschoolteachers,"There is 10 jobs in Missouri for high school social studies teachers on k12jobspot and a few more on other sites, but I assume the job market may change 5-6 years from now
"
highschoolteachers,"CBEST is pretty easy, I wouldn't waste any time studying for that.  If you were cool on the CAHSEE in high school it should be fine."
highschoolteachers,"For high school, a master's usually bump up your salary 3-5%. However, I've heard people complain about being passed over because districts don't want to spend the extra money. Personally, I think that is extremely rare and not representative of why these people are passed over, but I don't know enough about district politics to say for certain. It might be true."
highschoolteachers,"I was thinking parents wouldn't want to get reminders of every homework assignment and would limit those notifications to tests, projects, etc. I teach high school honors students. "
highschoolteachers,"I empathize with you a lot. My Kindergarten teacher recommended me for the GT program, which didn't start until the 3rd or 4th grade. I didn't get the same level of challenges in the classroom, even though my mother advocated and pleaded with my teachers to give me more rigorous work. When I got bored I would modify my assignments (once, in a high school French class, I completed a worksheet with the fewest words possible without changing the meaning, and then the most words possible without changing the meaning on the next day). In upper elementary and middle school, other students started to notice and harp on my accomplishments, so I started skating - I would intentionally leave problems blank on math tests so that I would get Bs. My mother begged my teachers to mark me down, accurately, especially when I wouldn't complete homework assignments to average down my grades. Instead, they would give me As and a long talk about My Potential.
Basically - my advice - don't forget that while she's brilliant and gifted and wants to talk to you as an adult about books, she's also 11 and is feeling peer pressure and is going through puberty and everything else. She still needs to work with her peers sometimes, and to learn to work with them. I wish a teacher had done that for me in middle school. By the time I was in high school, I had squandered five years of learning and spent them reading novels for myself instead. Not horrendous, but I could have done more."
highschoolteachers,"Gifted students need a curriculum with depth, rigor, and complexity. They also thrive with different instructional techniques. Consider some of the following ideas: 

1. Have her get on Khan Academy and work on math that is on her level. 
2. Have her propose a research topic and some sort of presentation that she will use to explain her findings. She can work on it at home or during specific times in class. 
3. Have her read books that are more on her level. This is difficult, because the topics in late high school books might not be appropriate for a 6th grader. She can still do the same skill (finding main idea, identifying theme, whatever) with the book that is more appropriate for her. scholastic.com/bookwizard is a great place to find book levels. 
4. Give her a chance to go more in depth with the curriculum. Google some project based learning ideas that she can do. 
5. Do not just make her the ""tutor"" for the rest of the class because she already knows it. This does not push her thinking at all. 

Good luck! "
highschoolteachers,"At least in Kentucky, this isn't true. I majored in History, but took content classes in Econ, Psych, Sociology, Anthropology (lol,) and Poli Sci. Currently teaching US History, Economics, and International Relations in high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I haven't taught kids like this, but (not to toot my own horn) I was that kid. I perhaps wasn't quite at her level, but I was significantly ahead of my classmates, especially in reading and writing. All I wanted in school was MORE BOOKS and MORE INFORMATION.  Let her speed through the books/reading you assign and then give her more! Challenge with with high school style essay prompts and creative writing, with books you like - fiction and non fiction, poetry, biographies, classics, high literature, etc. When I was that age I wanted to read everything I could get my hands on. Talk to her about the books she reads like she's a grown up, a peer. 

Talk to her about what she wants out of class. Does she want to do the work other kids are doing? Where/when does she get frustrated with the material or the classroom? Who are her friends? Does she like working in groups? Would she prefer to do the projects by herself? What does she want to study? Find out what she loves, and try and fold that into the curriculum. Since she's not skipping grades, I wouldn't try to single her out - i.e. have her do completely different work - but let her tutor the other kids or do presentations if she likes that kind of thing. 

The most important thing, keep her in the loop. Make sure she knows what you're doing: that you're not picking on her or making life harder for her, you are pushing her to excellence. You are trying to engage her. She probably hasn't been challenged in school yet. Let her be voracious and inquisitive and praise her for going deep and working hard (not just being smart). I learned very early on in my school career that I could slide by on ""potential,"" test-taking skills, and reading comprehension.  And that sucked - for my attitude and for my academic career. Don't let her do the minimum. Ask her for more than that."
highschoolteachers,"This sounds almost exactly like me. I had my certificate, but couldn't find a teaching job. My certificate was in high school but I was placed in a kindergarten. 

They asked about my organization and discipline plans. Just be personable too. They want someone that's there to help keep make things easier on the teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I haven't taught any of these students myself but I am in a sign language class where we have to read books about deaf culture. This one book is called Deaf Again by Mark...Draulsborough? Something like that. Anyway, it talks about his journey from being a hearing child to a hard of hearing adolescent to a deaf adult. In schools he said he had to be able to see the teacher to lip read. He talked about taking spelling tests where she'd walk around the room as she was reciting the words and he'd continually hand in blank papers. He often had to ask classmates later for the details on homework assignments because he couldn't hear the teacher. From what the guy talks about in the book it sounds like giving an outline of the lesson would be helpful so they have an idea of what info they're listening to in case they need to fill in the gaps of what they can't quite hear. Context can make a difference. Also speak clearly so they can lip read more easily. He was saying that sometimes it's a matter of speaking more clearly, not screaming in his face. He talked about being in very small classes and how amazingly helpful it was to have an aid in the classroom to go explain things to him that he missed hearing so he didn't get lost. The aid would pop in throughout the class and help him as soon as he got off track, and he said he did great when that was the environment. When he was pushed to a larger classroom he really struggled trying to do it on his own. Also group discussions could be difficult because so much was going on he couldn't follow it well enough and lip read every person. These school experiences happened when he was hard of hearing, before the deafness set in.

In another book, Intro to Deaf American Culture, they discuss mainstream and deaf schools. In California only a single digit percent of deaf students passed the end of high school exam. They were proud that in deaf schools the pass rate is 30-40%. Not the same as hard of hearing but still, a possible language barrier can make it difficult. The deaf community believes that schools can't really offer what students need because it's not in their language, ASL, and hearing teachers can't relate to their students. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. 
In my experience, many of my coworkers will say things like ""student-teacher relationships are important, but not more important than learning."" I agree with this statement to a point. From what I have gathered, students actively look for ways that they can relate to you. The more the students feel like they can trust you and have a positive relationship with you, the less behavioral problems you will have and more students will be willing to speak out in class. 
I'm not saying I would ""be their friends"" but I think having a positive, trusting relationship with my students is vital. It can be tricky to balance the teacher vs. friend dilemma, but it pays off in the classroom having a positive relationship with students. Ask them questions about what they like to do! Talk to the quiet kids just as much! If a student is interested in a certain topic or hobby, I try to incorporate examples from that topic into my class. Most importantly, be enthusiastic about whatever the students are into, you don't have to like the latest video game or what music they listen to, but if the students feel like you listen to them, you won't have many behavioral problems. 
I made the mistake of being students' friend too much during student teaching. I still got positive reactions from students, but I never felt like a teacher or had much control. I think you just need to find that balance.

T.L.D.R. Be friendly and interested, but not their bff"
highschoolteachers,"I'm assuming this is a new class, with no existing curriculum? It seems completely unreasonable to give you a brand new course with a month to go before the school year starts. Plus, it's not like this is a new course in something that's familiar to high school teaching--ie a Psychology elective or an African American studies course. This is a very new and different way of teaching, with not many examples to follow.

Sorry this is not at all helpful. I'm just worried that you may be a new teacher and they're completing taking advantaged of you and setting completely unreasonable expectations....?"
highschoolteachers,"These were also likely older teachers that have been at it for a while and know what they're doing. Younger teachers that aren't all that much older than high school students are much easier to be seen as a peer by their students. The teacher-student relationship introduces a completely different power dynamic- it would be like seeing yourself on the same level as your manager at work.

Dressing like a teacher is something that goes beyond how students see teachers. It adds a level of professionalism that keeps the rest of society from looking at us like overpaid babysitters/ social workers. These things are said for a reason. Understand that you generally don't get old by being dumb."
highschoolteachers,"One of the things a co-worker of mine and I had discussed was moving from teaching high school aged students (here between 15-18) to middle school aged students (about 12-14 years old). Now, with other students I found that while you (hopefully) gain intelligence and independence to do more demanding work you lose a bit of respect and authority. Older kids are much more willing (I think) to push their limits with their attitudes. Visa-Versa with younger kids, while they may not challenge your authority as much, you may not be able to do as in depth or demanding of lessons. 

With that said, at the elementary level I have heard the 'burn out' rate is much higher. Other than your teaching materials/lessons/content and curriculum you need to consider the other factors of a students life. As a teacher (in any age range) you also take on many other roles. In elementary school with younger students it will be more like care-giver, nurturer, and almost parent. They'll come to you when they need their shoes tied, or fall down, or are having a fight over a pencil. The problems are small to you but very large to them. They'll want things to be fair, if he has it, she can have it to. If they're doing this over there, those kids can do that over there. Accidents, crying, bickering, shouting, etc, all those things are present. With older kids the problems are different, they may not come to you to tie their shoes, but they'll come to you when their boyfriend/girlfriend is acting weird, or when they are fighting with their best friend. Maybe there are issues at home they want to discuss, you become much more of a 'councilor.'

For me personally the reason I chose secondary over primary was just that, those 'other roles' the teacher has to take on. Most of my family/friends find it odd that I do not want to work with little kids because (in their words) ""you're just so good with little kids. Look at how much they (my nieces, nephew, their friends, little cousins, other children) love you! You're so fun and you just get them."" However, while it is easy for me to deal with 5 maybe 6 small children at one time, working with 20 of them at one time sounds terrrrrrible to me. I don't think I could take the 'petty' issues of ""HE'S TOUCHING ME!"" or ""Why is she LOOKING at me?!"" or ""He took my pencil!"" or ""HE CUT ME IN LINE! I WAS HERE FIRST!""

So consider that my friend, while teaching for primary school may not be as educationally demanding as teaching secondary, it will be mentally demanding and it will still pose it's challenges. My family members give their hats to me for wanting to work with the Jerky-self absorbed-over dramatic-attitude ridden teenagers, but it is THEY (other members of my family work in primary school) that are doing the really hard work and who deserve my full appreciation! Consider that it is they, the primary school teachers, who help shape the students they will become.

TL;DR: Both primary and secondary teachers face have challenging careers, sometimes not always with the academic side of their jobs.  Younger students will respect your authority more (IMO) but older students will allow you to have more in-depth lessons, discussions, and projects. Both age groups require teachers to be MORE than just educators. And of course (again IMO) primary school teachers, YOU DA REAL MVPs!"
highschoolteachers,"Being truthful, and going to school soon to become a teacher. The most respected teachers at my school were the ones who were able to just relax and be themselves while being great teachers. Kids my age (high school) prefer someone who is open and honest rather than someone who is uptight and boring. Respect is given to us by those people, and we give it right back. "
highschoolteachers,"To update, I took the closer high school job teaching the subject matter I want to teach. It was hard to leave the staff and school that I spent last year with, but I am excited for the opportunities ahead. The school where I will be teaching this year agreed to give me step 2 and I'm happy with it. I didn't realize how common it was to lose steps when changing districts, so being able to retain mine is pretty cool. The money I'll be saving on gas will be an added bonus :) Thanks for all of your input! "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I just graduated high school. Just trust me on these.

Not sure if sarcasm or youthful ignorance..."
highschoolteachers,I taught high school too I'd thought they get over it a little faster. RIP middle school teachers.
highschoolteachers,"Every teacher I've seen who *started* their teaching career as casual and sharing parts of themselves with the students did not have the respect of the students.  Kids thought their class as a joke.

Every teacher I've seen who *started* their teaching career dressing like their personal college style with an added tie or something was mistaken for a student and not given the respect other teachers, who were older, were given.

Being a first year teacher is hard enough.  Being a first year teacher who looks and acts like a high school kid is terrible.

Perhaps your teachers who shared parts of their life or who dressed like an old hippie and was comfortable over professional were older, or more established.

And that's fine.  I can do that now.  I've been at my school a decade and even the kids who haven't had me know who I am and what I demand in the classroom.  I could wear jeans and sneakers every day and still get the respect I demand.

But this is for **BEGINNING TEACHERS** and they don't have that luxury.  They don't have any prior knowledge about them shared, and if they come off as too casual, which is what comfort and personal stories represent, their classroom will be a nightmare.

"
highschoolteachers,"I taught high school Composition for college-bound juniors for several years. To make learning how to do an Annotated Bibliography interesting, I turned the assignment into a scavenger hunt. The clues changed from year to year, depending on the resources available to us in the building or the types of citation entries students were struggling with. My goal was for them to know how to cite common sources for research -- books and articles from databases, mainly -- but mixed in with practice for those were things like ""a movie you would not recommend"" or ""the best music album of summer"" and so on.  The theme of the Annotated Bibliographies then was loosely based around each student's own interests (rather than the research subject), but it still gave them an opportunity to have a little fun while practicing an important skill. 

A main struggle with the Annotated Bibliography for my students was the formatting. They never wanted to write more (than maybe 2-3 sentences) in the annotations because getting it in the proper spot underneath the citation was so damn frustrating. They also struggled switching back and forth from reverse indents to regular indents (we used MLA). I think if you make it just the right level of annoying, they shouldn't need help being concise. "
highschoolteachers,"I disagree with not telling the students you are calling home. I do agree that you should not use it as a verbal threat in front of the just students. But I have had much success with talking to the student, one on one, and letting them know that I will be calling home. I usually ask the student to come up with a plan to address the problem, something that j can share with their parents. I tell the. The phone calls usually go better if I can discuss the problem and present a solution that the student has already agreed to. It works out well. (I teach high school)."
highschoolteachers,"No offense, but why should annotated bibliographies be ""interesting,"" especially for college students? Either they're useful, in which case students should learn to do them in the traditional way, or they're not, in which case there's no reason students should do them at all.

It might help to make sure your students understand the purpose of annotated bibliographies. My high school freshmen can do annotated bibliographies without getting too bored to complete the assignment. "
highschoolteachers,Using a basic recipe. I remember helping with this when I was a teachers assistant in a high school life skills class. We did a different recipe each week and the students loved it. Just make sure to take allergies and diets into account!
highschoolteachers,"Relationships are the key. A lot of these students need a positive person in their lives. Someone who they can have fun with and look up to, without crossing the line of course. I found it was very helpful to be a regular person to my students... share but not overshare if that makes sense. They don't need a robot teacher, they need and want someone with feelings who isn't afraid to show that but still get the job done.  That's been my experience at my alternative high school anyway. Best wishes!!!"
highschoolteachers,"Alright. Maybe I do have too low expectations. I teach high school, and I just don't expect most other teachers to be able to pass a trigonometry or physics exam. 

But I suppose you are right about middle school knowledge. Though I know plenty of parents that are not comfortable helping their children with their math homework past 5th grade or so.

I had to take a general knowledge exam to become a teacher, I'd say it was about middle school knowledge. But I know people in my college that had to take that exam several times. I don't think you should get more than 2 attempts, but you don't take that exam until you are well into the program and it is hard to say 'You failed this twice, sorry go do something else.'

But I don't think it's fair to say that most teachers are dumb. I think most are average. Which may still be a problem. But then, I think most attorneys are average, most business people are average."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Why do we require a high school education if we are going to be comfortable with a typical individual forgetting what they learned as far back as middle school?

That's certainly a good question. It wasn't all that long ago that high school education itself was not the norm. Most stopped to go work in farms, factories, mines.

&gt;I would not be comfortable at all with a doctor that didn't understand middle-school level science of any kind, whether it was evolution or geology or kinematics.

Neither would I, but it's not that unusual. Hell, we have a pediatric neurosurgeon running for the GOP nomination for president who doesn't seem to understand evolution.

&gt;Maybe you are ok with a teacher having less breadth of knowledge than a middle schooler, but I'm not.

Are you saying that right now, if I gave you ANY exam from any 8th grade class, you could pass it no problem? If you say yes, I'll believe you because I'm fairly confident I could too. but there's a chance that certain topics covered in social studies have slipped my brain and would require an hour to brush up on first. But if you expect every teacher have the knowledge of every subject, then why even have subject specializations? Why not do it just like elementary school with generalists?"
highschoolteachers,"Maybe you are ok with a teacher having less breadth of knowledge than a middle schooler, but I'm not.

I would not be comfortable at all with a doctor that didn't understand middle-school level science of any kind, whether it was evolution or geology or kinematics.

Your response just tells me your standards for the general population are insanely low.  Why do we require a high school education if we are going to be comfortable with a typical individual forgetting what they learned as far back as middle school?"
highschoolteachers,"I student taught for about 4 months and from observing many different teachers at the same time in a high school, I found that every teacher has their own style. Yes, this style can be letting students talk back to you and so on. The question is, does the style work? From what I just read, if students are confused and still argue no. Since you only have to be with him 5 weeks I believe, try to do your best to teach the way you want but don't be too strict. This isn't your class so it is hard to change rules and have students listen to you when the primary teacher has clearly laid out there are no rules. If it matters to you, it really helps to give each other feedback (That's what I did). For example, after a class discuss what you felt was positive/negative/needs improvement/is great and should be used more. That way, it doesn't seem like you are being rude or something to your mentor. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Don't try to be their buddy. 

Don't do it. However, loosen up a bit. I always found the teachers who got to know you better and shared parts of their life were way cooler and much more relatable. I'm close with many of those teachers. 

&gt;Dress like a teacher. 

Sure, but if you have a personal style that fits the dress code, go with it. Be comfortable. Be you. Kids will respect that way more. 

I just graduated high school. Just trust me on these. "
highschoolteachers,"The CBEST/CSET have nothing to do with teaching. They are testing your content knowledge. For example, if you are trying to become a math teacher, the CSET is a test on the high school math that you will be teacher. They just want to make sure you know math before teaching you how to teach math."
highschoolteachers,"A student who only knows 5th grade math does not belong in high school algebra. I would love to hear someone discuss the importance of teachers who teach remedial classes, as well as paraprofessionals. "
highschoolteachers,"Tracking implies there is no movement between levels. The high school I attended had lower level, average and advanced and you could move between them. I failed algebra so moved to ""elementary geometry"" and when I aced that I got moved back up to regular algebra 2. Leveling by ability or learning style is not an issue as long as movement between levels is allowed.

That said research is starting to show that learning style is a myth."
highschoolteachers,My cousin and his wife both teach at a North side high school. She is very active in the union. PM me if you want to know more.
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching middle school for 11 years. During that time, I've taught a few high school classes, but I definitely consider myself a middle school teacher. First of all, middle school students are a totally different beast than high school students. Middle schools are the bridge between elementary and high school. You should highlight the fact that since you know what is expected of high school students, you are uniquely capable of preparing middle school students for high school. However, you should emphasize that you understand how much care middle schoolers need. (Trust me. They're a needy bunch.) 

Do plenty of research on the district. Find out what grades are actually considered middle school. My middle school only consists of 7th and 8th grades. However, I've taught at another middle school that was 5-8. 

They'll probably have teams of teachers-a group of 4 teachers who work together to teach all of the subjects to the same group of students. If the teams work together well, it's a really great situation.  Ask about how their teams work.

Also, depending on what your you'll be teaching, you'll get students with different ability levels. A 6th grader is very different from an 8th grader. Sixth graders are just coming out of elementary. Eighth grade is the last stop before high school."
highschoolteachers,"Big things to know:

1. Behavior management in middle school is completely different than high school. Some issues that are widespread in high schools are present, but rarer (violence, pregnancies, drugs, gangs), while others that are also present in high school are magnified (bullying, habitual dishonesty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, externalized responsibility). Expect a question about strategies with dealing with student bullying, student conflict, or a student in emotional crisis.

2. Because of that, behavior management is more of a focus in classrooms. The value of rules, procedures, consequences, and rewards are far more significant, because of the fact that students need more structure. Expect a question on your classroom rules and procedures--and definitely don't message yourself as a ""I'm a relatively relaxed teacher""-type--those tend not to work well in middle school environments.

3. Added to that, instructional planning needs to more urgently address those ""why"" questions: ""why are we learning this?"" ""why does it matter?"" In middle school, there's less of a built-in ""why"" to their daily attendance in school: in high school, the majority of students see themselves on their way to graduation, and they want to achieve that, whereas in middle school, high school graduation feels decades away. Added to that, middle school students are developmentally more incapable than high school students of understanding cause/effect relationships when it comes to their actions, so they rarely see how their daily choices affect long-term outcomes. Lesson planning and classroom structures need to address that. Any answers you can give in your interview about goals or motivators that you hope to incorporate into your classroom will be good.

4. Teaching middle school can be especially exciting considering that many educators consider middle school to be a major turning point when it comes to students' attitudes towards and choices relating to their education. Most middle schools prioritize developing students' character, and teachers are in a position of creating good student habits and attitudes, as well as instructing. It might the worth asking, ""What are the traits and skills of the [school name] student?"" in your interview, because that will give you a sense of what kind of character-building your principal wants to take place. 

Hope these help. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Former middle level, current high school teacher history teacher here. As we're standards based, essentially, only quizzes (checks for understanding) and tests (summative assessments) count for anything. So..I don't currently face the struggle of daily work or homework- kids who have practiced (or not) earn a grade appropriate to their ability on assessments (with the option of retakes).

As far as larger assignments (essays and such, which can take the place of traditional tests), my drop dead date is at the completion of the next unit. In other words, if a two week unit starts in January and you flub the paper, you've got until the end of the next two-three week unit ending in February to hand it in. Otherwise, I won't accept it. The caveat, of course, is the end of the semester, where that date shifts to one week prior to the end of the semester. It's a pretty reasonable plan, and my admin, who are large proponents of standards based, have backed it to date."
highschoolteachers,"Hi! So I accidentally answered this question (when the person was asking something else) but I kept it up in case someone ended up asking how to be a teacher in CA! To be fair, these are the steps to get a multiple subject teaching credential, which is for those looking to teach K through 5th grade. If you want to teach middle or high school, you'll need a single subject credential.
&gt; 
Hi! I'm actually starting a teaching credential program to become an elementary school teacher in the summer so I have been going through all the requirements. To teach kindergarten through 5th grade in California public schools you need to have a multiple subject teaching credential. You can get a multiple subject credential by enter a program, usually three semesters. I am going to San Francisco State University's credential program but many schools offer them. Most if not all of these programs have similar requirements. 

&gt;* Hardest part you have out of the way: a BA! A BS works too but you definitely need undergrad out of the way.
* You need to have hours of observation in a public classroom during school hours, no after school programs or religious school classes count. I've heard the number of hours range from 45 to 60.
* You need to pass the [CBEST](http://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com/about_CBEST.asp)
* You also need to pass the Multiple Subject [CSET](http://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com/test_info_CSET.asp?t=101) tests. 

&gt;There are a bunch of other little things programs want like a second language requirement (my high school Spanish covered this for me), letters of recommendation, Livescan fingerprinting and background checks, as well as a TB test. If you would find the total list helpful, here is the application packet I followed for my own program. It is a pretty large PDF, you've been warned! https://coe.sfsu.edu/docs/cstpc/download/MSP_packet.pdf

If you wanted to do a single subject credential (In history/social studies?) then there may be different requirements. Much like the scary PDF above, I found the single subject credential program offered at my school if you want to check it out. Schools may be different but the basics of what you need to do are there. http://coe.sfsu.edu/docs/cstpc/download/SSP_packet.pdf

Good luck with the CBEST! I took mine last summer and it was a breeze, the CSET was the one you need to study for.
"
highschoolteachers,I use this in high school to review by letting them write answers to review questions in the shaving cream.  I consider it a bonus that they're cleaning my desks.   
highschoolteachers,"Sometimes I get a little uncomfortable with that because it feels like I'm lowering my expectations for the most high-needs students--which doesn't do them well when it comes to being prepared for opportunities later in life. If I truly believe that my students could all be successful in school and have access to great colleges and careers after high school, I want them to be able to meet deadlines, study for tests, and work hard. (In addition to learning the content and skills they need to know in my classroom.) Saying, ""Oh, well, you're homeless, so you don't need to do this homework assignment--but you, you have a stable home life, so it needs to be front and center Monday morning"" can feel like code for ""You're homeless, so I don't expect you to accomplish much in life, but you come from a position of comparative privilege, so I want you to have access to future opportunities."" 

Do you know what I mean? I'm thinking through this as I'm writing; I've taught some of my current students for several years and know their families and home lives very well, so I find myself frequently making exceptions to general rules based on my knowledge of their own struggles at home--which lately has made me a little uncomfortable, for the reasons I'm describing above."
highschoolteachers,"I can see that. I work in a fairly middle-class school. 

I think most in my department will take things on a case-by-case basis. My issue is when a student just doesn't do something, never contacts me about it, and then wants to make it up 3 weeks later. I will almost always say yes to a student who asks me about late work within a day or two of a due date, but beyond that, I feel take advantage of. 

I think my issue with the policy my department is suggesting is that they want no penalty at all. In the real world, you might be late, but there is a consequence for doing so. Maybe you get written up or passed up for a promotion or your boss is just pissed, but there IS a consequence. And in college, there is rarely leeway for worked that simple isn't turned in without an adequate excuse. A significant portion of our students go to community college or straight to university out of high school and I think our policies should refelct that. "
highschoolteachers,"Have them maybe explore some topics they may be interested in. For example...if they really like marvel comic book movies, have them explore where marvel came from, who stan lee is, etc. If they like history, have them explore some of histories mysteries such as the ark of the covenant, area 51, Sorry if this seems silly as I am a high school teacher"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school math teacher. I usually only have two types of assignments: daily homework, checked for completion and worth four points, and then chapter reviews, a blend of completion and accuracy, worth fifty points. 

For daily homework, I give students the full credit if it is turned in on time. I give three points if it's turned in before first period the next day (The rationale being: hey, it's late, but the student made it a priority). Two points if it's turned in during class the next day. I don't offer half credit or accept assignments after one day late. If homework is a consistent issue, I have offered students a 'makeup packet', which consists of useful assignments, one page per homework that they want to make up, which I give them one week to do for half credit on missed assignments. The only caveat for this is that in order to get this opportunity, the parent/guardian and I are in contact about this and the student has to either call them or have a conference with them and explain why the missing homework has been such an issue (granted, I teach in a district where parent/teacher relations are pretty standard, but I think this keeps this assignment option as more of a hassle for most students).

Chapter reviews I am a bit more strict on. They are given to students about three days before a test and are due the day of the test. Because I typically use it as a study guide, I post answers on Blackboard the night before the test. This has caused a lot of issue for me when students don't turn it in. I'm sure that this is not the ideal method, but I only accept it late up to a week after the test date, and I don't give a penalty. I assume that the students use this as a study review -- if they do well on a test, I know that they understand how to do the material, and if they test poorly, it gives them a chance to get points in a less-stressful environment. I've debated between accepting it late or not because the answers are available, but what I've found is that typically students who are turning it in late and do not care about the material are typically are not the ones who bother getting online to copy the answers. 

Hope this helps!"
highschoolteachers,"On the other hand, the students also know the teacher's problems and quirks. I would actually recommend leaving out describing last years problems and focus on telling them only the:""this year I'm dedicated to prepare you all for high school, so there are going to be some changes to how we do things"" and then tell them about new rules/procedures and stick to them. The first couple weeks will be the hardest because they will want to fall back to how things used to be, but once they see that the teacher is being constantly consistent they should be able to move on. 

(sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, English isn't really my first language) "
highschoolteachers,"The middle school here has a great pbl program that entails taking middle school kids into rural China for a month to learn math and sciences through irrigation building and sustainable living. The Buck Institute is our go-to for the moment in the high school. However, PBL can be simple too. For example, to teach argumentative essay construction and evaluation, I have the kids design and build a museum display. Artifacts are student-made replicas, and they must argue a point through the artifact displays. The key with PBL is that you must have meaningful reflection. Ask open questions and be patient for the answers. Bells and schedules kill PBL. 
"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;I've never really thought about this in the context of myself as a teacher, but my high school physics teacher was assaulted by a group of students on his way to his car a few years ago. When he defended himself and knocked one of the students out, he was asked to resign.

As you briefly describe it, this legally doesn't make sense. Can you explain what further details explain his being asked to resign?"
highschoolteachers,"Aside from trying to diffuse the situation, there isn't a lot you can do. If physical aggression is a common then the problem may be embedded within the framework of the school/district/society. 

If you can't protect yourself due to your age, gender, size, etc. you probably shouldn't be teaching in a high school setting. That may sound harsh and unfair, but it's realistic. Sadly, if these societal trends continue, teaching qualifications will resemble those of an MMA fighter. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree with everything you said. I'm 6'2"" 280 and a former college football player/HS wrestler. Size and appearance is a huge advantage, even in high school. Nonetheless it is always important to not lose your cool if a student does act out in such ways. "
highschoolteachers,I have to say this to my students frequently. I teach high school biology. There are many exceptions to the basic concepts that we teach. These exceptions often make it into our discussions. However I always emphasize that they will be tested on the generalizations and should not include the rate exceptions when testing. The students do get it.
highschoolteachers,"I wouldn't advise getting your masters right away...you can price yourself out of a job in a lot of districts (beginning teachers are always a bit of a risk, and having a matters with no experience makes the financial investment significantly higher).  If you are limited in which districts you will apply to, go to the admin or hr directly and talk it through with them, as they may prefer that you have an MA.  If your options are wide open, I'd hold off until you have a couple of years in the classroom.  The first couple of years of teaching is all about learning what actually works in a classroom, not what should theoretically happen as you learn in many colleges.  A masters program will be more valuable after you have started teaching, in my belief.  Plus some districts will pay for it, or at least help.

You can, however, make yourself more marketable by doing a lot of tutoring and volunteering in classrooms.  Get as much technology in education training as you can, with certifications or any kind of formal achievements.  also, get certified to teach AP.  If you have any second language background, work on bringing that fluency up to enhance your communication with students and parents.  

I think it's wonderful that you're choosing to follow what you love instead of what will make good money...teaching high school kids is the most rewarding career i can imagine!  Hopefully your family will see your passion and enthusiasm in time!

Edited to add: don't panic about the age issue...actually, being older when you start is easier in some ways, add you have more maturity and a bigger age gap from your students.  It's very challenging to start teaching when some of your students are only 3-4 years younger!  "
highschoolteachers,I teach high school English and Social Studies. I get a 30 minute break for lunch. I also get around 35 minutes of prep time before home room. I also get 25 minutes after the students leave for prep 3 days a week.
highschoolteachers,"In my district it is unusual for a student to ""earn"" anything less than an A prior to high school.  I've argued for a while now that I'd rather they just not give them grades at all but rather just give them constructive feedback.  

If you teach freshmen (math at least), you can expect an email from a parent almost every single time you enter anything in your grade book that is less than an A.  It's awful.  Each email will start off by telling you what score the kid got on the state tests last year and how they have never gotten anything less than an A.  It's difficult for parents to understand that the grades given in middle school and the grades given in high school are not based on the same things."
highschoolteachers,"Sounds to me that being liked was indeed one of your goals.  I never said, nor did I intend to suggest, that being liked should mean lacking limits or letting kids do whatever they want. I set very high expectations and very consistent limits with my 1st graders (as I did when I taught middle school and high school), but I never asked them to respect me because of ""my position"".  Instead, I show an intentional and authentic concern for them by noticing their individuality and needs.  I also do not believe that setting a goal of being liked means that kids will never disagree with me or be upset with me.  They get upset with me frequently.  However, I always find time to meet with them and talk about their feelings and my expectations (and how those connect with their learning goals) when they are ready to have that conversation.  I agree with everything that you said, I just call most of that ""being a likeable person"".  Kids like and respect consistency, authentic interest and honesty.  Kids do not like or respect people who insist that they respect them because of their position.  That is my experience, anyway."
highschoolteachers,"Bandaids! I'm wrapping up my first year as a high school teacher, and I am thankful that someone advised me to buy bandaids. You'd be surprised how often they hurt themselves. "
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school we got our Calc teacher/Mathlete coach a pi clock: http://www.amazon.com/Clock-teacher-professor-classroom-radians/dp/B003MASYPS

He loved it, and I'm pretty sure it's still up in his classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching high school social studies for 11 years. The best thing I did for my organization was to keep very detailed records of what we did in class each day. I just use a simple word document. I plan lessons and then go back to record details of what I actually used and will use again. Everything I create is saved electronically and BACKED UP regularly. When I file papers, I try to keep everything will be used to lead up to a summative assessment (test, project, debate, etc..) in a single folder. Everything does change every year, but that word document is gold for me each year to help me remember what worked and didn't work from the year before. Hope this helps.
"
highschoolteachers,"My mom's cancer came back senior year of high school, more or less pausing my life, and all of my final assignments were late. I was a shy student and a sign like this would have seriously discouraged me from approaching my teacher to explain my situation. If my instructors had presented this sort of attitude I would not have graduated."
highschoolteachers,"As its own class, in my area it's very rare. I know of two, maybe five high schools tops (in an area where there are close to 40-50 in an hour radius) that offer it. Most schools around here include a strong Art History component in the art classes. 

Also, it's an AP class at all of those schools that offer it. I wish every school offered it, but I'm an English/History teacher so I don't even think I have the necessary certification to teach it. Love ""modern"" humanities though. "
highschoolteachers,"It is a normal feeling, and one you should pay attention to.  Do you have any experience teaching or tutoring?  Have you done any classroom observations?  Teaching is not a profession to be entered into because you need a job...the stakes are simply too high.  I have known a few teachers (all in the sciences) who became teachers without any education background or preparation...one was a natural teacher and had taught undergrad courses, TAd, and tutored extensively.  He did well right out of the gate.  The others crashed and burned; one limped through the school year but had angry parents at his door or on the phone nearly every day, two were fired mid-semester, and one quit after two months.

I'm not saying that you can't make the transition successfully from lab to classroom; however, do not enter into it lightly just because you need a paycheck.  You do hold their educations (and GPAs...never underestimate how much high school students and parents live and die by the GPA!) in your hands."
highschoolteachers,That's non existent in my area. All of our students take art history for dual credit in high school so it's essentially outsourced to the junior colleges.  You might look and see if you can find someone's syllabus posted.  Some Art I classes that I've been in/around had a strong focus in art history though. You might consider a job in that capacity.
highschoolteachers,"I started tutoring in high school at $15/hour.  When I got to college, I raised it to $20.  After I graduated college, I raised the price to $30, then to $40 and finally $45. 

However, I found that a lot of people couldn't afford $45 an hour, so I dropped it back down to $30, and got a lot more customers that way. 

In the end, it's about what you think your time is worth and what the client can afford. "
highschoolteachers,"Are you set on teaching high school? You can be TA in grad school, get your grad school paid for, and go on to teach college. You only need an MS to teach at a community college. That is how I got started, although I didn't intend to teach-- I just wanted help paying for grad school and realized that I like teaching. If you do want to teach high school, then that is another matter. It also changes a bit from state to state. You may have to tell us where you are at for better help."
highschoolteachers,"Former international school teacher here: depending on where you taught (i.e., anywhere other than in Europe), be prepared to be very proactive in explaining that you were teaching in a REAL school, fully accredited, with proper American/British/whatever curriculum.  I spent a few years in Asia and a few more in Africa, teaching middle school and high school English Lit and History, and I cannot tell you the number of people who assumed that I was living in a village, gathering up homeless orphans from the nearest mud hut and spending the day under a tree teaching them to count and say the days of the week in English.  No joke.  

Even if they never bring it up, be really proactive about it so they don't get any false ideas about your qualifications.  While most admins consider international experience an asset (particularly if you're applying to a district/school with any amount of ESL/exchange students), there are far too many that really don't think there are real schools outside the US.  Sad but true!"
highschoolteachers,"Absolutely agree.  As educators of students who may or may not have supportive families to guide them in character education, it might have to fall on us to guide their moral/ethical development.  Calling out stupid actions as such is very important in that development.  

Caveats:

1. This is different than the KIPP's standardized education model.  I don't think character can be reduced to mere numerical factors.  That bastardizes character development's goal and changes it from developing intrinsic characteristics to getting higher numbers.
2. Successful people internalize failure and misdeeds very differently than unsuccessful people.  Some of my lower performing students don't have the moral development/maturity yet to internalize failure productively, and as such become disengaged from school.  This is why we can't coddle them, but also need to provide them the social and emotional tools to deal with failure.
3. Moral/character development also burdens us with reflection on our biases and prejudices when it comes to value judgment.  For example, I understand that growing up in the US I have a decidely capitalist-utilitarian bent to value calculus, and as such I need to interrogate the roots of my assumptions when it comes to determining what is good and bad.  I think it's very powerful, especially in high school, to have conversations with students surrounding epistemological questions like: ""Why do we believe going to school is good?"", ""Why are we told to obey authority?"", etc.

Interesting we're both Physics teachers, huh?  ^^I ^^know, ^^n ^^of ^^2 ^^=)"
highschoolteachers,"One of the best things would be that experienced teachers be the majority of the school board. Democracy has been a disaster for school boards.  Elected politicians may decide the budget allotment but not how it's used. Also, enforce pyramid spending in districts. The majority of the money needs to go to the classroom directly. When I worked in the US, the money would be allotted to districts but disappeared at the administrative level.

We should move away from high-stakes testing. Standardized testing isn't bad. It does allow me to see how my students progressed through the year in one facet of their education. It should not be attached to school funding, salaries, or bragging rights. It's a marker for how Little Johnny did that day compared to another day. 

Self guided for motivated students is fine, but you need an infrastructure in place to allow for early graduation and transcript reporting. You also need a Plan B for less than motivated students. 

My school is using PBL for many of the classes and getting mixed results. The problem is how to assess it and what do you do about time limits? Some kids will take longer than time allowed. What do you do when you need to get to the next unit? However, the students love it. We've had much more success with it at the middle school level than high school, and I think GPA importance is why. In high school I'd like to see vocational arts such as shop and home ec make a comeback to give students another avenue of success.  

"
highschoolteachers,"Band when I was growing up was never an extracurricular activity. We started concert band in 6th grade, which eventually became marching/concert band in high school. It was a class. If someone didn't show up to a concert/competition they pretty much failed that semester, and if someone didn't behave well at those events they definitely were docked points.

Football, basketball, soccer, cheerleading, those are extracurricular activities. Something required so you can meet what the state says you have to have is a class."
highschoolteachers,"I disagree with the first comment - I think you should stick at it and get the NQT. That doesn't mean I think you should stick at the same school, though...

Reasons: 1) Once you do, you're qualified for life and can always go back later. If you don't, you'd have to do the entire year again. I'd say six months extra is worth that option being in your life, especially at your age.

2) I don't think, personally, that your degree course was the best way to do it (I did my PGCE at Imperial too but only after a four-year masters and three year PhD study), and I don't think either that putting you as the sole physicist in a large high school was a good way to start that career. Your observations and experience of teaching are tainted by this - that doesn't invalidate them, it's just that there is definitely another view to be had.

3) The NQT year is harder than the others. It gets easier when you don't have paperwork to fill in and observations to do and resources to make every damn day, etc, and as you become more secure in your subject knowledge you teach better lessons. You can enjoy it more.

4) ""Which means I pretty much have to stay until at least Christmas, and if I'm staying until Christmas I may as well stay the full year."" Rubbish. Get out of the (what sounds like an) awful school as soon as possible. Get to a good school where you are trained effectively and supported properly.

5) ""It looks bad on my CV to only stay for a year in a school. It would look probably even more bad to leave at December."" Also rubbish. Moving every year isn't perfect, but absolutely nothing wrong with leaving a bad job to go to a good job, and any decent employer will agree. Many heads will also understand the situation you're in as well. 

6) You can move schools in the middle of an NQT year (or in your case, summer). This is absolutely a possibility. 

Finally, who trained you at Imperial? Contact them and ask their advice. 

Secondly finally, feel free to ignore this. Just giving the other side of the argument."
highschoolteachers,"First year of teaching high school. I was halfway through Lord of the Flies. A parent called to complain because her precious snowflake was failing because he wouldn't do the homework revolving around the book. The principal came to me and asked me if I was indeed reading Lord of the Flies. I said yes. He said, ""Novels are not on the state test. You will stop reading this book and remove all assignments related to it."" I was untenured at the time so did what I was told. Still makes me angry and ashamed. 

Tenured now at the same school. I read four novels a year now. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school physics. I've moving to making everything multiple choice to ease on grading, but I feel like some things need to stay free response. 

How do I make a routine? As in, how do I decide what a routine should be and how do I get the kids to follow it given that they haven't had routines all year? I kind of have routines, but they just happened. I never planned out what they should be. "
highschoolteachers,"Investigate the University of New Haven masters of education program. Classes are at night at a campus location near you, and your tuition is covered if you sign up for their internship program. 

You'll work full time at a Connecticut school, which, if you're coming at this from no experience, it's pretty invaluable. 

When you talk to them for more information they will tell you what kind of teaching certification you'd be eligible for. I went there for Elementary Ed, but they told me I was awfully close to being a certifiable English teacher. I kept that in mind during my job search and the fall after I graduated I started as an English teacher in the high school. 

It was a quick turnaround, within two years I was teaching. "
highschoolteachers,"I used to use it all the time (I just started teaching this year; middle school and high school), and the kids really responded to it when I was consistent with it. Consistency is the only way Class Dojo works. Once I slacked a little, it took everything I had for the students to respond to it. 
I had to create specific awards as well.  My most used  Positive were Answers Questions, Volunteers (Pass out papers, etc), Reads Aloud, and a general On Task and Quiet for spontaneous rewards. My most used Needs Work were Disrespect, Off Task, and Talking Out of Turn. 
Over the summer I hope to polish it up, get parents on board by relying on its new messaging system, and consistently use it for middle school (my high schoolers hated it!)
Though I am leaning away from rewards-based discipline after having taught a year, I originally used Class Dojo so students could earn points and ""buy"" rewards depending on their points (e.g., 10 for Candy, 25 for homework pass; 150 class wide for special activity, etc). I don't quite like rewards-based discipline, but I found it difficult to convince the students why they even should earn points without some type of reward. 
All that said, Class Dojo seems to be so full of practical uses. They constantly update new features, and I'm sure it would be well worth it should I rely 100% on it. "
highschoolteachers,"One thing to add to this discussion, as a teacher with a visible forearm tattoo, is that the ""covering up"" option with high school kids is going to breed an intense and unending curiosity.  My kids have been unbelievably focused on what it says under the bandaid/sweatband/whatever else I cover it up with whenever I'm wearing rolled up sleeves, since day 1.  So... depending on how you handle student focus on your body and person, that's something to consider."
highschoolteachers,"I have a large forearm tattoo and taught high school. Now, I live in California so we may be less concerned with tattoos here, but it hasn't been an issue. Now that I am peer coaching at elementary, and secondary schools, it does mean that I personally feel required to keep it covered so I don't distract students in these schools. When I'm in the office it's always covered, however standard dress there is a dress shirt anyway. I might go into admin and my largest concern is that many assistant principals wear polo shirts with school logos but for me that might be an issue since they regularly meet with parents. It gets hot here so the thought of doing daily supervision outside in a dress shirt when it's 110 degrees outside doesn't sound pleasant. As for labs, if you're truly concerned with safety and chemicals you should wear a lab coat anyway. "
highschoolteachers,Wisen up. You're a teacher of high school students. They say a lot of false information so they have no credibility. Its not like you heard student X raped student Y. It is weed. Its not the biggest crime of the century. 
highschoolteachers,"I've been working for the last 7-8 years in research (road safety), including doing a PhD. This year I decided to make the jump into high school teaching and have gone back to university to study education. Loving it so far, just started my first prac and its full on but sooo much more interesting than research! 

I don't see it as burning my bridges: if I ever want to go back into research, having some teaching/education background will only help because it will make me a better university lecturer as well."
highschoolteachers,"I've been made fun of for running slowly all of elementry school, and then when I get to high school the first thing my teacher did was change my stance and I ran my mile 5 minutes faster. Some things are just ridiculous. "
highschoolteachers,"A former coworker met his wife when she was teaching in the room across the hall. They married, had kids, both got promoted to principals of different schools (she in the feeder middle school and he to the local high school). Their working relationship was very professional but people still talked, like how she preferred giving him better placements or adjusted policies to help his numbers. It's a target of gossip which I found irritating. But they're very happy together and she eventually went to district while he remained at hs.

He did warn me to keep home life and work life separate, they had to make efforts to not talk about work at home."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a foreign language teacher that used to work at a high school that required us to turn in daily lesson plans to our admin supervisor. So I had to learn how to write plans effectively or salve all weekend in them since at one point I had four preps (20 plans a week, kill me).

Anyways, use routines. Write a really good routine in the first 20-25% of your class that helps the kids practice skills. I had a rotating routine of questioning and answering (speaking and listening) that I put in the beginning of each class but you can do reading exercises or writing prompts, whatever suits your goals. I spent hours thinking this through and plotting it out and then just copy and pasted the framework in my weekly lesson plans with new questions and small assessments updated for each week. Therefore the bulk of your work is built in and you just worry about the questioning parts.

On top of that I had a lecture framework I used (listed how I would lecture and would break down the content: teacher led, whole class practice, check for understanding, questions) and kept a word doc of all the different activities I could implement afterwards for kids to practice skills independently.

You spend a lot of time building your lesson plan repertoire but as long as you work smart, stay consistent and save all the individual portions of your plans, it's fine. My admin loved my lesson plans and I even won a lame little award for them. So as long as you could justify  why you're adding the parts you're adding, you'll be fine. Repetition is good for language classes anyways."
highschoolteachers,"I would avoid putting anything in writing, which makes you responsible for it. You can report it if you feel like it's a problem, or you can sit on the information. Unless they're doing it in the school, there's not much you or the admin can do. When I heard some similar rumors at my urban high school, I encouraged the kids to make better choices and even told one parent, but to no avail. There are worse things than selling a little dope to your friends, right?"
highschoolteachers,"Good luck with that! Is this elementary, middle, or high school? "
highschoolteachers,"Love doing Pascal's triangle with the high school kids.  One follow-on activity is the birthday paradox.  If they have factorials and pascal's triangle down, it's an activity with enough interesting paths to the answer that usually a group of even mildly self-motivating kids can work out the (very surprising!) answer with a little bit of time."
highschoolteachers,"Sticky situation, for sure. I played football in high school, and one of the positions I played was on kickoff. That meant we kicked the ball, someone on their team caught it, and we sprint straight at them while the ball is in the air with every intention of flattening whomever caught the ball. This is the most dangerous part of the game, as you might know/realize. I was the fastest kid on our side by a large margin. I usually missed the tackles because I was running so fast, I couldn't change direction when I got up to the other team, so I'd blow right past them. Not this time, though. This time, I was lined pin straight with the guy who caught the ball and there was nothing anyone could do to change what happened next. As I look at him, I realize he's just standing there, eyes wide like a deer in headlights, and knees bent, but completely paralyzed. At that point there was nothing I could do, I was already jumping to make the tackle; it wasn't my fault he did nothing to protect himself. I didn't even bother wrapping my arms around him to take him down. I just threw my shoulder into his chest, knowing that would be way more than enough to get him to the ground. The sound of our pads colliding was so disturbing that both side lines and everyone in the stands went completely quiet. I honestly felt pretty good about it. Getting a chance to completely bury someone like that is an accomplishment on the field. I get a bunch of high fives and helmet slaps from my team for making a big hit, and then I look over as the coach is helping the kid take his helmet off. Then I realize something wasn't right. I thought I concussed him because he looked funny, so I started walking over to check on him, but the ref stopped me and sent me back to my side. Later on I found out he had down syndrome and they only let him on the field because the game was pretty much over and kind of a blowout. Words can't describe how mortified I was. There was a crushing guilt, but I eventually realized it wasn't really my fault. Was infuriated me was that the coaching staff would let this kid play that position... It's like letting children play in traffic. I was so disgusted that I quit that week and never played football again, which I regretted tremendously later on in life.

Football is a dangerous game for kids with average cognitive abilities. Letting a kid with a cognitive disability play is just immoral. It might be crushing to him, but there are plenty of other sports out there. Even wrestling would be better."
highschoolteachers,"Remember all the hoopla about concussions in the NFL and how injuries are underreported, you can't tell me it's not the same for high school. I player ball 3 yrs in HS, shit is sketchy. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm surprised you would still want to teach social studies.

If you do go back to school to get certified (I am unclear if you dropped out of school, or just a certification program), you should get a dual certification - social studies 9-12 but *also* plant science/environmental science/natural resources.

I know of a vocational high school that offers 'majors' of Natural Resources, Park Management, Environmental Science, Outdoor Adventures.  

While it's a small field, you never know if you just might find a job with that as well.

And also obligatory:

You will work weekends and every holiday your first few years.  But it will get better.  I'm in Year 8 of Teaching and I have a set of quizzes to grade and a quiz and a test to create this weekend and that's it.  It's going to take me two hours, tops, to do what I need to do this weekend.  So it won't always be bad.  I put in maybe 45 hours of work every week.

Plus I just slept until 9am today."
highschoolteachers,"I'm going to be frank.  Your job sounds awesome to me.  And you described it as fun.  Besides the pay and schedule, why are you so dissatisfied with it?  Is it because no one cares?  No one pays attention to the subject matter that you're presenting?  That's my number one issue with my job too!  As for the schedule, you'll probably be working most weekends for your first few years anyways.  It also is ridiculously difficult to get a job as a Social Studies teacher, so you will pay lots of money to get certified, and then you might not even find a job.  Or you won't find one for a few years.  Or you'll be working in a really tough district, where you'll also be unhappy.    

Also, why did you quit during college?  Answering that question might help you to figure out if you have what it takes.  Was it just because it was at a middle school?  Because in my program, we had to do a placement at middle school and high school.  So you'll probably have to get through another middle school placement.  You are certified 7-12, and need to be able to teach all of those grades.  With jobs being so tough to find, you should be willing and able to teach any of those grades.  

Sorry to be so blunt, but I think you're suffering from a serious case of ""grass is greener on the other side-itis"""
highschoolteachers,"At the high school level, how could they be used properly? I'm not talking about classroom management, I mean how can they be used in a way that's conducive to learning? Textbooks are still too expensive and/or not cost effective to be replaced, so... ?
I've heard a couple arguments for use at the elementary level, but never any for grades 9-12."
highschoolteachers,"All of the teachers I know who offered to coach have been stuck with those coaching jobs.  Just know in advance that if you do that, there's a definite possibility that you will be a coach for a very long time.  Also, I don't know where you are but my school hired 5 new high school social studies teachers last year who aren't coaches.  There are 16 people in the department at my school and half of us do not coach.  If you really don't want to coach, there are jobs out there that will let you focus on your classroom!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school science and I send notes home with my students when they are doing really well in class. It makes the kids feel really good when you notice them doing well instead of when you just call them out for being disrespectful or being behind on their work.

I set aside time in class for the students to ask science questions about things they are interested in. In middle school this ends up being a lot of ridiculous what-if questions about black holes in the center of the earth and what if the dinosaurs hadn't gone extinct. In high school it was a lot about the feasibility of various sci-fi plot lines - zombie viruses, space travel, cryogenics.

I also have a mohawk and dress like a punk-rocker This earned me a lot of respect from the students in the middle school as well as at the high school I worked at previously."
highschoolteachers,"My friends and I hung out with our latin teacher in high school, outside of school....all women/girls. I think the key there was having a group. Does thw student have some peers they can bring? I have generally been taught not to be alone with students, ever. "
highschoolteachers,"I have a system that solved this the first day I used it. When I collect an assignment, any students who didn't turn in an assignment have to turn in a ""pink sheet"". This is a document I designed that has the student's name at the top, and reads: ""I did not turn in ___________ assignment because: _______________"" (and they have to give a reason). That way, you have instant documentation that a student didn't turn in their work. I also refuse to allow students to leave completed assignments in my mailbox, because they can come in and say, ""but I left it in your box yesterday!"" I used to accept papers electronically, but stopped when students began to say, ""I forgot it, can I share it with you during 5th period?""

Not sure what age level you teach, but this has solved all of my ""organizational problems"" at the high school level."
highschoolteachers,"True true, but my kids use ""My internet died/crashed"". Guess it works better for high school than for middle school kids."
highschoolteachers,"I am the person who will answer the awkward/inappropriate sounding questions about the human body... which are generally the ones that students genuinely want/need answers to.

What is poop?  Check.
Do we have to poop? (as in, is there a way to opt out?) Check.
Why does a penis get hard? Check.
Is drinking two Monster drinks for breakfast really that bad? Check.
Why do guys have nipples? Check.
Wait, what do you mean the white stuff that comes out of you isn't sperm? (high school girl asking this)  Check.
Should I go to the doctor for this? Check.
The list is endless."
highschoolteachers,"Yes. It not only makes you more marketable, but also you'll need it even at the  high school level. Many students are behind in their skill with English even though it may be their only language."
highschoolteachers,"I started teaching ESL in Korea with just a BA in Lib Arts. Then got my MA in TESOL and wanted to teach at. Korean university, but met a girl (engaged now), and my path has shifted. Short story version.

Bc I didn't do a degree in education, I was severely deficient in necessary credits for a teaching degree. Therefore I had to apply to NYC Teaching Fellows. Not ideal, but now I'm getting my second MA, and in my early 30s with little debt, have already maxed out the pay scale and am lucky enough to have landed a position at one of the international high schools through my experience. 

Honestly, I'd recommend you do a path similar to mine. It's not an easy life (been pretty broke past few years), but when I'm done with fellows (more $, no more grad school), and get $17k of my student loans forgiven for working in a Title I school for 5 years, I will be pretty damn happy."
highschoolteachers,I actually have never tried substitute teaching. I've volunteered with middle school and high school band programs but that's a whole different story I'm sure.
highschoolteachers,"I usually  organise my room so i can pull a chair up to most groups as I circulate as I like a balance with mostly standing but a few minutes to rest my feet. I stand to talk to the class and to circulate the first time, then sit to go over things with the groups/students in detail where possible. I am a high school teacher so this works well.  

 I am on my feet for about 2/3 of the time but I am never over tired from it. I am not fit after a few ankle injuries  but found this worked when I was fit as well.  The tip I was given was to change shoes immediately after work and/or alternate shoes.  Works a treat to stop tired feet.  "
highschoolteachers,"I never said anything about &lt;1% being an official ""statistic"". There's no way for anyone to know what the exact percentage is because there is no way to measure that. Figure of speech... not clear enough? Also, everything I've said here is based on my personal experience, and of the 100s of people I've talked about this with, the number of homo-""phobes"" is exactly zero. I never claimed to be a reliable source for your college thesis, though. 

&gt;Again, where are you getting that from?

It's common knowledge that UCs and CSUs cannot. Never researched any other states. If it's not the case wherever you're from, then raise awareness to vote to overturn it, by all means. Never heard of discrimination not being allowed except in history books and ridiculous bills that never get passed. 

&gt;...black people receiving harsher punishments than whites for the same crimes, or gay people being violently attacked for their sexuality.

This never appears in the local paper that I check regularly. I only ever see these claims on social media, and the stories are usually a combination of absurdly distorted, exaggerated and/or isolated incidents that attract internet mobs. There were a total of 2 black people at my high school of well-over 2000, both of whom I shared classes with. Their skin color was not mentioned once, because it never mattered. Then again, you're probably more experienced with areas where crime is actually a thing, because crime--especially *violent* crime--is virtually non-existent here. No one is out there to get you for whatever silly reason. 

&gt;I wish what you were saying was true. But for many, many people, it is not.

I'll be moving around quite a bit for the next few years, so we'll see. "
highschoolteachers,July is usually a slow month for admin as their responsibilities are light so many of them will use vacation during that time.  They almost never take vacation over breaks like winter break or spring break (maybe a long weekend but that's it) and most work at least one weekend day during the school year so they do not come out a head.  I think being a high school principal is one of the toughest education related jobs out there.  I have no idea why someone would want to do it.
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math. We have an overhead projector. I (and the majority of my colleagues) lecture using the overhead. It saves time. (No erasing, drawing shapes, etc). I'd just be writing on the board anyway. When I give them class work I'll walk around to make sure people are on task, then sit if everyone is ok. We teach 90 minute blocks. I'm not standing for that long. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a male teacher in a high school and had 2 colleagues leave on maternity leave recently. We fellas do tend to ask a lot of questions, primarily I think because both students and teachers realize the job isnt easy and you are experiencing something we cant, so it's a mix of curiosity and helpfulness. Unless you tell us whats going on- we're pretty much clueless as to what you're feeling."
highschoolteachers,"As a student, the teacher nearly always sat with us in a desk for discussions and most of class in my high school English classes.

As a teacher,  I occasionally sit on a stool. I stand and walk constantly,  though.  Gotta see what the kiddos are up to. "
highschoolteachers,"Well, we can only assume that the teacher is effective. In general, I'm finding a HUGE lack of professionalism from staff and students. 

I mean, I teach middle and high school. I don't expect the same from a elementary teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; Because I can't imagine how someone could stand for 6 hours a day!
&gt; 

Two things:

1.) Be in shape. I stand nearly the entire day, but I exercise regularly and eat correct portions, so I never feel physically tired from teaching. (Side note: I believe that portion size is the number one goal in losing or maintaining weight. Even more so than eating ""healthy"").

2.) Dr. Scholl's. I know you said you wear orthopedic shoes. Stuff some Dr. Scholl's in there as well. It softens every step, which is so important for healthy knees.

I'm no doctor. I teach math. But walking around the room while lecturing is extremely important in a high school setting. It gives you so many opportunities to spot check understanding and to maintain engagement without needing to directly enforce it. Don't fall into the trap of sitting while lecturing early in your career.

And lastly, don't label yourself as an introvert and accept that as fact. As soon as you do, it becomes part of your self-image, and it's very difficult to break out of bad habits because ""that's just who you are"". You are NOT an introvert. You are a person with introverted tendencies. Step outside your comfort zone and start walking around the room while you teach. Suddenly, you won't feel so introverted anymore."
highschoolteachers,"In New York, our high school Regents exam week is the last week in January, marking the dividing line between the two semesters, and my due date was January 19th, so with a mostly uncomplicated pregnancy I decided to work up to Regents week, which meant I wound up working a couple of days past my due date.  (As it turned out, I gave birth on the 26th.)  Everyone was supportive and even impressed that I was working so far into my pregnancy except for one admin who complained at me because I wouldn't be there to proctor during Regents week.  She wasn't even kidding.  (She left the school the following year, and people breathed a sigh of relief.)"
highschoolteachers,"It was fine until the 8th month. Students were fine, admin was supportive. I teach in a high school with roughly 2500 students. We usually have multiple pregnant teachers each year, so admin is used to it. The last few weeks were difficult for me due to the physical awkwardness and I also had uncomfortable Braxton hicks contractions during the entire last 5 weeks. I left on maternity leave at 37 weeks despite my plan to stay until 39 weeks.

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science. The kids are amazing (once they know) and will want to do everything for you. At least mine did. I was able to get admin to cover me the few times I needed to go pee towards the end. My kids found out earlier than most because I had severe HG during the entire pregnancy. Those science sinks come in handy! ;-) I also needed to sit towards the end so I lectured from my desk and my kids did EVERYTHING for me. It was as good as it could get. Now...returning afterwards? That was difficult. I pumped for a year and I had to be a huge bitch about my breastfeeding rights. The year after was way worse than the being pregnant part (work wise). However, I survived. And you will too! Good luck! "
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, the teaching part was a breeze. Everyone wants to help and the kids even behave better if they know you're pregnant (before you're showing). I teach high school and surprisingly the boys asked me more often how I was feeling than the girls. The hardest part was preparing for maternity leave. Make sure you have established your classroom routine and the kids know how things operate. You want to be able to come back to normalcy and not chaos. So, overall as long as if you need help, ask. Keep your supervisor in the loop on how you're feeling or if you need more support. In my district, there is no light duty and I had issues with leg pain while standing during pregnancy and I was told I would have to go on leave early if I reported it or turned in a doctors note. My supervisor knew about the issue so did not say anything if I had to sit more often. "
highschoolteachers,"Expect the students to ask a lot of questions.  Sometimes they are genuinely interested,  other times just trying to get you off track. 

For this reason,  one of my coworkers denied being pregnant even when she was about to give birth.  (Sarcastic responses are a survival tactic at the high school level. )

Apparently, our administration wanted a specific day for leave to start for one pregnant teacher. Apparently a range of dates,  or ""I will teach until my water breaks"" were not acceptable.  As a result,  she spent about a week off before the baby arrived,  and had a shorter time to enjoy the newborn before coming back to work. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm pregnant. Seven months next week. I haven't had any drastic accommodations made for me. Most of my students know by now (the slow ones are starting to figure it out finally!) but there are lots of teachers who don't know (I work in a big school and teach at one end of the building). I just found out last week who would probably be my long term sub, but I'm currently spending my winter break prepping maternity leave plans. I teach three preps so it's quite a bit stressful coming up with 6 weeks worth of LPs for each one. I'm a little curious was accommodations we will have for pumping breast milk...I assume my principal has told the rest of the APs, but they haven't mentioned anything to me about it yet (they're all men, so maybe they don't want to offend me or something?). Anyway, overall it hasn't been that bad other than being tired. The kids are so nice about it (high schoolers) and will let me sit while I teach when/if I really need to. If I have to go to the bathroom, sometimes I just say ""okay class, we're going on a restroom break!"" Which of course they love because they get a few minutes of break themselves."
highschoolteachers,"I only graduated high school 5 years ago and it was the same story, some guys wore suits but most wrote dress pants, shirt, and sometimes tie. Some barely wore more than khakis and a polo. Nobody ever really looked out of place.

As far as I know jeans weren't allowed, even on Fridays. A couple of the music teachers wore jeans a lot but typically with a blazer. I swear half the administrators would get lost in the music wing if they ever tried making it all the way over there so nobody would notice if they ever did dress that way."
highschoolteachers,"Your average, sensible adult/ teacher is not straight-up seeking out gays and asking them to ""hide"". I find that a lot of redditors like to get angry at the sub-1% of people who are *actually* intolerant and blow up inconsequential non-issues like this into some humongous deal. Where I'm from, this kind of thing isn't even discussed--with such a glaringly obvious solution, it doesn't even make a decent debate topic! A gay male teacher at my high school would always casually refer to his boyfriend for tons of funny anecdotes. I, nor anyone else in the class, ever cared that his partner was of the same sex. My circle of teenage and adult friends were much the same. It feels like a lot of people just like to contrive issues to get angry at just for the thrill of adrenaline rush; this whole thing is no different than the ""euphoric atheist"" and ""twice enlightened anti-neo-atheist"" maelstrom going on in other subreddits. Honestly, the grown-ass adults who protest and whine about this nonexistent ""rampant homophobia"" (read: FEAR and HATRED of gays... awfully strong words, btw) disturb me far more than the innocuous tweens giggling at less-common sexualities. As a matter of fact, being gay is--by definition--technically ""abnormal"" in the sense that it deviates from the norm. No one is discriminating against them--I, and everyone I've met IRL (not on the internet) sure as hell do not! Wow, I didn't know you were gay! Wow, I didn't expect you to be 7""8'; that's taller than Yao Ming! Wow, you're the first person I've met who actually likes olives and eggplant yogurt! These are all abnormal traits beyond a person's control, and no one hates or excludes them for it. "
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school 10 years ago a few teachers in my school wore suits. I now work in a school district where yoga pants and blue hair are perfectly normal. 

Also it depends on your locale too. "
highschoolteachers,"We had that when I was in public high school.  Midterms week was all minimum days,  too."
highschoolteachers,"Does anyone else at private high school have midterms week? First year teaching and it seems really weird to me that there is a whole week taken away from classes to give midterms, and another week taken away to review for them."
highschoolteachers,"Currently 22, student teaching high school juniors and seniors. It's weird but necessary.  "
highschoolteachers,"Ugh.

I haven't had a kid swear at me yet, thankfully.

I love it when you teach a class in middle or high school, and you get a kid who has had you in another class, and they're happy to see you."
highschoolteachers,"I am a third year high school math teacher. This is primarily my experience and I work in a high needs low income school because I wanted to.  I work in a brand new charter schools, 200 students, grade 9-10. Primarily Hispanics. 

Stress: you'll be overloaded with stress for the first year or two. In my case, it was adjusting to an actual career and organizing/recreating lessons. One thing you have to learn is to borrow from other teachers. Never ever create something from scratch. Google the hell out of everything and combine as you please. For my curriculum, I was happy to use Mathematics Vision Project to teach integrated math 1-3. 

Workload: having the curriculum already made, the workload wasn't difficult after the first year of playing around with the lessons in the curriculum. My second and now third year are such a breeze. I don't lesson plan after work and I only plan during my prep, that includes grading exams and professional support. 

Pay: I get paid a lot for how long I have been in teaching. I work in southern San Diego (near the border) and my salary  is in the upper 50k. I have free BTSA (this clears your credential) and fully paid for professional development from my school. If you were to calculate the amount of days I work compared to my mechanical engineering friends or software developer friends, I work less than them, have less work days, have full benefits, and more vacation time than them. Yes they make more than I do, but factoring the time they work compared to me, it's actually pretty similar. Most of my friends earn 80-120k but work almost every single day and do not get much vacation. If you were to make my teaching schedule like their work schedule, salary would be similar. So I am not complaining. 

Conclusion: there are a lot of people who will say that teaching is stressful, that you will lesson plan after you finish work, that you will go above and beyond for your students, that you will have no life for the first few years. I disagree with those statements.  You will find that you like some students and dislike others. It's okay. Some students are complete assholes. I documented everything from minor infractions to complete disrespect. Then I called for a parent teacher conference or went for a home visit with all my evidence. I fucked up a lot of parents' image of their ""angel"" of a son or daughter. But it felt good. 

1) teaching is stressful, but so is any serious career you pursue. I find my stress healthy. 

2) I never lesson planned outside of my work hours unless I had nothing else to do (which happened quite a bit). 

3) going above and beyond is not an expectation for many schools. If your school decides how good of a teacher you are by test scores, then you need to reconsider your school site. Performance does show skill of the teacher, but it isn't everything. 

4) I've seen a lot of my teacher friends vanish from the world because they are consumed by their work. That's unhealthy. They focus so much on their work that they get burnt out. I've learned from my apprentice years that work will be there regardless of how much you do before or after work. 


Teaching is an amazing career and passion. I love it and I would have never dreamed about leaving. It really is up to you and how well your teaching program prepared you. A lot, and I do mean a lot of the teaching programs out there are a complete joke, and that's why you get a lot of teachers who cannot handle the workload because the program never taught them how to do it. 

I'll be happy to share more details if you want. 

"
highschoolteachers,"Parenting and teaching are not the same thing. I have people tell me fairly often that classroom management will get easier when I have children. Unless parenting is like trying to teach 30 children, several of whom speak little to no English, high school level language arts, I'm gonna disagree with you on that.

Oh wait, it's not just 30 children. That's just one class period. Make that, like, 110 children.

I love my job. Just don't tell me all knowingly that parenting will make teaching easier, or that teaching will make parenting easier."
highschoolteachers,"I also do not want it to be easy to retake a test, but I want students who genuinely have a need for it for whatever reason to be able to do so. It's less about more students taking advantage of the policy (I do not want to grade 150 exams once and then grade them all again) and more about giving students who were just having a totally off day for whatever reason (they got the worst night's sleep ever the night before, their dog died, they had to work instead of studying) a chance for it to not send their grade into the gutter. So for me to even bother giving a retake, they need to show me that they've done some things to be prepared. It's wasting their own time and mine to give a retake if the student is going to do the same level of work. In the past I have sometimes done things like giving an optional study guide and offering bonus points on the test if they do the study guide, but participation in that has been pretty dismal amongst the students who actually need it (which will also be the case with the test retakes, but at least in that instance I know that if parents get upset about grades I can say that I have a retake policy their child chose not to take advantage of).

I know in principle I prefer the idea of a student taking a whole new test to doing corrections on one that's already been graded. 

I teach a couple sections of freshmen and a couple of sections of a relatively low-achieving physical science course along with a couple of upperclassmen courses. I want a policy that I stick to for all my classes, but I want it to have room for my freshmen, who are maybe still getting used to high school level classes, to improve their test grades if necessary. But, like you said, I would like to send the message that it's better to study the first time."
highschoolteachers,"The short response is that it doesn't mean that you will get the job. 

Here is an example. My wife is an elementary school teacher. One of her first jobs was teaching high school home ec replacing someone on a mat leave.  She asked the principal if she should do a diploma in home ec. He said that he couldn't advise her to do anything. Sure enough, the home ec teacher who my wife was replacing came back to the job. She didn't stand a chance to get a home ec job in this district. "
highschoolteachers,"I've been telling people the easiest way to fix the SPED teacher shortage is to give them a $5k bonus every year.  It's easy to find kindergarten teachers, but try finding people who want to be high school  EBD teachers for the same pay.  Many jobs pay extra for hazard pay; working with potentially violent youth should count. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school theatre teacher who landed with a middle school rotation (9-weeks per group) this year. Even middle schoolers don't grasp much of what we do with the high school group, so we spend a lot of time playing theatre games.

I try to teach (and in some cases this means reteach) stage directions and the proper names of the spaces that we use. We ended our last term by putting on a one-act play that was age appropriate and great for that particular group (""Rutherford Wolf"" by Thomas Hischak, samuelfrench.com).

I recommend looking at Pioneer Drama for shows that are simple and appropriate for children. Program-style performances are good, too. It lets kids not have too much to memorize, which lets them be successful with the little bit they do remember.

But, team building games, games that teach listening-then-responding, games that teach and push toward the extreme ends of the movement and vocal spectrums (spectra?), and creative drama in general would be good for the young 'uns. "
highschoolteachers,"Some names definitely roll off the tongue nicer without a Mr. or Ms. at the beginning. My physics teacher shared a classroom with another one, and the teacher who wasn't on duty would acknowledge as much so we started doing it too.

Come to think of it, except the teachers we were scared of (or respected so deeply that it amounted to the same thing), we all called our high school teachers by just their last name or even their first name by junior/senior year. Definitely a culture thing, so I know as a teacher I'd probably stick to ""Mr./Ms. Soandso"" when students are around, and first names if we were friendly. (And since I work with ELL's, that's a whole bunch of culture clash so better to err on the side of politeness.)

At my college we generally call professors by their first names outside of class or just their last names, depending on department. If a professor is pushy about being called ""Doctor"" we usually call them ""Dr. So and so,"" but most don't care. I work in my major's department, so I can't ever go back to using their last names unless I'm talking about them to somebody who has no clue who they are. It makes the first day of class really awkward for me when I introduce myself and I'm like ""ya, I make copies for Professor'sFirstName so...sorry in advance about that."""
highschoolteachers,"You get heaps of holidays.

Sure I get a few extra weeks off. But mid year and mid semester holidays I generally end up working most workdays. In the end of year holidays it takes a good 2 weeks of not looking at any work just to wind down. I then start planning for the year ahead, working 3-5 most some days a week. 

It's kind of a lifestyle being a teacher in my opinion.

I teach high school maths and science at a public school in a capital city in Australia."
highschoolteachers,"I knew I wanted to be a teacher when I was in high school, but like you, I got to student teaching and questioned everything. I came very close to quitting myself. I cried myself to sleep every night and dreaded waking up. 

I realized it was because I had this ideal image of what teaching would be like that wasn't true at all. I was a hard working, focused, motivated, and respectful kid and I had students skipping my class, disregarding rules, and refusing to do work. But as a student teacher you have to fight so much harder for respect- the real world and having a class of your own is SO different. 

You just have to take what's in front of you and be flexible. I have such a strong passion for reading and writing and that's what kept me going. I get to show up to work and talk about a subject I love with students that make me laugh everyday. I don't even feel like I'm working. If this is what you want, stick to it! Student teaching is tough, teaching is tough, but it seems like you think it's worth it. I'm so glad I didn't give up. "
highschoolteachers,"Really hate saying it, but make it meaningful to them. Or fun. I'm not saying you aren't trying--god knows I constantly try, but at least my students know they'll fail if they sit around.

Make some really fun lessons (if you are able) that grab their attention. They can't do the fun stuff if they don't do the work beforehand. They can't participate in anything fun without the work beforehand. Make sure they *have* work that covers the same material though to cover your arse.

This sometimes works in high school. It might take a few lessons before they actually try and cooperate, but hopefully they'll get there."
highschoolteachers,"My first year, I had ""that kid"". He wasn't awful, but he would not. shut. his. mouth. *EVER*. It was so frustrating. If I refused to speak over him, I could barely get through a sentence. If I reprimanded him, he would be quiet for about 2 minutes. He would talk to anyone who was sitting next to him, no matter where he sat. If I put him at an isolated seat, he talked to himself. If I pulled him aside to talk to him, he would ""Yes"" me, then go right back to his behavior afterwards.

Now, this was my first year, and I started mid-year, so by the time I realized it was a problem, I felt like there was so little left of the year that I just wanted it to end. I imagine I would handle him differently, now. Or at least escalate faster, and call home to see if that helped. 

But, in the 4 school years since then, I haven't had another one like that. I mean, sure, my kids are not all perfect angels, but for the most part they're really good.

Then again, I did have one class period last year that I liken to watching a room full of puppies. Bouncing off the walls energetic. Well-intentioned, but mischievous. The just wanted your love and attention, but the moment you weren't focused on them (because there were 20 other puppies in the room), they'd pee in the corner. LOL. Not literally, of course. But they did break TWO expensive pieces of lab equipment because they were, quite literally, acting thoughtlessly. 

I always have a kid or two each year that simply won't take class seriously, or put in more than the barest minimum of effort. But they're generally not disruptive to others, only themselves.

Edit: I can't believe I forgot the follow-up story to ""that kid""! The next year, he came back and asked me to write him a college recommendation letter! I told him he should find someone else, because his behavior in my class did not warrant a recommendation. He came back and insisted that since I was his science teacher, I needed to write one. I refused again. He insisted a third time. I agreed. Well... my exact response was, ""If you need a letter, I will write one, but I'm not sure what you think I'm going to say in it. You should ask someone else, someone you showed more respect to, but I will submit a letter if you insist.""

So, *then*, I decided I would ask him a few questions to see if there was actually even a glimmer of something to write about.

*What do you want to go to school for?* ""Electrical engineering. That's why I need you to write the letter. It looks good if a science teacher writes it."" 

*Okay... So, why do you want to study that?* ""My dad says it's a good job."" 

*That's it?* ""Yeah."" 

*Okay, then... so, what else have you done in high school? Any clubs?* ""Golf team for 4 years.""

*Great! What did you learn from that? What did you get out of it?* **shrugs shoulders**

Fine, kid. I'll write you your letter...it may have included the line ""*** is a capable student if he applies himself."""
highschoolteachers,"Hi y'all. Doing Texas Teachers for high school science &amp; economics right now. Here's a question I have.

In our training, they told us to do hand-written thank-yous after meeting reps at job fairs. I know this is pretty standard advice, and I also know from being involved in hiring at my former job that sometimes these just get dumped, because we got hundreds of applicants per opening and the *qualified* person would get hired--not the one who badgers you like a car salesman. To me, an email with one sentence was preferred just so I have you in my contacts.

That said, is anyone here experienced in hiring? Does this really make a difference?"
highschoolteachers,"Probably.

You'll see it again and again, though. When I started the job I have right now, I had French 3 students who couldn't even begin to use être and avoir in the present tense. Even now, I have students coming up from the middle school who don't know what a noun is.

There will always be students who don't deserve to pass passing. It's a symptom of a flawed marking system and grade inflation. This would be a problem without grade inflation, but in a world where students don't do anything except to get a better number in a digital book, and where teachers are actively discouraged from issuing failing grades to students who did not meet standards, we're going to see more and more flukes rise in the ranks. 

Our funding is tied to our graduation rate, our graduation rate is tied to grades. Who cares if a kid graduates high school without the ability to add? All that matters is that he graduates. Even better--let him enroll in college, find out that he didn't get the education he thought he did, and drop out. There's no way to track it, so our school's numbers go up anyway!"
highschoolteachers,"I can't speak to you so much about the hours question but I can say I just finished my student teaching under a cooperating teacher who left engineering for teaching.  He worked for a major airline in the Philippines for years, got into teaching university classes to supplement his income, and then eventually immigrated to the US to teach high school science 10 years ago.  And he loves his work.  While he a trained engineer, when he refers to himself it's as a teacher.  Basically what I'm trying to say is that it might definitely be worth it to you, particularly if the pay isn't that big a deal to you."
highschoolteachers,"Just to give you an idea to go one step further - the teachers at our school all bake 3 dozen or so cookies and bring them in during finals (high school teachers).  We then make plates and distribute them to the support staff.  They have to be baked or they get thrown out.  (They reason that anyone can go out and buy cookies but you have to think about it and actually bake cookies to show you care.)

We also take up a huge collection during thanksgiving and give food to the neighborhood families.

It does incredible things for the atmosphere of the school."
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school and I taught high school for seven years. To me, your rules sound a little harsh. There are a lot of reasons kids don't take notes--laziness, sure, but also dysgraphia, stress, exhaustion. Make sure you're not violating any IEPs or 504s with the way you're running the class. I have students who just physically and mentally cannot keep up with taking notes. 

I agree that students should show drive or interest improving their grades. However, the impression I got from your post is that you might come off as cold or possibly indifferent. I have found that students will work hard for teachers who care about them. Based on your post, I don't know if you're showing that. 

I know it's hard to change gears at this point in the year, but maybe a few get-to-know-you icebreakers after break would be good. Make sure you're sharing stories about your life and asking them about theirs. 

I apologize if I took too big a leap there. "
highschoolteachers,"Probably the most sensible thing is to sub for a couple of weeks to see what that's like (except for all the work you take home). A lot of folks here are pissing and moaning about what a nightmare it all is, but it really depends on the community you work in. Affluent kids are generally well behaved kids.

I quit a 20 year engineering job, entered a one year training program, and came out the other end certified in high school math and physics. Got a job in one of those affluent schools and have been there six years now, teaching math and physics. 

First year or so is very, very busy, as preparation takes much of your time. After that it eases off a bit, so that now I only work every other evening and only six or so hours on most Sundays. The work days are very busy, with ""breaks"" of dubious quality - you are  an adult in a building of kids which means there is no real relief from responsibility. Depending on your school you can usually get out by 4 in the afternoon, which is helpful for running errands, etc., though I still average a 9 hour work day.

Then.. vacations and holidays. :) They are awesome.

Oh yes: don't do it unless you like spending all your time with kids. There are a lot of kids in schools... "
highschoolteachers,"I've been in six different high schools during my teacher education program. Every school had a 20-25 minute lunch and, if they had a break, it was a 10 minute morning break or a 20-25 minute study hall. All in all, 20-50 minutes of ""break."" "
highschoolteachers,"I had pink eye multiple times in middle/high school - they are absolutely right; once you start on drops, you're good. However, I was always forced to stay home the first day on drops (which was good, because I invariably would end up with pink eye in both eyes!) because my mom didn't want me to chance it."
highschoolteachers,"The BLS's Occupational Outlook Handbook is also great if you want to get kids thinking about what they want to do once they leave school. I remember being required to browse through it in my junior year and it was eye-opening: the salary difference between a high school diploma and a college education, as well as the types of jobs available, was mind-boggling to me. I credit it as part of my motivation for being the first person in my family to go to college. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm also a white woman teaching at an almost all black high school. I've had a few of my more difficult children call me racist, and I just laugh at them. Even some of my other students have been like, ""We're all black. What are you talking about?"""
highschoolteachers,"This student is at least a year behind in credits needed to graduate. This semester, he failed one class and got two other Ds, one C, and one A. 

I've contacted his mom a few times throughout the semester with updates on things he's doing well and things that he is not doing well with specific suggestions on what he can do to improve. She seems supportive/grateful for specific feedback that includes something positive that he has done in class since his track record in high school is not good. I don't think she has a ton of influence over the student, and a big part of me thinks that this student is just biding time until he can drop out since he's so behind on credits. "
highschoolteachers,"I always encourage high school students to bring their concerns to the teacher first. It's a good life principle that it's better to try to resolve situations first between the two people who are directly involved before escalating by bringing in outside authorities.

RESPECTFULLY bring your concerns to your teacher. Listen to what she has to say. Then, if you don't get the answer you're looking for, absolutely involve your parents. "
highschoolteachers,"My understanding is that a CSET is to get clearance to teach in a certain subject if your bachelor's degree doesn't do it for you. I was a philosophy major and CSETed in Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Earth Sciences and Health Science. So I could teach high school level history or bio classes etc. A CSET test is not the CBEST test. "

I'm reading Wonder aloud to my fifth graders at a conservative school and have to just censor a few things (talking about being flat chested, etc). Do I think they can handle it? Probably. Is it worth the headache for something minor that doesn't teach any valuable life lessons? No. If I were teaching high school and the language had a message or deeper meaning, I'd definitely fight to use it and start a discussion. It's just not the case at the lower level. "
highschoolteachers,"I sort of fell into it.

I was always one of those ""helpful"" students, both in my days in public school and in college, where I would often act as an unofficial TA for some of my professors; one even had me teach a couple of classes because I knew the program better than him!

I worked a lot of random jobs during and after college, and have two degrees in film/video (which only adds to the amount of random jobs, just within that industry alone). I ended up unemployed for a good while (no local films being done) and a friend of mine who worked at a local school district suggested I apply for a teachers aide position. I did, got the job, and worked with middle school and pre-K students. A year later I planned to move to upstate NY, and when preparing to do so it was suggested I look into a Children's Center in Rochester; got the job there, working with severe special needs students. Family health issues (my father) had me go back to my hometown, and after a few jobs within the course of the first year, I went back to the district and applied again, this time being assigned a position with the SDC English classes at the local high school, which is where I've worked since for the last several years.

As those years went on, it became apparent to the teacher I work with, the administration, the counselors...everyone...that I had a knack for teaching. Not just in English, but in any classroom I happened to be in.

Through them (and family and friends) encouraging me, I looked into steps toward getting my credentials. 10 years after getting by Bachelors, I'm now about to start my student teaching phase of getting my credentials, and I'm both intimidated and excited about the possibilities the future holds. I know full well the stress and demands and the darker side of what the profession has in store for me, but I also know all the good that can come of it."
highschoolteachers,"I think that's going to depend on each person,honestly. Each is going to have defenses, habits, capabilities, and struggles. Kudos to you for reaching out to them and having the heart to sustain meaningful connection.

I'm a parapro halfway through my fourth year at a high school in a program for at risk, and various things on their plate that make school difficult. 

Like I said, each student responds differently,but I can jot down some general tidbits that have been helpful for me to keep in mind as I've worked.

One thing that I think can be underestimated is just the sheer fact of providing normal, what a gift! From day one, telling them what to expect, and following through on it, no exceptions. One might think making flexible adjustments is more intuitive and helpful with this population but I have found that on the contrary, it teaches them you don't mean what you say and they don't have to put in the work unless they feel like it because you're going to bend over backwards to pick up the pieces. That is in fact a disservice. I think creating a space in their lives where there is limited ambiguity, rules and expectations with accountability tells them that what they do matters, facilitates an atmosphere where because they know what to expect, they're more likely to put their guard down. 

This is not warm and fuzzy and on the front end involves being exhaustively accused and perceived as some strict bitch with a stick up her ass ( how dare she tell me to stop rolling my eyes, how dare she tell me to get off my phone, how dare she tell me to get some work out).

However, without fail, this has nearly one hundred percent resulted in relationships where I'm respected, or at least the expectations are. I've had notoriously angry broken hurting students fight me tooth and nail about those kinds of habits, only later to set my heart in song by calmly shaking their heads half smiling, ""coaching"" other students in the room ""dude, stop arguing, she's going to take your headphones away"" or ""bro, she's just going to send you to the office if you keep talking like that"". I don't think there can be a greater gift for these people who have had their lives hunkered down in the panic of uncertainty to have a place where rules are understood, that protect them, and are consistent. Children need to be told no, that keeps them safe, teaches boundaries. Oftentimes the teens in these situations have not been taught that or have had things enforced with abuse of power at their expense. Modeling a structure and routine for them is a gift.

I think this is the best thing that can be done for them, regardless of whatever other materials are covered. Because this is how trust and respect is bred.
 Those confrontations are no piece of cake, but they can also be a chance to model disagreement and discipline without abuse, threat, and shouting. I always start by calmly affirming they have the right to believe or feel whatever it is they are expressing but that there are expectations for how to communicate respectfully, by choosing the right time, place and words. Failing any one of those invites consequences.  How we do business is just as important as the business itself. 

As for getting work done beyond the behavioral management piece,
first, emphasize the habits and not the material when they're sitting glaring at you in study hall wondering why they have to do a page of math homework or an essay or whatever. Instead of the abstract rabbit hole of trying to predict what information might later be applicable, I just cut to the chase and affirm they'd rather be doing something else, that it's confusing, but practicing doing things you don't want to do but have to do is so important for being a hard worker and later getting a job. Draw from other areas of their lives, like sports or activities that are demanding. Encourage them as people who are able to work through difficult things, that they can put effort into this and develop habits that will maybe make school more manageable but also for sure make them stronger adults. "
highschoolteachers,"I would think it depends on where you're teaching and what the requirements are for middle school.  Some states/districts, such as mine, require that sixth grade ELA students have a 2-period block of language arts, then 1 hour thereafter (7-12).  For me, I feel this makes my position easier than that of someone teaching high school - 1/2 as many students per day = 1/2 as many papers to grade/assessments to give.  I've only got two LA blocks per day, along with 1 elective, so...94 students per day vs. (potentially) 145 per day.  

While I do have few students, there is still plenty to read/evaluate.  Especially when we hit our argumentative unit in the beginning of the year, when the kids each choose a topic to research and write a persuasive/argumentative paper.  Over three months they're taught research techniques, opinion vs. fact, MLA formatting (because our district likes it that way), and rewriting skills.  So, I'll be reading 64 3-4 page research papers come March, then again when they do rewrites for better grades.  (No four-page papers?  Who told you that lie?)

In terms of workload - it all depends on how you choose to present the information and what you choose to grade (remember - you're the teacher.  You don't have to grade everything).  I do a log of projects, both group and individual, which saves a lot of time on the back end (grading while they work, etc).  If you can conform your units and lesson plans to work in your favor then you've already won.  

Parenting - well the wife and I are parents of four.  Only one was an infant when I began teaching, the others were already in grade/middle/high school.  However, my wife also worked - albeit part time - so we also had to work around that.  Yes, it's tough being away from the bambinos during the day.  Can you get some familial assistance with the kiddo?  Perhaps a trusted neighbor or friend who would be willing to step in for an hour/two after school while you stick around?  Even a day or two/week could give you that needed breathing room.  

Sounds to me like you've got some chops already and are confident in your abilities.  I feel that, whatever you decide, you're going to do just fine.  "
highschoolteachers,This is a good idea. My high school freshman have low reading levels and low motivation so maybe if I read to them it could help...I will have to look into this book. When did you have time to read to them?
highschoolteachers,"I could be wrong, but my understanding is that you cannot CSET your way into a credential anymore. The rules are changing along with the new California Standards. I could be wrong, but the people I've heard this from visited my high school to prepare us for the NGSS and we were told that there will be no allowances for CSET."
highschoolteachers,"I've taught elementary, middle, and high school. I've loved virtualy every class I've ever had, but I found I couldn't manage elementary and middle school as well once I had kids of my own. I just don't have the patience or self-control to be as ""on"" as I have to be all day with younger students and then come home and offer the same patience and attention to my own kids. I know a lot of people can teach middle school well with young kids of their own, but I couldn't  

I'd be happy to give you some tricks I picked up to balance family and school with babies if you'd like to pm me. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"If you haven't already, I'd talk to the department head or another high school English teacher. I know it's a busy time of the year with holidays, but you might be able to schedule a time to meet him or her for lunch and ask questions about the school and the students you'll have. 

If you want the students to use specific skills when watching films, you can practice them in the first few days with short films (look at shortfilmoftheweek.com for some that you could use after screening them) or with TED Talks. I used ""The Karman Line"" in my class. (It has a brief moment in which you can see a man's butt, and I just blacked out the screen using the a/v mute button on my smartboard moment). ""This Is Normal"" is also good. In  general, it's good to introduce solid procedures and practice them consistently from the first day, whether those are things like how students can ask to use the bathroom, where/how they turn in their work, or what skills they need to practice in your class. 

This teacher posted videos of his first few days of school. http://www.agapemanagement.org/ "
highschoolteachers,"1. How old are your students?
2. What do you teach?
3. How much autonomy do you have in the classroom?

As an ESL teacher who works with high school students (and has worked with middle school in the past) and who has dealt with personality conflicts among my students, I almost always prefer to organize desks into tables and divide students into small groups of four or so. Six is my preferred maximum. Each student had a desk name tag which I placed at their assigned seat before class began. I then adopted a task-based approach to classroom learning, so that each group has a task to accomplish within a preset time limit during class. (This is easier when you use some flipped classroom methods.) There's always a motivation for completing the task correctly during your time limit. I also randomly shuffled groups so that everyone was forced to work with different people every week. If and when they protested, we discussed that in adult life they would sometimes have to work with people they didn't get along that well with, and then we discussed strategies for compromise and conflict resolution. I had to be super hands-on with them all the time and it got exhausting, and it didn't work 100% of the time, but I did see improvements. For my middle-schoolers I also adopted a rule that for every mean, insulting, or rude thing that came out of your mouth, you had to say something nice. ""You have very organized freckles,"" was one memorable one. My mantra was, ""You don't have to like your classmates, but you do have to be polite to them."" Also, ""You don't have to say nice things, but you may not say mean things."" Eventually they began to get it and the classroom environment became much more civil.

For your students with interpersonal conflicts, I would take a quick moment to address it with the two of them and try to help them resolve it if you have the time to do so while other students are engaged in a task. If that's not feasible, perhaps one of them could ask another student to switch seats? But it shouldn't be without your supervision/permission."
highschoolteachers,"Well, I can definitely say you're not alone. That's exactly what happened to me in bio, chemistry and physics - the kids that don't have the academic skills to get it on their own will prefer to give up. I don't know if it's a generational thing or not. Some people have suggested gameifying it when possible. I think there might also be an element of ego preservation - they'd prefer not to feel stupid so they justify giving up as their way of blaming you or the subject for their lack of performance.

I've also noticed that MANY kids come in with fixed concepts of intelligence - you're either smart or stupid. They're hyper-aware of their own feelings to the exclusion of the things that will help them grow. For example, one of my classes has a strong split between independent achievers and struggling high-needs kids. The independent kids love to ask next-level questions, which I'll answer briefly, but I usually deflect them to coming in at lunch for a more detailed answer on their own level (they're usually asking things about quantum mechanics - this is a biology class). 

What the struggling kids take away from this brief exchange is not ""that was a 30 second comment in a 1 hour class"", or ""that kid sounds like he knows what he's talking about"" or ""I want to be able to ask questions like that too"". No, what they've told me is, ""all we do is sit while that kid brags about how smart he is"". 

What frustrates me the most is that these things have been embedded since at least middle school and they get sent to high school without coping skills ingrained."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school, I'd copy even if my friend's answers were wrong. 

"
highschoolteachers,"Calling some parents might help too. I teach high school, and I know that I have suddenly gotten more interest in work from even my seniors after I call their parents with concern that little Susie is not keeping up with her work because she misuses her time."
highschoolteachers,"First off, I can't even imagine how hard it must be for you, teaching, with an infant at home. I really don't know how teachers do it, and if I even decide to have kids, I don't think I would even be able to CONSIDER it without the reality of leaving teaching for at least the first year or two.

That said, I moved from MS to high school. A lot depends on the school, but I think high school is much easier overall. Yes, the grading can be cumbersome and intense, but the kids are also more independent, and they need less hand-holding than middle-schoolers. Grades also MATTER in high school, unlike in middle school, where kids get promoted regardless of if they pass or fail a class, and usually based on test scores.

I would recommend reevaluating your grading system or assigning fewer, but more meaningful assignments. Perhaps hire a student helper to grade some items for you (homework or multiple-choice items.) Also, don't be afraid to grade for completion when you can. I do this with some assignments, especially written responses, classwork and homework. Essay grading will always take some time, but perhaps you can assign an essay, have the students peer grade each others essays, and then just look over the work to make sure their grade is accurate? You can also do this, by crossing out the names of students, and assigning each a number, so that students don't know whose essay they are assessing. 

Something else you might consider is the added stress of changing schools and grade levels, while also parenting. I feel like it takes at least a full school year to get the hang of a new school, and while I am much happier teaching HS than I was at the middle school level, I am also having to re-build my curriculum resources from scratch, instead of using things I used last year, which is also time-consuming. 

Good luck with whatever you decide!"
highschoolteachers,"Well as a middle school teacher with 3 preps, I guess my input may not be accurate if the middle school teachers in your district have 1 prep.  Either way, middle school is exhausting.  Unless you are TOUGH AS NAILS, you need to be on top of them 100% of the time.  It's not like high school where you can trust them to do independent work, and go check your email.  You really need to be observing what they're doing all of the time.  It is definitely way more difficult in terms of classroom management, but easier in terms of planning because you are really teaching skills more than you are teaching content.  If you are tired from parenting, I would expect that HS would be easier, because middle school kids make me extremely tired.  I've taught every grade of MS, and each one is difficult in its own way.  I enjoy teaching them because they are at the verge of self awareness, but they have very little self control.  I am thinking of moving to HS because I am too tired from MS.  Either way, I wish you the best!  Teaching is tough enough without kids at home, you are doing great things!"
highschoolteachers,"I made the switch from HS to MS, but it was after only one year teaching HS. I've been teaching middle school for nine years now. 

One thing to keep in mind is that in HS, there are multiple paths for students, including advanced and remedial classes. If you're thinking of a middle school that doesn't do this (as I'm guessing from the reference to one prep), keep in mind that you may very well see that full range of ability in one classroom. On paper, it's one prep, but if you're differentiating for the multiple levels within the class, the planning could be fairly similar in terms of effort. Plus, middle school kids often need more variety in lesson structure and activity type to maintain interest.

That said, the essays do make a big difference. When I taught high school, I felt like I was constantly either grading essays or about to collect another round. In middle school, I can get their work back to them pretty quickly. "
highschoolteachers,"Okay, I want to say up front that if your only reason for switching is because you think it's easier, DON'T.

To address your comments: though the length of writing assignments might be shorter, I'd say middle school ELA has the kids writing more frequently. Now, assessing each piece isn't something I do, but I do try to read a lot of what they write. 

Next, not saying that you're doing this necessarily, but I hate it when people assume middle school is ""easier"" than high school because, honestly, teaching middle school well is very hard to do. 
As far as management goes, it's a whole different ball game for middle school. They're little adults one day and kindergarteners the next. In short, I would not make this switch with the assumption that it will be easier. If you have a true love for middle school students and a passion for teaching them how to love reading and writing, by all means, give it a go.  "
highschoolteachers,I did the opposite: moved from middle to high. One prep does not mean less grading. The classroom management side is very stressful. And the middleschoolers will pull at your heartstrings more than the high schoolers. I wouldn't make the switch because it's easier. You have to really want to be in middle school.
highschoolteachers,"[Flatland!!](http://www.flatlandthemovie.com/) You can download it here.

It's pretty cute and good for middle / early high school. I showed it to my 6th graders last year. IIRC, it's a perfect one period activity."
highschoolteachers,"Let them know from the very start that they MUST attend every session, unless they have a very, very good reason for missing class (i.e. NOT a GP/dentist appointment). There will inevitably be absences though, so contact the learners after every single absence. This takes forever because sometimes they don't answer their phones so you have to send messages across the college intranet, but then they don't read those either so you have to send an email. Then give them a grace period of 3 days to respond. After three days, take it further - see what disciplinary actions are available to you. Our college has compulsory catch-up classes for low attendance students as a warning, then an intervention meeting with someone from the management as a final warning. If their attendance doesn't improve after that (usually three consecutive weeks is the limit), then whoosh~ they're off the register.

As for late work, this is harder to track because the learners could be attending every session. You have to keep addressing them on their own, face to face and over email to confirm (so then you have a written record of the deadline). Most assignments will be automatically capped at the lowest possible pass mark when they're handed in late or incomplete, which acts as a deterrent, but sometimes some students can still succeed in the progression paths they chose even with the lowest mark. So, they need to be pestered about it like you're a debt collector. I currently have three students (out of about 120, so not so bad!) who are completing four assignments each over the two-week holiday break. Is it difficult? Of course it is. It's bloody stressful for them. But, these assignments are seven weeks late. They can deal with that crap themselves, I don't care. They brought it onto themselves. Obviously don't say that in an interview, though...! Your students need to understand the importance of time management, and they need to understand how to take responsibility for themselves and their own learning. It definitely isn't high school where you can give them so much more support and basically spoonfeed them the answers; they MUST do the assignments completely from scratch independently. So your focus is on cultivating independence and responsibility. Which is difficult. A lot of students will hate you at first when you keep not answering every question they ask, but they will eventually get the hang of it and start answering their own questions. One thing I find myself repeating often is, ""when you ask me that, I'm just going to Google it to find the answer, so why don't you Google it yourself?"""
highschoolteachers,"&gt;grades are no different than the silly achievements

I am so fucking sick of teachers and students treating grades like a carrot on a stick. Is this something that happened within the last two or three years? It sure as hell wasn't the case when I was in high school back in 2009.

You get graded on your tests, quizzes, and projects. It is a measurement of your progress in the class. It isn't a reward for anything, really, especially not doing some worksheet. It's a measurement. It's like saying your gallon of milk gets an A+ because it's a gallon, while a teaspoon gets a D because it's only a teaspoon. What the fuck does that even mean?"
highschoolteachers,"What do you suggest as far as dealing with attendance and punctuality issues? Also, what does the attitude tend to be about accepting any late work? We tend to coddle students a lot more in high school."
highschoolteachers,"Watch a movie and have them use similar shapes or some sort of scaling to calculate the size of something.

I remember doing something similar with barbie in high school to find that she was like 6'8'' with ginormous knockers."
highschoolteachers,We're on a 4-day week (high school) and my kids loved Finding Nemo today - our last day. 
highschoolteachers,"I personally wouldn't recommend this.  If the parents already sniff blood asking for help may make her look incompetent or unorganized.  My suggestion would be to keep plugging away, document everything, and mentally treat this classroom like your student teaching classroom.  The parents are pining for the old teacher and there is nothing she can do to pacify them.  Next year will be better.  This year is going to suck.

If she hasn't already maybe she can send home a daily ""news"" sheet.  My kid is in first grade and the teacher gets a quote from five or six kids about what they enjoyed for the day and then leaves one panel for a ""what we did"" and things parents can do to continue the learning.  I like looking at that each day.

Maybe call home about positive things the kids did in class.  Chat up the parents.

Just some thoughts.  I teach high school so I'm not real good with the parents thing."
highschoolteachers,"I had so many wonderful subs when I was in K-12.

My favorite sub was - or I should say is, she's still kicking! - is coming up on her 82nd birthday or something like that, and has been subbing in our district for over 30 years. She's subbed pretty much everything - she majored in consumer sciences, so she started off in sewing and knitting, but usually ends up in English and history classes. 

I distinctly remember learning about the dust bowl in my Modern American History class, but before we started our work she talked to us for a few minutes about being a preacher's daughter in Kansas during that time and taking in folks who would ride the rails to escape the dust, just giving them a hot meal and a place to stay for the night in return for some work. Every student in the class hung on to every word she said and we couldn't get over how amazing it was to meet somebody who had actually lived through that time. (She also talked about these stamp book she had in high school, where you would ""stamp out"" the dictators of World War II by covering their images with patriotic stamps. Hee.)

God, she was such a gem. Good substitutes are amazing."
highschoolteachers,"How cool! I can imagine that elementary students would LOVE this lesson, especially seeing and petting a real one. It sounds like you are passionate, and enjoy teaching! It also sounds like you've got quite a ""lesson plan"" there - maybe a teaching career is in your future!

Disclaimer: I'm still in college. But, I like to think I know a thing or two. 

Legally, the only thing I can personally think of would be bringing a chicken in - some schools might not allow it due to allergies. That will depend on the school (and they will tell you). I don't think there will be an issue with you being homeschooled - the school will check you in at the front office as a volunteer or visitor, most likely, and that will be that. 

For teaching, I would just be sure to keep your audience in mind. Your students will likely not know anything about the subject, so be thorough and explain EVERYTHING. Also be sure to engage your students and include them in some of the discussion (""how does this chicken look different than this one?"" And then discuss the difference in breed and personality). 

As far as advertising goes, I'd probably stay away from traditional advertising in newspapers and such. Seems a little sketchy, and probably indirect. I'd suggest emailing an elementary school principal or two near you, asking about it. No doubt they would absolutely love a high school student to come and do this. Many times, in public school, they have high schoolers come and be ""buddies"" with the elementary schoolers and act as mentors, so this situation will not be too unfamiliar. I would suggest only contacting one or two, as I would imagine they would be pretty likely to take you up on it and you don't want to risk overcrowding your schedule. 

I'm sure the principal will ask once they ""book"" you, so to say, but if they do not, be SURE to include a ""game plan"" for what will happen. Include any live animals - as mentioned before, this will need to be approved first. 

Hope all goes well! I am in rural Kansas, and I can not tell you how much my students would love a lesson like this! Keep up your hard work, and have fun with it!"
highschoolteachers,"I totally feel you. I went to a school where you were allowed six ""undocumented"" absences a semester--above that, you failed. And an ""undocumented"" absence didn't mean skipping--it meant if you were out sick, mom or dad called you in but you didn't have a doctor's note. This was public school.

The high school I worked at, kids could miss constantly with zero consequences. Actually, that's not true. If they skipped their consequence was to miss that class the next day. ?????

Drove me nuts. The amount of total BS that came before class time was unbelievable. "
highschoolteachers,"I work in further education, but I got the job without an interview. However, I know what is expected from me and what my management expects me to do, so hopefully it'll be useful to you to know too. Warning: this is going to be a LONG post!

One of the biggest (and probably most ignored) obstacles to overcome is to avoid patronising learners, especially with giving feedback. Most of them are adults and they can see through false praise easily so you have to be extra careful with your wording of your feedback to be positive, but setting appropriate targets in a friendly yet normal tone of voice, almost like you're talking to a coworker... But be careful to not completely tear down that teacher-student boundary.

After saying 'don't be patronising', I'm going to add, 'but that doesn't include stickers.' Eeeeeeveryone loves stickers, this is a fact. Smelly stickers that smell like jelly beans and Coca Cola - even better. Stickers, SMARTboard games, Kahoot, flashcards, board games... all that stuff from primary school that gets abandoned in a lot of subjects in high school is all good motivational stuff, so it's good to mention how you intend to motivate learners. Especially when a lot of them will be quite insecure from being out of education for years.

Another big obstacle is how to deal with behavioural issues. Even in voluntary subjects where the adult learner is free to get the HELL out of your face, they still remain and act like they're thirty-something year old mothers in a supermarket (""I want to speak to the manager!!""). Suspensions are rare, exclusions even more so. Telling a learner to stand outside the class doesn't really work. You kind of have to deal with everything in a conversational way, and pull learners aside for serious chats when required at the end rather than during the class. Nine times out of ten, the student will reveal to you some kind of deep, dark personal issues that are going on. This is completely normal and you have to deal with it and ask to refer them to counselling even though your thoughts are yelling, ""holy crap, how are you still alive?!"" By the way, pastoral issues such as progression routes, counselling, care, and so on, are doubly important. It's crucial the students feel that they can talk to you about anything because you're usually their first port of call... Not many students refer themselves to student services, and in college, many of them need that extra support.

You might also have an issue with attendance and retention, but that's mostly going to come from the management hitting you across the face with graphs of targets and stuff. So you might want to think of ways of retaining learners or keeping up attendance and punctuality. Absences are common, but that doesn't mean they can go unexplained.

Okay, I'm going to stop myself here! if you google 'FE college interview questions', there's a couple of resources with example questions, but those points that I mentioned are ones that I have to think about day in, day out, so they're likely to be brought up."
highschoolteachers,"My district uses eSchool, and (at least at the high school), we take attendance every period. I have no idea how the IT works for eSchool, but our state reporting is apparently ok. Every other IT aspect of eSchool is baffling though. For example, we spent about 3 weeks this year where the rows of grades didn't line up with the rows of student names. IT couldn't figure out why it happened so they couldn't fix it. oO That was an exceptionally frustrating 3 weeks... "
highschoolteachers,Depends on the school. I'm in a middle school that only takes attendance during homeroom. Last year I was in a high school where you took  attendance every class. 
highschoolteachers,"I am a high school math teacher and I always need pens, pencils, dry erase markers, loose leaf notebook paper, batteries for calculators, and white out. I also enjoy gift cards to Walmart or Amazon so I can buy things myself and Starbucks so when I have had a rough day or week I can unwind with soothing coffee."
highschoolteachers,"Yes! I'm still in high school, but I see this all the time. There are quite a few openly gay/lesbian/bi/etc students in my school and there is a club just for them, and I'm smack dab in the middle of the bible belt!"
highschoolteachers,"I like using names from children's cartoons. I started doing it when I taught high school &amp; my own daughters were little. Now I teach 7-9 and my own daughters are around the same age. Most kids love remembering Arthur, Buster, DW and Muffy. Or the stand by of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marg &amp; Maggie. For science related examples Pinky &amp; The Brain show up, as do Dot, Yacko &amp; Wacko. Characters from Cyberchase or even Dora the Expolorer get giggles. "
highschoolteachers,"No worries. I've been a test administrator as well. (I teach high school.) I don't really have any horror stories beyond the first day - that was just plain chaos. I have no hope for the test scores, however. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree; kids are very capable of some amazing things. I don't think it's fair to say they're not capable of thinking/planning just because they're kids. There's lots of adults who haven't acquired those skills! I teach high school, so my students are basically adults. Some of them plan and organize better than colleagues of mine. 

Just today, I subbed for another teacher during my prep period. She had no seating charts. None. No rosters, nothing. It was mind-boggling to me that she wouldn't have *something* for a sub to work with. She left a movie to show, but no equipment to show it on. She left a film guide, but it didn't match the movie. It was a planned absence and not even an emergency as far as anyone knew. We did the best we could -- watched the video, talked about it as a class, tried to make a lesson out of it. When the students in her class had me for class later in the day, they expressed frustration at the teacher's lack of preparation (on a daily basis, not merely today). I think they're more perceptive than a lot of people give teens credit for. Yea, they do some boneheaded things, but on the whole, they're still teachable. If they don't know how to handle chaos and abuse, as you mentioned, they can be taught to problem solve and cope (in safe, structured ways) before it's too late. I think most good teachers are doing that in some version or another, but we may all have different language and terminology to describe this type of methodology. I'm guessing a lot of teachers bristled at your description (probably ""abuse"" is a particular hot-button since all teachers are mandated reporters for CPS), but no one would disagree with the concept of preparing kids for the work world.

highschoolteachers,"It wasn't in a test, it was on the wall of a high school gym with sports accolades plastered everywhere. Apparently the girl holding the record for running the 400 was named ""Latylenol""."
highschoolteachers,"Back when I was a high school student, I was given a physics problem involving cows, one of whom was named Moolinda. It is still my favorite name on a worksheet to date."
highschoolteachers,"I hit on the idea of using Google Classroom as a way to give students a partially filled-out spreadsheet that they would enter their lab data in. It would graph it for them so that they could see the data quickly for making their conclusions off of it.


With conditional formatting, I make all the questions **to be answered in yellow**, and they turn **green when they are complete**. No more blank answers on a worksheet when it highlights exactly where the answers need to go.


With data validation, I can limit their choices for answers to make sure that they answer the basic question (like “increase, decrease, or stay the same” before moving onto an explanation. 


Wrapping questions with =if(isblank( statements allows me to hide future questions until they have completed previous ones. 


Of particular value to a science lab is to force them to make a hypothesis and have a question at the end ask them about their specific hypothesis (including the details they selected) using =concatenate statements.


On the prelab page, I was able to even check that they entered the correct answers with a few =if statements, and programmed the sheet to display a number of how many they had wrong, so I could quickly check computer screens to see that they had completed the prelab questions and had the basics correct before I let them in the lab. 


I’ve made some tutorial videos on each of these simple parts if you want to build your own sheet like this. The tutorial playlist can be found here:

I’ve been running a flipped classroom since the fall and this spreadsheet and activity has been the best thing I’ve done all year. The students (high school biology) figured it out really easily and the sheet guided them really well to inputting data and drawing conclusions from the graphs it generated. I had more students (high, low, and middle-level ability) understand the concepts of the lab than anything else I’ve ever done teaching."
highschoolteachers,"Now I'm starting to get it. I'm sort of disappointed in the downvotes you are getting. This is one of the more provocative and interesting discussions I've seen on this subreddit. I can see how and why people disagree with you, but that's beside the point.

I think the original post came across in a way that didn't reflect this tone, so it may have put people on the defensive. This post makes a lot of sense to me, especially your last line. I don't think many people would disagree with you. I've noticed growing concern in my own perceptions about how ready kids are for post-high school life. I am more of a believer in building kids up while building resilience. I think that takes some serious thinking. It's why I'm glad you posted this.

Alfie Kohn said we should treat kids with the same dignity with which we treat our friends. If we had a friend forget to bring an umbrella to our house and it starts to rain, we don't give them a lecture on remembering umbrellas and checking the weather, we loan them our umbrella or walk them out to their car.  They still make a note to themselves to consider that next time. I think treating kids with dignity can be important, too. I can see how you could be frustrated when a kid doesn't improve after the first time. It sounds like you do work with them over and over and are frustrated and looking for a better solution.

It's tough to prepare a kid of a bad boss. Is that possible to learn without going through it?





"
highschoolteachers,"This is probably going to sound insane, as so many teachers have the opposite issue, but my administration sometimes comes down *too hard* on kids. Being in such a small school (the one high school in the district has less than 60 kids) means that kids with behavior issues stick out like sore thumbs. At a bigger school, there's more of a rotating door; here, it's the same 4 or 5 kids getting in trouble all the time. Because of this, my administration tends to be inflexible and harsh with punishments come this time of year. I have to be careful how I word my concerns with my principal, as I don't want to cause my students more grief. 

I work hard to start every day as a clean slate for my students; even if you were a major jerk yesterday or really made me mad because you were off task, today is a bright, sun-shiney day where anything is possible. My administrators don't take the same approach. 

Example: I have a senior who is 100% checked out of high school. She's over it. She got herself into a bad situation last year involving a house party, and she came back this year with a huge chip on her shoulder. Just getting her to turn any assignments in is a struggle; she doesn't really do anything until her grade is at an F, then she does just enough late work to get up to a D. Her attitude is exhausting, but I work really hard to try to motivate her as best I can. We had a final paper due on Monday. She waited until the VERY LAST SECOND she could have turned it in (greatly compromising the quality of her essay because she rushed through her edits and refused to ask for help). I was expressing my frustration in the lounge that she would wait so long, and my principal overheard and encouraged me to give her a zero on this SUMMATIVE assignment (worth 200 points) because she didn't turn it in during my class period, when I told them that they just needed to turn it in my the end of the day. 

 I'm not that kind of teacher, I never will be, and it frustrates me that my admin upholds the standard that we *should* throw the book at some students, when what they really need is more support, not stricter consequences. "
highschoolteachers,"I was a substitute for five months in a city right after finishing my degree. Calls typically came anytime between 6:45am and 8:55am; yes, school here does start at 8:35 for elementary and 8:45 for high school. As my reliability became known, I did start getting the occasional call the night before and some teachers would request me for several days.

I will add that it is a cliche to say substituting is glorified babysitting, to a point that is true BUT that is not an excuse for not trying to use every day to find some small improvement in your teaching skills. My advice to any recent graduate going into teaching is look at every day as exercise for your teaching skills, days that go horribly will tell you about the kind of schools or grade levels you do not want to teach long term. Seek out teaching in your area(s) of specify but avoid saying no to anything you're offered, it'll all help you learn about your own teaching interests. I'm now teaching full time in my subject area, Visual Arts; as a substitute, I taught everything from high school physical education to kindergarten music."
highschoolteachers,"They will be. You don't make kids suffer to prepare them for suffering. They will find it well enough on their own. Just tell them about it in context, in advance. For example, I tell my grade 5 kids they may get their mark lowered when handing in assignments late, in high school. And I also tell them that they, and their peers, siblings, etc., when adolescents, may turn emotionally very negative toward parents, others, teachers, etc. Preparing kids does not mean forcing them into painful situations in preparation for other painful situations."
highschoolteachers,"I have two education degrees- well, I will in May! One is in elementary education and the other is in middle school high school science (life science for hs). It's been a hell of a lot of work- but I managed to fit it into 4 years. I did do 2 years of PSEO though, and I've taken 18+ credits every semester and summer classes. I think it's worth it- because I'm much more marketable- but there are days where I wish I only would have picked one! (Usually just days when im super lazy!)"
highschoolteachers,"Thanks this is really helpful!  I see you're working towards becoming a high school history teacher.  Same here!  As for subbing, do you tend to get called in more at the beginning and end of the week (Mondays and Fridays) or in the middle of the week?  There may not be a pattern at all, but I'm curious if there is.  "
highschoolteachers,"YUP! I sub, work another job, and go to classes (grad). I'm also getting paid about what you are, $80 a day here in VA.

Here's what I did.
Arrange your schedule to have entire school days off. Two days of the week I have class and I work my other job after class (flexible hours). The other three days are totally free during school hours. I then pick up hours at the other job or take classes after school hours.

I often don't know what my schedule is going to look like. I'll get a call either the night before or between 5-7am the day of. So a charged phone is a necessity. 

In terms of what you get offered- You never know if a better job will come later. I often err on the side of caution and take the first full day job I'm offered whether it's in my field of expertise or not. If a day is a half day I'm more likely to turn it down, (40 bucks is rarely worth it to me) If you want to actually make money you have to take the elementary school jobs. For every high school or middle school sub job there are like 3 elementary jobs per month. 

When it comes to half day jobs it's better to take beginning of the day ones instead of later in the day because sometimes you will be asked to stay the whole day and sub for a different class. Taking half day jobs is more common during the winter when school is canceled a lot and so you need to grab any job you can to pay bills. 

Don't expect to be hired every free day you have. When that happens just relish the ability to get chores done or relax to yourself. 

Any other questions? Happy to answer them!"
highschoolteachers,"You can find a new job or quit. Most kids in high school don't have that option. 

"
highschoolteachers,"I'm not trying to sound rude, but reading your comment I took your comment as much more ""holier than thou."" You basically made assumptions about other jobs they have had, and how they speak in the classroom with little to no evidence.  However, I do agree with your beliefs, but think with high schools it all depends on their situation as well.  Everyone knows the kids who should tons of potential but may not blossom professionally, or academically until a little after high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I completely agree. I'm a supplemental physics instructor at a public university and see the same thing happen with my students. Even when I ""spoon feed"" them certain material and ask if they are following they refuse to ask for help for fear of admitting they don't. 

I have also tutored math for quite some time, same problem.

Fear of making mistakes is something that needs to be eliminated in high school so students can come to class ready to ask questions and learn. Unfortunately there are teachers who would shut them down for showing weakness.

"
highschoolteachers,"You sound pretty sure about life outside of the educational system, which leads me to question, what exactly have you done other than teach? I've worked plenty of non-education jobs, never have I encountered a boss who didn't give me adequate time to mourn after bereavement.

I do agree that high schoolers should be held to higher standards and we need to end the cycle of ""pushing kids through"" but at lower grades they face enough challenges in their home lives and in school. Putting extra pressure on a middle schooler who has no support at home and possibly worse problems is a strategy doomed to failure.

Also, your ""holier than thou"" attitude is alarming - I don't know how you speak to your students but you write as if you're standing on a pedestal. "
highschoolteachers,"I couldn't agree more. I don't think the issue is kids not struggling enough, I think it's that we don't teach them to advocate for themselves and solve their own problems. I will go to bat for any kid that asks me to, but they need to put in the time on their own, not expect me to reach out every time or have mommy do it for them. 

I teach high school, fwiw. "
highschoolteachers,"Where I work, you have no expectation of privacy when using a school given machine. All of them run a special edition of Windows 7 Enterprise, so whatever goes on is recorded. And no, it is not possible to remove this edition of Windows. (However, their are some teachers issued macs, though windows is used for security purposes.)

Personally, I teach computer science to high school sophomores and I use my personal Macbook. MS office is not given, however, the department gives teachers a discount making the price $10. 

Edit: I also do not think you can just transfer windows from one machine to another. The windows key on the computer you get will be the **OEM** key. This is not transferrable. "
highschoolteachers,"As a person teaching at the college level I'm not convinced that offering a lot of outside class time support is part of the problem. No one comes to office hours. I am very accommodating about scheduling meetings with students. If I have a month with 1 student meeting that is above average. 

I think a bigger issue is teaching the skill of knowing when to ask for help. People avoid office hours because they are anxious to show that they don't know something. This is endlessly frustrating for me because I want them to be successful, but I can't chase down people individually. We need to help people understand how and when to access resources. College has options but you have to reach out to get them. The difference is that no one will force you to access that resource. 

Sometimes with people who were successful in high school part of the challenge in college is that now they need to ask for help for the first time or ask for more help than they are comfortable with. The content gets harder and people don't know how to adapt."
highschoolteachers,"I've got something written by the Dean at USC's School of Cinematic Arts for [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-harke/high-school-to-college-tr_b_628726.html).  He did a whole series of articles about the transition and difficulties of high school students transitioning into college freshmen.

Edit: Also SMU has this [comparison chart](http://www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/NeatStuffforNewStudents/HowIsCollegeDifferentfromHighSchool) between high school and college."
highschoolteachers,"Ah, the 'better get used to it' style of teaching. By that logic we should bully our three year olds to prepare them for school, load down our seven year olds with homework to prepare them for middle school and force our middle schoolers to pay for high school to be sure they are prepared for the financial burdens of college. Life will give our children challenges. We prepare them through teaching them to be balanced, caring, resilient individuals - not through constant hardship. In fact, children of adversity haven't been doing so well in our society, so perhaps it didn't prepare them for life all that well after all. "
highschoolteachers,"I encounter these problems with high school seniors - who in my opinion are no longer children. Yes they still lack significant life experiences but at this point they have theoretically already applied to and been accepted into college(s). I have had tremendous issues this year with my AP class complaining about too much work... If we consider them ""kids"" from pre-k till senior year when do you they have time to learn personal responsibility before college?"
highschoolteachers,"Totally. It's ridiculous. For some context, a parent of a kid in my high school challenged a bunch of books from our curriculum when I was in high school, one of which was because it was about a young boy who learns magic (Bless Me Ultima) because it was anti-Christian. Same parent challenged a book because it alluded to masturbation in half of one sentence. It's crazy how intensely restrictive some parents here want to be, to the detriment of their kids."
highschoolteachers,"I have two preps, but one is homeroom which barely counts. I teach ESL Reading at the high school level to newcomers and beginners, so I'm teaching Pre-K-5th grade content to 14-21 years olds. It can be...rough.

I have between 23-26 kids per class. ESL cap is legally 15. ::shrugs::"
highschoolteachers,They're in for a shock in high school where suddenly an F means no credit. 
highschoolteachers,"What grade level you teach should have some bearing on the type of support you offer, in my opinion. By the time a student is a junior or senior in high school, transitioning to a system that holds the student responsible for their own choices is not only ideal but necessary. This precludes the 'culture shock' that accompanies so many graduates. 

That is not to say the amount of support should be withdrawn, but I teach seniors, and at a certain point I am not going to help a student out if they're not willing to reach out to me. I'm not going to hunt them down if they missed assignments, or interrupt my lesson to tell them what they missed while absent, or throw in bonus points for haphazard work. I will go out of my way to ensure they can excel, but only through mutual cooperation. 

Many of my parents complain that I don't offer the opportunity to make up a '0' after the district-approved standard deduction period passes. My response is always the same: will a boss or college professor accept that excuse? "
highschoolteachers,"I think this is a really valid question. A trend that I've noticed in the last three years or so is that the students that are successful when they are in high school (specifically the one where I teach) are failing out of college in the first one or two semesters. My students generally go on to associate programs, for context.,

I remember talking to two of them about a year or so ago, and they both mentioned how while they were in high school, everything was warm and inviting and they got lots of extra help (teachers coming in hours before school starts / staying hours after school let out in order to offer tutoring), but when they got to college, that entire support system was gone. They eventually gave up because it felt like no one cared and no one was there to help them.

That conversation completely changed the way I viewed my classroom. I discovered that I wasn't teaching them how to seek help or get extra practice; I was creating a culture of dependency. 

At my school a teacher is expected to work before/after school to provide tutoring (which is an entirely different issue...) in order to make sure the students are mastering the material. While that gets them the diploma, is it causing more harm than good?
"
highschoolteachers,When I was in high school (about 5 years ago) we were allowed to have them but not in class. Usually would result in it taken away and given back after class unless student was rude or disruptive. I can't imagine being in a class when kids are on their phones. What state are you in? 
highschoolteachers,"I think the internet makes it a lot more difficult to shelter kids than it used to be. Adults who are less savvy (or perhaps just disinterested) in using the internet to seek out information than their kids can become much less worldly than their kids as a result.

I attended a Catholic high school in the mid-oughties. Our senior year, we had to take a morality class that involved a surprisingly liberal scope of discussion. For some reason, the word ""fuck"" was brought up.  Our middle aged, neoconservative teacher angrily stated that she hated the word ""because it's a horrible word for making love"". 

I wan't a hugely sexually active kid, but I remember thinking it was very strange that an adult could think that ""making love"" is the only kind of sex there was. I'd imagine some of my fellow students were thinking the same thing; they were dumbfounded. I think age and access to information via the internet contributed to this odd little information gap, and still does. 

That being said, I've worked in two developing world countries on two different continents that have lots of turmoil in their recent histories and I don't seem to have your problem. "
highschoolteachers,"A few things spring to mind: 

- A story about Puritans is too edgy for this parent. 
- This parent probably finds reading ""You whore!"" out loud titillating. So maturity-wise, this adult has not advanced beyond that of the high school students reading the play.  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach art at a Texas high school. In Texas, the limit is 22 students per teacher at the elementary level, but I don't think there's a state cap after grade 6. 

At my high school, my classes range in size from 20 (how the heck did that happen?) to 29. My worst-behaved class has 27. According to one counselor, my classes are ""capped"" at 28 due to the size of my classroom, and the other art teachers are capped at 31."
highschoolteachers,"Rarely, but it happens about once a month. However, I teach an elective, so that might just be because of my course. At my previous high school, it absolutely never happened, not once in 5 years! Different parent populations...

Are you concerned because you have a BUNCH of parents contacting you, or none? 

What are trying to do?"
highschoolteachers,"You're welcome!

Since it is a rural school, I would keep in contact with the other teachers here (which you're obviously looking to do since you reached out here) and work close with admin to make sure you cover the appropriate curriculum.

I do think a seating chart can help with rowdiness as you can make sure you separate easily distracted and restless students.

As for the other science teacher, high school never stops for some people :p"
highschoolteachers,"I have a more unique situation, I work in a small rural high school. I have 6 preps- all 4 levels of HS, Yearbook and an elective novel studies class. 

My smallest class is my elective, which has 5 students (YB also has 5 students). My smallest core class is 10, I would say my average class size for my English classes is 12 kids. 

My anecdotal evidence is not helpful, because I've experienced an insane amount of stress attempting to manage my preps. If my classes were this small and I had 1-2 preps, I could do some crazy differentiation. Where I'm at now, I'm not getting much done because I'm trying to throw together curriculum and get what feels like a million hours of grading finished every day."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school computer science. The average class size for my classes is 31, with the maximum being 34 students. Class size does not affect student performance, at least in the school I'm currently at. If I were in middle school or a school with lower performing students, I would prefer a smaller class. "
highschoolteachers,"Interesting. That policy is a bit strict for me. It is plausible for a student to late 3 times a semester because of an incident on the train. I imagine if that policy were to be in place at my high school, a lot of phone calls would be made. 
But thanks for the break suggestion. What I'm planning to do is marking down students who are late over 4 times or the chronically late ones. "
highschoolteachers,I wear running shoes 99% of the time with my black or gray or khaki pants and dress shirt. I am simultaneously better and worse dressed than those around me at high school. I have told admin before that if they want me to wear dress shoes I will but I will not be constantly moving around the room anymore.
highschoolteachers,"What level do you teach? I teach 7th graders (12-13 y/o) and they know that ""I was at my locker"" is not a good excuse. ""My locker was jammed"" is not a good excuse. ""I was talking to another teacher"" is not a good excuse unless it comes with a signed note. They know to get their butt to class. When I taught juniors and seniors, I allowed one, MAYBE two excuses like, ""the bus/train was late"" or ""my car stalled"" per year. Buses/trains are designed to run on a steady schedule; I realize they run late occasionally, but not enough that it becomes a recurring excuse. 

No matter what age you teach, but especially if it is high school, it is a disservice to them to train them to show up to school or work late. Their future bosses will not put up with b.s. excuses, so neither should you.

Our current tardy policy is one = a warning, two = a lunch detention, three = phone call home and a lunch detention, and four = a referral. This resets at the end of the trimester.

If I were you, I would use a natural break (spring break, end of trimester/semester, etc.) to announce a reset for your class. Use this time to go over all classroom expectations, then end with an emphasis on tardiness. Set your rules, make the consequences expensive, and don't waver. When a student comes in late, deliver the consequence immediately. If they realize you are serious, they will take their tardiness seriously as well."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Unfortunately, my resources are mostly for biology, so I can't send anything along, but make sure to check SMARTexchange (especially if you have an interactive white board).  Also, Chemistry Crash Course is a great series of videos on youtube.  They go sort of fast, but the guy is usually funny.

Alright. I'll give it a look. For the most part, I'm not so worried about the chemistry part as I did a lot of tutoring (both high school and college) when I was in school. My biggest problem is just figuring out where to start.

&gt;If you have computer carts available at the school, use them.  I don't know any chemistry sites off the top of my head, but I'm sure you can find some.  Interactive labs, possibly.  phet.colorado.edu has some cool interactive simulations, and I just checked and there is a lot of chemistry stuff there.

Interactive labs/simulations are an amazing idea. The students are all given personal laptops, so we should be able to do it all together. 

&gt;Good luck!

Thanks so much for the advice. 
"
highschoolteachers,"Well, this is a very rural Illinois high school. We actually don't have departments."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Try to get a hold of the other science teachers in the building and district to see what they can help you with. Science is a core subject, so there should be a set curriculum that you can work from. 

I'm having issues with this. It sounds as though the school has been through 3 science teachers in 3 years. The only other science teacher (biology) said that they're pretty much thrown in and told to ""teach them something"". I'll keep asking around though.

&gt;In the mean time set some strict guidelines for behavior, and get the kids into a routine they probably haven't had with the other teacher.

Great idea. I've noticed that it's difficult to get the students to listen to me (they're high school and I'm only 22), so it's probably not a bad idea to kay down rules early. 

&gt;While I'm waiting to get more info, I'd have them go through a newspaper and find a science article that interests them, and have groups do a research project and explain the science to the rest of the class.

Hopefully something like this can keep them busy long enough for me to figure some sort of lesson plan out for them.

Thanks so much for the tips. "
highschoolteachers,"That's wonderful!  I was thinking the other day that schools should have a one-semester ""life skills"" class that teaches personal finance and perhaps cooking/handyman skills.  I know that my high school had none of these things offered.  I went to school in a very affluent town and I guess they assume the parents are teaching their children how to manage finances.  
We have volunteers that come in to go over finances with the families at our school.  Many don't have bank accounts because they are recent immigrants and don't trust banking (based on experience in their previous country of residence).  The kids are growing up with a very skewed sense of finances, and classes like this are essential for their becoming successful after school."
highschoolteachers,"It's hard to understand all of the negatives without being in the shoe of a teacher. I was involved in education for quite a few years prior to being a classroom teacher and I thought I understood the in's and out's of being a teacher before becoming one. I was prepared more than most new teachers that come out of the credentialing program. Even with that preparation, I was still blind sided by how much work it took to being a teacher.


Your post reminds me of me because you mentioned how you looked forward to coming to work. I remember when I was a teacher's aide I would hate holidays because I couldn't work. I really enjoyed the interaction I had with the children and other staff members. Once I became a teacher, I realized I had to tone down that interaction. As a TA, I could be their friend more than their teacher. As a teacher, I had to be more like a parent. On top of that, your number one priority is to teach the curriculum so there isn't a whole lot of time to enjoy your students. I think that's one of the worst things. Right now I teach high school since I couldn't get a job teaching elementary. I feel like my classroom is a factory. Kids come in, I teach them, and they leave. There really is almost no time to talk to your students on a personal level. So when the opportunity arises, like they come by for lunch, you are really surprised to find out things about them. The best way analog I can think of is interacting with someone online. It's hard to see their personality. But when you finally meet them face to face, it makes the other person seem more human. That's what it feels like as a teacher sometimes. You have no time to interact with your students to get to know them and when there is that slight moment you do, you're like ""wow"". That's what I missed the most from being a TA. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree! I've been teaching high school for 23 years, the first 13 in urban schools and the last 10 in an ""alternative"" school, so I know what you're facing. I tell all new teachers that the single most effective classroom management strategy you can have is a day full of good lessons. You have to keep them super busy and you have to manage transitions between activities effectively. I keep a classroom timer going nearly all day to keep us on track. It's very structured, but the kids actually appreciate that. Some of them only get structure at school, and it's a natural thing for most humans to crave. Don't worry about your lesson being ""fun""; worry about it being meaningful and important. Fun is great if you can get that in there, too, but don't make that a priority."
highschoolteachers,"Don't worry, my high school students were doing the same thing on Friday! Friday's are already a crapshoot as far as student behavior goes but especially since things are starting to warm-up and spring break (for me at least) is just around the corner. I agree with Tport17, make sure your planning is on point and do everything you can to make sure engagement is high. Also, understand what things are in your control. Sometimes, things happen and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. I'm sure the administrators aren't holding you responsible for that outburst last week. Keep fighting and working hard!"
highschoolteachers,"I actually did not learn things like personal finance when I went to high school, but the Title 1 inner city school I teach at has a whole class on personal finance. It's a graduation requirement actually."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English and history, and my weighting is fairly simple: 50% tests and quizzes, 30% classwork and homework, and 20% writing assignments and projects. On top of that, I give my students a blank 50 point classwork grade at the start of the grading period, from which they get points deducted for inappropriate behaviors and lack of preparedness  (e.g. didn't do homework, profanity, playing with their phones in class, etc.)"
highschoolteachers,"I'm with you. I teach chemistry and it's important for my students to do homework for the exact reasons the other teachers here say they don't give homework. We need our students to go home and determine where in the problem they're struggling. I think our high school students are more capable of understanding why they aren't able to answer something, while an ES student would likely just be confused and frustrated.

There definitely isn't a right or wrong answer here."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school math teacher and hate giving homework. My assignments are due by the end of class unless they have an IEP. The kids that understand it and are good with returning problems don't need it and the kids that don't understand either cheat,don't do it out of frustration, or get it wrong because they can't ask for help. I need to see them do the work to get the credit. I do give them a few major projects during the grading period for them to work on when they are done with work in class or at home. "
highschoolteachers,"I always set a grade minimum on major, major assignments. Completion tasks are graded as is, but an essay that's worth 30% of their grade I don't let them score lower than a 50% on.

It's worth noting that because I teach high school, I don't tell my kids this until AFTER I've graded the assignment. And to be honest, most of them forget that I do this by the next time around. I do this because 1)50% is an easier hole to climb out of than 30%, and 2) If a kid turned in an assignment on time and TRIED, they deserve at least a 50%."
highschoolteachers,"I am at a place where I fight for my kids and lose my job. Any employee who pushes for a 504 is threatened with their job. The thing is, they are very careful that all of this is verbal so that there is nothing in writing.  

This is just the tip of what is going on. Our dyslexic kids will not be allowed to have any help (extra time, reading strips etc) once they enter high school. They need the 504 to guarantee that they will be successful. We are trying to get parents but they have been given the ""We are working on the paperwork"" line and ""It is being handled by _______ at the moment"" line or the ""Your child does not qualify"" line (even when we all see they do). The parents have given up. I am banking on one parent who may be able to see past it all and push and the transfer kids who got the 504 taken away. Also, due to who knows what, the dyslexic specialist has been told that the district will not longer formally identify dyslexic students. Media will cause the district to come back directly on all the teachers of that student.  

I want to leave before stuff hits the fan, but then who will be there for the kids? "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a first year high school teacher. Last semester I had a similar problem. After a month or so of trying everything I could think of, I finally talked to the principal and had him taken out of my class. "
highschoolteachers,"As a special ed teacher, all of the students on my caseload have to do a transition plan, which focuses on what they will do after high school, specifically for a job.  We start them as freshmen with career inventories, align their courses to their interests, and move them into internships and on-the-job training.  The counselors liked some of the resources so much that they are now implementing it in general ed.  So, it's possible on an individual level even though it's an incredibly broad focus when you consider the student body as a whole.  

Otherwise, yes, right on. Identify the problem, find the solution. The purpose of education is to make the teacher obsolete. He sounds whiny that he has to think for himself and figure things out instead of having it spoon-fed to him. Maybe that is just a cranky, end-of-the-week assessment on my part though..."
highschoolteachers,"I am not an elementary school teacher, but a middle-high school teacher, but it seems to me you may have found your passion in life. Follow it.  Kids need adults who love them and are passionate about teaching.  Plus, you are male, a positive in the life of so many kids who lack a strong, positive male role model.  It is not easy, but nothing worth well ever is...go for it!
"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, and I think it's important for students to be kept accountable for work done outside of the classroom. That said, my kids seem to go home with tons of homework and are involved in a lot of extra activities. They're teenagers and should be able to have fun. The compromise I have found is I give out my homework for the week on Monday and collect it on Friday. That way if they are busy a few nights a week they don't need to stress too much, but it still needs to get done and there is still a deadline, and I don't take it late. I like how that's been going and my students have expressed appreciation having the week to pace it out on their own terms."
highschoolteachers,"While I was studying I spent some time doing before and after school care. There are great days and not so great days. One day that particularly stands out in my mind is when a grade 1 girl came to me in tears because her friend from pre-school didn't want to play with her any more because her friends new friends didn't like her. 

It was really hard to watch her world view come crumbling down. I think it was especially hard for me because I don't have brothers or sisters and I was the youngest in my extended family so I never really had to watch another adult help 'fix' these kinds of things. 

This day stands out for me because a few years later she became one of my students at high school. It was nice to know that she overcame the social challenges of grade 1 relatively intact. "
highschoolteachers,"One of the best teachers I never had was a male elementary school teacher. Even though he wasn't *my* teacher, he would always say hi to me in the halls and during recess. He was a staple in our school; every student knew him, he knew every student.
 
Teaching is incredibly time consuming, but it's worth it. One of the hardest parts about elementary school, I would say, is that if you have a particularly rough group or just a particularly rough kid, you have them all day all year, as opposed to middle school and high school when the kids leave after an hour or so.
  
The flip side to that, though, is that by having the kids all day, you get to know them better and get to really see where they shine. And seeing that is one of the biggest rewards as a teacher."
highschoolteachers,Ours starts in Easter. I'm a first year teacher. Bought a house to accept a position teaching in my subject area that required me to move. I'm teaching middle years and high school. The year started out okay but it's been increasingly tough with middle years students choosing to behave inappropriately for their own amusement. I've been saving very carefully and will be spending my Easter week off in New York.
highschoolteachers,"I cannot speak to the education in Great Britain, but over half of the things he complains about I got going through public education:

-He complains about not knowing the law, how to vote, how public policy and current events are dealt not dealt with.  All of this I discussed in my civics class.  

-He complains about not knowing about taxes, how much it would cost to live alone or as a family and how much it costs to have a child.  This I learned in economics.

-He complains a lot about being told more about how to take care of a child, yourself, and general health.  This in general I was taught in a class that was labeled ""Social Psychology,"" which was Sex Ed meets common challenges for teens/young adults.  I know this specifically varies more dramatically from school to school and how it is implemented or even tolerated from state to state in the United States, so I won't begrudge him so much about that.  I also got quite a bit of this education in Biology not only in high school but at the middle school level.

The majority of his complaints though I don't accept because they are supposed to be requirements for graduating high school in the first place.  In a [subsequent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIu7pE0lBA&amp;) he tackles basically what I have said above- that I got this information and education, but that many do not.  He also clarifies that he wants the wasteful subjects, not the kids, out of school.  My response to that is that perhaps it is on us collectively, the teachers, to make sure that those are being provided and discussed in the classrooms on a regular basis.  

Now the other basic premise and complaint that he has is that much of the information that he learned was not only useless but pointless, ranging in topic from higher level Math, Science, History, to English.  This is a far broader and more interesting and important question to ask.  

In the United States the system we currently have is one based upon having a general education attempting to give students proficiency and development in multiple subjects, allowing for the decision for life careers and goals to happen following secondary education, as they transition into higher education, or while in higher education itself.  Therefore, secondary education also in the United States is geared and focused toward sending people to higher education.  

Many other countries have students and pupils make that decision sooner, and therefore allow their students to focus and select their specific learning earlier.  If in the United States we were to do as he proposes, there would have to be a serious redesign of not only secondary education, but the transition to higher education.  

I tend to like the idea and model that we have in the United States about general education and trying to give students multiple fields that they should be proficient, not just introduced to, because it allows for more opportunities should the one idea you wanted to focus on not work out in the future for you.  Also, it is important to have a general understanding of how the world works around you.  In my opinion, that stretches to the political, social, physical, biological worlds.  The subjects of history, math, and science give the knowledge necessary to have informed opinions about politics and current events.  It allows for students to look at the world around them not only with what they would only know if they followed their passions, but the general context surrounding such a question.  "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I learned early on that I wasn't teaching subjects, I was teaching students.

When I was doing my observations at my old high school, one of my old math teachers said exactly that.  It does not matter what subject you are in charge of, you are guiding and helping students."
highschoolteachers,"Well (most) adults have the ability to focus on work for 6-8 hours at a time.  Younger students can't and shouldn't be working that hard for that long, so homework has a function as spreading the work out over a longer period of time.  

Parents who are involved in the homework process will also be able to keep up with what their students are studying so they can reinforce those skills, as well as gauge how well their students are progressing.  If you know your child struggles with writing assignments every night it won't be a surprise when the teacher brings it up at conferences.  If you weren't doing that homework, how often do you have your child write or do math?  Would you have any idea of their current abilities?

In secondary school it starts to develop the self-discipline of doing work while not being directly supervised by a teacher, as it will be in college and most of the the rest of their life.  The work must be simple at first and get progressively more and more complex until students can plan and complete entire tasks independently.  Otherwise they'll be in for a bad shock when they leave high school and there is no adult standing over them to keep them organized and on task.

That being said I have seen plenty of teachers assign homework that is inappropriate in length, difficulty or relevancy.  That doesn't mean we need to get rid of homework, but maybe start the conversation at your site about the goal of homework and how you can assign work that meets those goals."
highschoolteachers,"That's a good point. Seniority has some play but definitely not all of the time. I've seen senior teachers get shifted against their will. At the high school level, it seems to be by favoritism because it's not enrollment. We're talking about basic classes that has to exist like algebra and geometry so it's not a matter of enrollment. I think it's unfair and is more detrimental than any benefits that may come from it. "
highschoolteachers,"Solid pedagogy is solid for any grade level. After several years of teaching high school, I was adequately prepared to dive right into middle school -- the only truly major difference was content. "
highschoolteachers,"This reflects my experience in a small, rural high school. My students are painfully below grade level and the culture of our area doesn't value education, specifically, doesn't value English. If you polled the parents in my district, most would probably tell you that their students shouldn't have to take 4 years of ELA because they're going to work on the farm, so it's useless. It's really hard to combat that attitude, and it makes it difficult to get students to buy-in when they have no incentive outside the walls of my room.

I love my job, and if I did my life over again, I wouldn't change a thing, but I did feel very frustrated my first month while trying to adjust to this school. I had to lower my expectations in the sense that my students *couldn't* write on grade level, so I had to start expecting them to write at an 8th grade level and then work up from there. It takes some serious pushing and pulling to have the kind of high-level discussions that I want to have. But it's worth it when you get there, when you can push (or, in my case, often *drag*) students to that higher level. "
highschoolteachers,"It depends on the path that you take.  I started in a large school with a high ESL population.  I really liked the job and the students but it was a lot of work.  There will always be the really bright students who want you to push them.  

I went on to a special program for gifted high school students.  The students were great but the work was really challenging. 

Now I teach at a learning centre for high school seniors and young adults. I offer all of the courses online with lots of face to face support. It is a dream job but the hours can be a bit weird for some people. 

To do all of this, I had to be willing to seize opportunities and to get extra training. It is worth it though. "
highschoolteachers,"Meh, it depends on the school and culture.  
Mine usually goes through the young and pretty teachers faster than a virgin goes through a box of tissues but I have friends at other high schools who started there fresh out of college who have been there for four years and plan on staying because of the good kids, parents and strong culture and expectations of the school.

You should also know that English teachers are VERY numerous for a relatively low number of positions so if you're going to get into a great school, you should either make yourself stand out, know somebody, have very good recommendations or all the above."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah I'd like to hear some examples, too.  I teach high school French.  I've been wanting to offer choices for projects and homework assignments, where a student would complete x out of y options.

Could you share some assignment examples, say from a Spanish year 1 or 2?"
highschoolteachers,"Sadly, I can only give you one upvote. I was just having this conversation with a co-worker today. From kindergarten until 8th grade, we just pass kids along. They don't have to actually do much of anything, and we'll just move them to the next grade. Then, all of a sudden, the rules change. Now, they're expected to do work. Now, they're expected to pass their state tests. But, they think everybody is just kidding. I mean, their teachers threatened them with retention in the primary grades and nothing happened. Nothing is going to happen to them in high school either. Then, they're 17 years old and still considered a high school freshman. This happens because they never learned how to work for anything. It's always just been handed to them. 

And, the pickle on the crap sandwich for me is that my teammates and I (middle school) are being told that we're the most negative teachers in the school because we are looking for ways to encourage/force our student to be accountable. "
highschoolteachers,"You're right that students in high school are not always mature enough to handle these expectations.

However, they don't develop maturity by being treated like elementary students where you get an A for effort.

The fact that they are used to having answers and grades handed to them is exactly why I do not give points for participating - I give points for answers. They need to learn to think. They need to learn to problem solve.

On a related note, my students contributed to their own grading rubric outlining what kind of work quality gets As, Bs, etc., so they have forfeited all rights to complaining when they get a grade they don't like. (Next year, I'm going to be implementing collaborative grading where they grade their own work before I do, so they will be responsible not only for the work but also for justifying the letter grade.) A student in my class who does exactly what they are supposed to do on homework, projects, etc., gets a flat 80%. That means if they want an A they have to develop their understanding beyond what is outlines explicitly in the course description and the learning targets. "
highschoolteachers,"In my experience, 7 really depends on the school. I worked in two different schools. One of the schools was a small high school in a farming community. The principle didn't even dress up. So I was comfortable wearing jeans and a nice shirt with sneakers. The other wasn't exactly formal, wearing a tie would make you seem out of place, but most teachers wore polo shirts and khakis with nice shoes. Don't get to hung up on this though. Most schools will be upfront about their expectations of proper attire. The manner in which you perform your duties will be more important to most administrators, especially since their is a huge demand for substitutes and the supply is somewhat low. "
highschoolteachers,"""The most important benefit is that they are cheap.""
Incorrect.  It costs Oklahoma nearly  7 million dollars a year to test just the high school students.  To give every high school student an ACT test per year would cost about 1.6 million.  https://mobile.twitter.com/joy4ok/status/564639342375600130,  Joy Hofmeister is the OK state superintendent.

&gt;

&gt;The __Finnish Matriculation Examination__ ([Finnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language) *ylioppilastutkinto*, [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language) *studentexamen*) is [the examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation_examination) taken at the end of [Secondary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education) to qualify for entry into [University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University). The test also constitutes the high school's final exam(s), in other words it is a high school graduation exam. Since 1919, the test has been arranged by a national body, the Matriculation Examination Board. Before that, the administration of the test was the responsibility of the [University of Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Helsinki).

&gt;Under former law, successful completion entitled one to enroll as a university student (hence ""[matriculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation)""). Although the legal requirement has been lifted, matriculation without completing the test is still an exception. The universities are now free to arrange their own entrance examinations in addition to considering scores from the matriculation examination. Thus, universities accept students based on the entrance exam points, the matriculation exam points, and also a combined score of these two. Successfully passing the test entitles one to wear the Finnish [student cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_cap).

highschoolteachers,"Procon.org has a page dedicated to this issue.  
http://standardizedtests.procon.org

The general argument laid down is that standardized tests increase student performance.  There are a few studies listed on the website that seem to suggest this. If I remember correctly NCLB was built around the education reforms made by Bush in Texas.  His reforms, which were similar to NCLB, showed an increase in student performance when implemented.  However, a lot of people have pointed out that the narrowed curriculum and potential teacher or admin cheating on exams probably skewed the results of the Texas program.  

Finland uses a end of high school standardized exam.  More info can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation_exam_(Finland). A lot of advocates of standardized exams point to this as being part of their success.  Critics point out that this exam is only used to determine entry into university and the questions tend to be broad and opened ended rather than the focused content that we use.  In general I agree with SeniorWeird's comment that I don't think their is a lot of good evidence for them.  The evidence I have seen has usually been refuted by other researchers or is often times taken out of context.  "
highschoolteachers,"You might not care about what the kids had for lunch, but they want to tell you. And this isn't limited to middle school kids. I've taught middle school and high school, and both groups want to tell you about their lives and hear about yours. That's a way that they will bond with you. The aspects might change--high school kids will tell you about their part time jobs, while middle school kids talk about their new sibling--but most students want to know that their teachers care about them. And they usually work better for teachers who care about them. 

You don't have to take class time to do this, either. You can talk to them in the hallway between classes, during home room, etc. if you have two minutes left at the end of the period, you could do a quick end of the class activity when kids talk about their weekends. Stuff like that. Go to a sporting event or the play. Let them see you outside the classroom.

Teachers who care about their students as people tend to be the most effective. If getting to know them doesn't interest you at all, I'm not sure how successful you're going to be. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes and no...the specific example of the letter was for 6th but all the other advice about establishing who you are with them still is applicable at the high school level. 

For example, a high school teacher I know has a policy of wiping out all extra credit and hall pass access if he gets a bad report from the sub. The kids care.

High school students will just test you more, but I think you'll find that although it wasn't that long ago for you (assuming you're a straight from hs to college now graduate) their maturity level is minimal and you might find yourself adjusting expectations quickly.

I also strongly agree with the post below about dress. Their brains are quick to jump from ""authority figure"" to""buddy"" if you don't look the part, plus it helps establish professionalism for future employment/networking (even if the other teachers wear jeans, avoid them until you establish yourself at least)"
highschoolteachers,"Current social studies (US History teacher) and gifted education professional...

Pretest students as much as possible and look into curriculum compacting (University of Connecticut). Pretest, because at least in two states I've taught in (IA &amp; CO), high school US history is Reconstruction through present, earlier stuff in 8th grade. Many may already have some background knowledge. 

If you can, or have time, consider creating proficiency level descriptors for your state standards. I.e. what is proficient vs. advanced for a given standard? If a student believes they can demonstrate proficiency on Standard A to you consider something like contractual learning with the student(s). Also go through and determine priority vs. supporting standards, see: http://bit.ly/2hw0AI1

If you have access to technology rely on it heavily, there are a lot of good background knowledge resources out there for history. Does your school have a learning management system? I.e. Blackboard, Moodle, Schoology etc.

Hope this helps!

"
highschoolteachers,"Based on the test comments, I take it you're in Texas?

I don't have any easy answers -- our early college high school teaches all of Biology (tested) from Sept-Dec and I'm not sure how she does it! But one thing you can do is distributed review. Review old and new material frequently and try your best to use data to target the review. So if a kid is getting one thing, don't make him or her waste time reviewing it, let them spend that time reviewing the other stuff. Since your timeline is so tight, you're really going to have to trim the content to teach to the test as much as you can. Do you use the Lead4ward document with all the STAAR questions separated and matched to the standards they test?

Good luck -- it doesn't sound fun."
highschoolteachers,"Ohio here. I'm also a TESOL certified teacher. Got both my masters in TESOL K-12 and masters art of teaching for English but that's only for 7-12. So my guess it's state dependent but most elementary people are self-contained so you wouldn't be qualified to teach K-5 English (which isn't even a separate subject in elementary in Ohio, only in middle and high school) without more endorsements. "
highschoolteachers,"I could wear jeans and sneakers five days a week at my east coast, New England public high school. "
highschoolteachers,"This won't help, but as a yearlong sub teacher in France, this is my life every summer. Currently I know that I will be teaching high school next school year (starting on September 4), but I don't know what grade levels I will have (it can range from 2 to 5 preps) and I won't know until the school reopens after break, around August 20. 
And I'm not even the worst-off! My year of student teaching, I learnt my classed only a week before school started. 
I can be pissed off all I want, things aren't going to change for me, so I take it slowly and I enjoy my summer break while I can, because I know my days are going to be full once I know who I'm going to teach!"
highschoolteachers,"At the school I'm at, all the teachers have four preps.  It's because it is a small alternative high school with only seven teachers."
highschoolteachers,Isn't 4 preps fairly standard?  I've never had less.  I've also rarely ever had my own classroom since I started teaching high school- though I did when I taught middle school.   I keep an extra set of materials in each classroom and I bought a backpack to lug around everything else.
highschoolteachers,"That's frustrating. 

Though, IME, that could happen at private, charter, or public schools and it could also be well-managed at any kind of school (except that I suppose it'd be hard to find an elite preparatory school that manages to remain elite and appease parents without stronger organization, but most private schools aren't elite prep schools). I've spoken with teachers who had your experience with all kinds of schools. It's not really about public vs. private, as much as it's a school vs. school thing. My public school has had the Master done since late May and hardly anyone has had any changes (some people had a change to the number of each prep, like they still have 11th Honors and 12th Standard English, but instead of 4 and 2, it's 3 and 3 with enrollment changes) and all changes are communicated when they happen over the summer.

My students will change slightly as they level classes and deal with late registration over the last weeks of summer, but they are already loaded in to my gradebook, and we won't start for a few weeks. I already have their test data. At the same time, in my district, there are many high schools that are still formatting their Master schedules. It just depends on the administration. It's not a bureaucratic issue in most cases (unless they're literally waiting on a zoning call or something). It's a principal issue and shows disorganized administration. 

Sadly, that doesn't bode well for other organizational and administrative competency throughout the year. The worst thing isn't even that you can't prepare, but that you seem to have a new administration who doesn't value preparation and thus will be unprepared for other things as well. "
highschoolteachers,"Lillame is right that teaching is less about native proficiency and more about your skills as a teacher.  The most important thing to think about now is what kind of a career you want.  Are you looking to teach in the states or abroad?  What levels would you like to teach? kindergarten, elementary, university, etc.?  If you want to teach kindergarten - high school in the states, a bachelors degree with teaching certification would be fine for you.  If you want to teach university in the states or abroad, a masters would be better.  I started my career with a bachelor's in Computer Science and went to Asia where they'll higher anyone with a bachelors degree and the right passport.  Then, when I decided I liked teaching, I got the masters so I could have more opportunities.    "
highschoolteachers,"Good luck! Check to see if the rooms are on the same floor. If so that makes it easier.  
  
I was a floating art teacher at a high school for 4 years.  
  
Interestingly, I don't have any pictures of my cart. =/ Floating is the most manageable when you have an office or storage space. Having a closet or storage allows you to organize supplies into buckets for easy pull-out.  
I used a 3-level metal cart [(like this one)](https://images.cb2.com/is/image/CB2/GoCart3ShelfCarbon3QS11/$web_zoom_furn_colormap$/130830204129/go-cart-carbon-three-shelf-table.jpg). On one side, I zip-tied a piece of showerboard (whiteboard that you buy unmounted from Lowe's or HD). On that, I wrote my objectives, curriculum, DOL, etc.
On the top level, I kept a clipboard with seating charts, my grade/attendance book (I use a paper copy even though everything is electronic because the paper book is easier to use during messy art class), restroom passes, a pencil cup with my necessary pens, highlighters, etc. I also had [one of these](https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0139846_sc7?$std$) facing the classroom for students to turn work into, with [one of these](https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0084689_sc7?$std$) on top with two files for each class (one for random bits of paperwork like used hallpasses, and one for graded work I needed to return). I keep anything a student gives me, just in case I need proof. Like the year I almost got in trouble for not allowing a student to go to the clinic, except that I had all of the signed clinic passes that they brought back to me...   
On the middle level of the cart, I kept the supplies I needed, arranged in bins and tubs for easy moving.  
The bottom level was for artwork, which varied yearly in how I arranged it. I never found a ""perfect"" solution, but I think the best was plastic portfolios for each class.  
When I had ""big"" supplies, like paint and brushes, I kept those in a cardboard box and I recruited a student to help me move it to my next room.  
The only artwork that I didn't keep on the cart was sculpture. I did 2 sculpture projects each year, and organized my curriculum with that of my host-teachers, so that my students could store their sculptures in the classrooms without interfering with their sculpture storage. This would comparable to doing group projects in math - I think you would benefit from talking with your host teachers about your plans, and seeing about temporary storage space for such projects. All of my host teachers were willing to work with me, especially once they got to know me.
  
Don't be afraid to work with the teachers. My host teachers would frequently stay in the room to work on things they needed to do, like grading. Part of my classroom rules/expectations had to do with leaving the other teacher alone and not bothering them. If I really needed to work on something in their room during my planning period, I would clear it with them ahead of time, and then would sit quietly in a back corner doing whatever it was."
highschoolteachers,"I see a HUGE difference between grade 7 and 8 but I do not hear about maturity among 9th graders at our high school. My dad taught grade 9 science for 15 years and said the same thing.
"
highschoolteachers,"I think this is becoming a common thing, especially with bigger districts.  The district I student taught at was huge (6 middle schools, 5 high schools) and they had reps from each school meet to create new pacing guides when Common Core rolled out.  They still meet twice a year to modify the midterm and final exams, as those are common between the district."
highschoolteachers,"First to in my family to graduate high school and college right here! 

Of course I'd support my daughter if she wanted to be a teacher, but I'd make sure she knew how tough the first few years are going to be.

I hate the idea of her being crushed the way new teachers are during thier first years of teaching :-( 

*Edited because I realized the post was asking if you'd suggest teaching to your own child, not your students!"
highschoolteachers,"High school kids are much, much easier behavior-wise than middle school kids (to me). I've taught both age groups. However, middle school kids are still at the age where you can make a major difference in thier lives. I feel like (again- my opinion) reaching a middle school kid is more rewarding, maybe because it IS so much harder to work with them.

I had problems teaching middle school last year, myself. It's hard to focus on the kids and a subject when you have trouble fitting in with co-workers, and fitting in is a big thing at my school. I was completely alone, hired two days before the school year began, and wasn't told anything- not even where to go during a fire drill or how to take attendance. The frustration was overwhelming. I'm still the pariah at my school, though a couple of teachers do say 'good morning' to me now.

I let the kids walk all over me and had some terrible behavior issues. I had four students diagnosed with ODD in one class, and I, having taught high school a few years earlier, was not aware that kids today can really just say they aren't going to do any work and it doesn't matter. Getting good grades is completely optional at my school because students move to the next level no matter what their grades are. (But guess what- many kids work hard to get good grades and learn new things anyway)!

It felt like the world was ending most days last year, but then- I'd just think of the kids, even the ones who were difficult to teach:

The little computer genius who got all A's without trying and coded during class every chance he got! 

The great kid who invited me to his baseball game. When his teammate wasn't doing well pitching he ran right up to him and patted him on the shoulder and encouraged him.

The 7th grader who accidentally came to my 8th grade class on the first day of school and sat there cooly until I was finished explaining the syllabus before he admitted his mistake and left.

And one 8th grade girl with an amazing, over-the-top personality I'll always remember for telling me that I was a good teacher. She even asked for tutoring for subjects I didn't even teach!

There are so many!! I don't know; I'm rambling.I read a book titled ""If You Can't Manage Them, You Can't Teach Them."" It's a blunt title, I know. But I got some good tips from the reading. I'm going into it this year with the attitude that I am the number one influence in my classroom, and that the students and the subject I teach will be MUCH more important to me than other  people's opinions. 

In short, if you love the kids, are comfortable with having a couple of pretty overwhelming and often frustrating (and at times completely, utterly awful) years and you are ready to work on classroom management (even with kids whose behavior cannot be managed easily), you CAN be a great, inspiring teacher. I really believe you would fall in love with the profession after a while. If you can do these things take the job and get through the first tough years!

Also, I don't know if you have little ones, but having the summer off with my little girl this year was amazing! The summer break is one perk none of us can ignore! "
highschoolteachers,"So I started at a new school with a brand new set of kids during ESY (Extended School Year, which is like summer school but for SPED kids).  I was working with brand new kids, brand new aides, I had never taught high school, and I had a class of 16 students and the biggest class I had before that point was 8 kids.  Yeah.  Totally out of the water.  I had kids who were mostly nonverbal.  I had put name tags on all the desk and as we got students off the bus we sat them in their desks.  I had a name on a desk and an extra kid.  He had a name on his backpack.  It didn't match any names on the desks.  I started to panic.  I was missing a student and had an extra student.  I called my principal in a dead panic.  Turns out that the kid went by a completely different name then his legal name and nobody thought to tell me (think his legal name was Frank but he went by Sealy).  Yeah."
highschoolteachers,"Scool starts on the 15th and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. It's my first teaching job, and I just signed my contract on this Monday so I haven't really had a chance to write any lesson plans yet. my room will be ready for me Monday, I'm just ready to get to work! I'm also a little worried about classroom overcrowding. At the high school where I teach 40 kids per class seems to be the norm. With only two prep periods it should be manageable right?"
highschoolteachers,"For the longest time, I didn't understand what preps were.  Then I figured it out (I'm a band teacher).  I then realized that all of my classes are different preps.  Sure we play music, but good lord are all the instrument classes and different grade classes wildly different.  So I've taught 6 preps all my teaching career (9 years) and I see why many band directors leave the profession.  6 preps on top of having 340 students this year for 5 of those preps and 175 if you count the high school band (the other 1 of my preps).  I'm exhausted and school hasn't even started.  Glad you talked to your admin and got your prep amount lowered, that will help tremendously!"
highschoolteachers,Thanks for the clarification. I had a totally different definition. I agree with you that the teacher you described resembles more of a daycare provider. I had a lot of teachers like that in high school.
highschoolteachers,"I have taught elementary, middle, and am now in my third year of high school. There is something special and awesome about every age. the elementary kids are still little, and sweet, and curious. However the need so much more out of you every single day. The trade off is the whimsy versus the effort.

I enjoyed my curriculum in middle school, I taught world cultures and loved it.  The kids are definitely moody. The age allows for a mixture between serious and more playful work, and can often be game-i-fied.

High School is cool because of the content, I am passionate about it, the kids feed off of that, and every year I get a handful of kids who get turned on to the Social Sciences that maybe would have never been otherwise.

All in all there is something great at every level, and I like to think in a couple years I might start back over at elementary."
highschoolteachers,"The benefit of ES is the low amount of students, less grading, and ""easier"" material. The benefit of Secondary is generally repeating periods of a single prep so you are planning less. (In terms of workload benefits. Obviously, there are other benefits depending on your preferences!) 

In ES, you have more planning (though in my district, ES teachers plan only ~6-8 hours per week max and that's if they WANT to use their own stuff, since they have many scripted programs, reading time, etc, plus shared materials on the district level that they are encouraged to use for all but interventions and extensions; I couldn't teach Elementary here because it's way too scripted). 

In Secondary, you have more grading in many subjects. (I grade ~150 multi-page essays just about monthly on top of projects, short writing, regular assignments, etc.) Some teachers have hundreds of students (my Band director who has 5 preps also has 600 students and an after school program!) and most of us have at least 125-150 (that's a small load of students, unless you teach something niche like ESE small setting inclusion) whereas our Elementary schools have class caps of 19 (intermediate) and 14 (primary) per the contract and no departmentalization. You can, of course, departmentalize an ES if you WANT to, but you can also use the single class model like my district does where a teacher can focus on a small group of kids and really KNOW them. In Secondary, we still have to constantly draw data on the strengths/weaknesses of our kids, track them, create differentiation to reach them all, but we have so many, it's harder to be effective with that. 

Just different difficulties. Also, the lesson planning is (IMO) more intensive the higher you go in grade level. I have taught Kinder, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th. For HS, I have to have way more content knowledge and sophistication (especially for my higher level kids to prepare for IB and AP) than MS and definitely more than Kindergarten or 3rd, where actual content knowledge was a non-issue. I do still brush up on my content, though I'm an expert and at multidisciplinary content, and I put MLA 8 citations on my slides when I use something from the internet. I do a lot of things I wouldn't do as someone presenting a lesson in Elementary. 

A lot of preps in high school are particularly hard for newer teachers either because they must fully design courses (like in electives) or have to catch up on a lot of very specific content. You're dealing with different KIDS and different SUBJECTS. One or the other is fine, I find. But both is the trouble. "
highschoolteachers,"Was the other job also high school? I ask because high school art generally has way less discipline problems than a middle school or even than many Elementary specials in some cases. The #1 issue you face with HS students in classes they don't want to be in is skipping, in my experience, in terms of frequency, and skipping -- while bad! -- is just not as in-your-face as the things you face at the lower levels. I'm sure this might vary by region and the fact that my school is an open campus and decently affluent/middle class (though we're 1/3 free/reduced lunch so not all kids) affects my view. 

It sounds like you've never had a permanent, full-time position and the school is, overall, a good school. I would suggest giving it a go if you didn't say that you really wanted to turn it down. If you really want to turn it down, you should. You might also want to call the school and talk to them about your concerns and the burnout you feel to suss out how supportive they will be (if you're comfortable turning it down, this can't hurt -- they may revoke the offer, but who cares at that point? That shows they're not supportive). Ask them specific questions about behavior support and the shared classroom, etc. "

highschoolteachers,"Welcome to the world of almost any music teacher. A high school choir teacher might have 4-5 different choirs, all that require different repertoire and different rehearsal strategies based upon skill level, behavior, etc. Then they probably teach a few sections of piano, guitar, or music theory in addition to their ensembles. Despite this, unfortunately many people think of us simply as their planning relief, or that our job is easy, we just ""have fun and make music all day!"" 

My advice is to stay WAY in front of your planning and keep meticulous notes about what each class gets to/doesn't get to in your plans so that you can adjust as you go. You might want to set a routine for the week that you follow for the year.. for instance in my choir classes every Monday-Wednesday we work on new sections music, every Thursday is dedicated to theory/written work, and Fridays we review what we did over the week or have tests/ quizzes when needed. Kids settle into the routine and know what to expect before class starts which helps a lot with classroom management. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm from Canada and recess goes right up until high school (grade 9), after that students have enough of a break between classes"
highschoolteachers,"My mom was the first in her family (6 siblings) to graduate with a bachelors. Dad did not finish high school. I'm not the first of the ""next generation"" in my family to get a bachelors but I'm the first to get a masters, and the second person to get one at all in the family. Feels cool to have pursued something I'm passionate about to a high level. "
highschoolteachers,"Preps are just the different courses you have to teach.  They like to load preps onto the new teachers.. for example, a new high school teacher might have 3-4 preps.  They might have to teach 2 sections of American Lit, 2 sections of European Lit, and 1 section of Yearbook.  They have to ""prep"" for three different types of classes. 

Teaching an elementary lesson is different from a middle or high school lesson.  The rigor is different and the methods are different.  Apples and oranges!  

Also, I really don't understand how you elementary teachers work.  I'd die having to work with little kids lol"
highschoolteachers,"My dad scraped by in high school with a 1.67 GPA, but got a great apprenticeship with a union and my mom was a waitress for years. Eventually, she went to nursing school at a community college. However, I'm still considering my self a first generation college graduate because when it came to financial aid, student loans, and choosing colleges, my parents didn't have a clue."
highschoolteachers,"A prep refers to a different class/grade level that you need to teach. I have 4 preps because I teach 4 different levels of Japanese with 2 duplicate levels. I see about 120 kids/day. Many of my other world language co-workers have other teachers also teaching their language so they can divide up their preps so that 1 teacher might teach 6 classes but only 2 different levels (thus, they can recycle material easier) while the other teacher has the other 2 levels.

Thus, when you compare my workload to my coworkers, you can see I have a lot more work. I can't directly share material or ideas with anyone (at least, not without having to heavily edit and change things) because I'm on an island by myself. Whereas they're working with just 1 or 2 textbooks, I'm juggling 3 or 4. It takes me much longer to finish preparing for all of my classes compared to them.

But to compare high school and elementary school teachers is like comparing apples to oranges. We're in two very different educational worlds with very different expectations and standards."
highschoolteachers,"In my district, social studies and science are really only taught at the elementary level once or twice a week, not every day.  Elementary teachers mostly teach ELA, Reading, and Math.  They have 15-20 children that they see all day.

In my district, many of us HS teachers teach totally different classes each period with maybe 1 or 2 repeats.  For example, last year I taught 2 periods of Earth/space, 2 of chemistry, one of chemistry 2, and 1 of physical science.  I see around 100 students in a day (and in many high schools, this is a small number).

That being said, these arguments are ridiculous.  Teaching isn't a pissing contest.  We all have pros and cons for the level we teach.  I personally would never teach elementary school because my personality just doesn't work for that level.  I don't look at elementary teachers and think ""boy, they have it easy!"". I know they don't.  I may not be well-versed in the difficulties they face - as I've never taught elementary, but I know they exist.  They also tell me pretty much the same thing - ""Oh I could never teach high school!  That would be too hard!"" etc.  Thankfully it's not a contest around here."
highschoolteachers,"At my high school, a ""prep"" is the course you're teaching. So last year, I had two preps: English 3 and AP Lang. That's two different courses that I had to plan and grade for. I only had one ""prep period,"" which is the period of the day where I don't have a class.

It's confusing nomenclature, since they both use the word prep. So when I say I have two preps, people might think I have two periods in the day to prep, when I really mean I have two courses to prep for."
highschoolteachers,"In part, the kindergarten work lacks intellectual rigor for an adult so it isn't ""hard"" to prep or grade. How long would it take you to pre-read a book you wanted to read your kindergarten class? Now compare that to preparing to teach 20 pages out of The Odyssey. How about coming up with a writing prompt for kindergarten and grading the student writing. Compare that to developing a writing prompt for high school and then grading the student writing when students are expected to have knowledge of grammar, content, spelling, MLA formatting, citations, the writing cycle, etc. It's going to take a lot more time and work. Yes, you prep a lot of subjects and it takes a lot of work to be thoughtful about your planning but we have to do all that same thoughtfulness with work that is rigorous for adults as well as for children."
highschoolteachers,"The shortest answer is almost all standards, college courses, and higher high school courses require that knowledge and information. Many individual teachers don't have the ability or flexibility to modify content that drastically. 

In terms of conceptualization, I describe it to my students into two main ways:

1) It's an important distinction to showcase functions being represented in different ways. The ability to manipulate one equation into others is the vast majority of high level mathematics. Just like solving a linear equation means creating a wide variety of equivalent expressions and equations, modifying linear functions into others is a very valuable and translatable math skill. 

2) Using the example of standard, point slope, and slope intercept form - each of these equations is most valuable in different situations. Also converting a visual or graphical representation is easier if certain considering are met. For example, a decimal y intercept is very difficult for slope intercept form if it isn't given in the actual situation. If you have two random points, it is much easier in point slope. Teaching when one type is valuable over others is a lesson that had incredible value with my students. 

So I can't speak for that specific teacher, but those are the general ways I explain the reasoning to my students. "
highschoolteachers,"I taught remedial classes the last two years at a traditional high school and the layout looked very similar to yours. 

A few pieces of advice:
1) don't be afraid to try new things, especially when you feel the same ol routine getting stale
2) don't be afraid to scrap things that just aren't working the way you envisioned
3) at-risk kids NEED positive adult relationships. If you can spend some time every day talking to kids and getting to know them (silly questions, not math related) that will go a long way in getting them to work for you
4) get real with them. In my classes, I wanted students to feel free to express how they felt so that they would be more comfortable and willing to do what I asked. That started with setting the tone and sharing parts of my story with them to relate to them. 

Good luck this year. The first two grading periods are the hardest. Don't be ashamed if you go home crying every day. Power through and don't give up because it definitely gets better!!!"
highschoolteachers,"I don't think so at all. You may not be able to find a job at a premier high school right away, but you'll inevitably find a job and soon you'll be in the trenches doing it day in and day out with the people who have full fledged math degrees. My first few years were at a low income school that was struggling mightily to find math teachers. My team lead taught middle school for 10+ years before moving. We had multiple people who have business degrees and did alternative certification. We had people who taught English for years before switching. At the end of the day, we were all there for the kids so it didn't matter the backgrounds. "
highschoolteachers,"Weird, my middle school ELLs loved popcorn. I actually feel horrible for introducing it at one of my observation sites, because the teacher jokes that the students never stop asking her for it.

Might have helped because it was a small group that knew each other well in a pullout setting.

Otherwise yeah, nobody likes popcorn, especially in high school."
highschoolteachers,"I don't really have a set grade to teach, since my student's ages vary, but I have younger high school ELLs.

I like that they're nearly adults (if not already, legally) and we can have serious and thoughtful discussions in class about many different topics. I also appreciate that even though we have some serious misunderstandings/difficulties at times, my students support each other and watching them bond is special.

I hate that they're nearly adults and have seen more shit than their peers."
highschoolteachers,"I am, but I wouldn't advise my students to go into education unless they genuinely wanted to and I saw they had a talent for it. I'd also do what my own teacher suggested I do in high school - get as much experience working or volunteering with kids as possible. I worked at a youth center for middle schoolers when I was 17 and a kid threw a chair at me on my first day, and when I left for the day I was like ""you know what, there was tons of good stuff that happened to me today too. Also, how much worse can it get? (it was possible, dw)"" 

That's kind of when I knew. Thank you, my former high school teachers!

However, as a first-gen student I make it my damn MISSION to get my students prepared and where they want to be after graduation. If it's college, the military, work, whatever - I don't care. I had to figure it out by myself and it was really hard, and I teach ESL so my students have even more strikes against them than I did. I will teach them the tools they need to find information on careers, programs, financial aid, etc."
highschoolteachers,"high school, same subjects...I do 60% major assessments (tests, papers, projects), 30% minor (hw, quizzes, Socratics, notebooks), 10% participation (I do 2 points per day...they get them unless they lose them).  

I'm switching to having kids do all homework, journaling, etc. in a notebook this year which they will turn in a couple of times a quarter for a 30% grade...they cheat, and we go over everything in class, and trying to keep up with grading daily assignments was becoming a nightmare.  This way they still know that their work counts.  

I'm toying with just going to straight points for next year, but I'm not quite ready to shift that way yet.  "
highschoolteachers,"It sounds like the first thing you need to do is get some experience working with kids. You could try tutoring or after school program volunteering. Check out your local Boys and Girls Club or YMCA - see if they have a need for volunteers. 

Re: the accent. No one will care about it.

Re: your choice of age group. Middle school kids are far more wild than high school. High school students have a lot of external pressures (college, graduation requirements) that help them ""Take school seriously."" Middle school is a low-stakes school (you get bumped up to the next grade even if you fail your classes) AND coincides with puberty. Middle school is wild!"
highschoolteachers,"I am a first generation college student, yea. Both of my older brothers had dropped out of high school (they have long since completed it) even, so when I graduated in the top 10 of my class, that was an accomplishment alone.

I don't discourage students from going into teaching (so few of them want to), but I do tell them that it's difficult, especially in Illinois. Students who are interested in teaching are usually aware of the details, though."
highschoolteachers,"Agreed. I've taught every grade from 7th to seniors, and I think sophomores are my favorite. They've gotten rid of some of the squirrely behaviors of freshman year and are starting to come into their own. They have more responsibility (getting their license, which helps them focus on their grades a bit more) and they can typically think of life after high school and how what they're doing now affects it, unlike freshmen who are just so overwhelmed with the transition to high school that they can't always see how their grades now matter."
highschoolteachers,"Year 9 Social Studies (13-14yo) and Year 12 Social Studies (16-17yo).

Things I love about the Year 9s: generally enthusiastic, willing to learn new things, most of the time being sidetracked becomes more educational moments, one of my classes is made up of 100% lovely kids that I'm always looking forward to seeing whenever I have them.

Things I hate about the Year 9s: bad habits (academic and behavioural) start early and you have to nip them in the bud, Year 9s are new to high school so they love to start drama just to see where it happens, if I have them the period after lunch time or the last period of the day they're usually too hyped up to learn anything, sometimes they just have bad days behaviour-wise and I'm trying not to lose sleep over it.

Things I love about the Year 12s: more collegial relationships, not as demanding of my attention

Things I hate about the Year 12s: if they're not motivated, don't expect them to hand anything in. The bad habits they developed in the previous year levels are set in and become very hard to break, especially when it comes to academic skills. They have other things on their mind like getting part-time jobs or driver's licences or their love lives and tend to forget that school is still the most important thing. Also, Social Studies is not compulsory at Year 12, but it's still shitty when the kids who choose to take it don't take it seriously."
highschoolteachers,"Mainly 10th (English) and I think it's the second greatest age to teach (11th being the best). Once you hit the main part of the year, sophomores are excellent and they get better throughout the year, unlike seniors who get worse typically. 10th content is okay (11/12 probably has better standards and novels to my taste), and we get a lot of freedom to choose our units and texts. But really I just like the age of the kids. They're just learning to drive, maybe getting jobs, settling into high school and thinking about the future in solid ways for the first time. They can do some decent thinking, but they're still slightly malleable. "
highschoolteachers,"Middle school was the only place where I've heard a kid tell the teacher ""it's okay Ms. G, we all make mistakes."" In high school, they're like sharks smelling blood in the water."
highschoolteachers,"I'm not. Both of my parents and my grandparents  went to college. They were all in the medical field. Growing up, college was never once mentioned and education wasn't stressed at all. My parents didn't care about my grades or my future plans, so I finished high school with no plans for further education. Eventually, after a couple of years in retail, I paid my way through school and earned a degree and a nice job. But, when I went back to school for my teaching degree, my family acted like it was a terrible decision and very much beneath me. 

However, nearly every teacher that I've ever met has some family member, usually mom, that is a teacher. "
highschoolteachers,About to start my 22nd year teaching and I just had my first school dream/nightmare of the summer. In my dream my aide and I were sent to a high school to observe a student - but we had to get there in this  old temperamental VW bug I had when I was 16. I loved that car but it was a pain in the ass. This just means it's August. 
highschoolteachers,"Female secondary school teacher from Texas here. 

I just changed jobs, but my previous high school enforced the business casual thing pretty seriously.  

Dresses or tunics that covered your rear, leggings or knee length skirts or dresses. No flip flops at all. 

Tennis shoes and jeans on Fridays. Some dress up or spirit days throughout the year. Our school had a minor fiasco a couple years back and we got jeans for a while, but that was a chaos-fueled decision, haha, with closed toed shoes because fiasco.

I wore slacks, blouse with cardigan or blazer with ballet flats in a variety of combinations each day. 

Coaches got away with shorts, t shirts, and tennies, but male teachers had to wear slacks and polos or button downs, female coaches the same as above, unless on game day (and last year they moved towards every kid dressing up on their sport's game day, so a lot of coaches 'dressed up' too with them).

Our school took dress code seriously because formal (more formal) dress for teachers set a professional standard for the students, too. 

Plus, for me, it was a good jumping off point about being an adult and adults having dress codes when kids (they were always girls) were sent to the office in violation of the school's dress code"
highschoolteachers,"Man. I remember HAVING that check-out mentality. Hell, I've had it at every job I've quit since high school! Haha! But it is exciting to be able to get more in depth with your subject. "
highschoolteachers,"My mom graduated from college when I was in high school. My sister was already in college. So we're not exactly first-gen, but we're the first to go the traditional route.
If my students showed an actual interest in education (beyond just summers off or being in charge), I'd definitely encourage them to pursue it. I love teaching, despite the problems."
highschoolteachers,"First in my family to graduate high school, obtain a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree. Felt great. Doesn't feel fantastic paying the massive student loans."
highschoolteachers,"If your school is okay with it, try a graphic novel or two. There's great options, and students engage with them in ways that can be awesome to see. Watchmen is great for discussing morality, authority, and social control. Pride of Baghdad is amazing to help students look at other groups as humans. Then there are standbys like American Born Chinese, Persepolis, and Maus that are good reads for high school.

I teach an elective that is exclusively about comics and graphic novels, and it's amazing what students can pull from these texts just because they're less intimidating feeling to them."
highschoolteachers,"I'm first gen as well. My students are in MS, but I don't really advise them into a specific career. I can think of one student I have ever told she should be a teacher, and I meant it. Knowing her as a senior in high school now, I still mean it.

I was told that I should be a teacher by my 7th ELA Teacher, I guess I listened.

Edit: changed ""kids"" to ""students"" as not confuse with my progeny. "
highschoolteachers,"That's so lame for a high school. We dressed up as Minions for Halloween but I work at an elementary school. Haha good luck! 

However my bad attitude isn't helpful, most of us wore jeans and went to Wal-Mart or Target for cheap yellow Hanes t-shirt. Pop the lenses out of cheap black sunglasses. Done. "
highschoolteachers,"I only have one semester, due in January. Also not going back til September 18! Hope you don't mind if i ask a couple questions about. Things I've been struggling with.

Are you planning on telling your students right away, or waiting a while? I'm not sure when to tell mine (high school). I can probably hide it for a month, maybe. Are you letting them know you will be gone the whole second half of the year, or leaving it vague? Finally, are you worried at all about connecting with students? I only have a few months with them so I'm worried I'll be kind of checked out, but that's not fair to them. 

Thank you in advance!"
highschoolteachers,"Holy crud do I wish my old high school would adopt a more....updated ""computer"" course. Then again, I was back in the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing &amp; Number Munchers day. Also Oregon Trail if we were lucky. With today's tech-heavy climate, I think the ability to be smart and safe online is crucial...not to mention the idea that kids ""know"" technology because they are active on soc. media and the internet. I always tell them, surfing the internet is a not a resume-worthy skill, but being proficient in business software is, so shush and open a new spreadsheet. "
highschoolteachers,"First year teacher here...

I had a nightmare that woke me up a few nights ago, I can't remember what it was though. I just remember thinking, of course this happens on my first day.

I think I got horribly sick from something and threw up in class. Which happened on my actual first day of high school when I was younger."
highschoolteachers,"If I got to design a course it would be public speaking and rhetoric. I teach elementary so it wouldn't be as intense as a high school elective but I think it would be a valuable skill to develop early. 

I sort of got to design a course this past year. I was asked to work with GT students during RTI blocks because the classroom teachers couldn't plan for them on top of ELL/SPED/everything else going on.  I did the Middle Ages and covered topics like castles, artwork, the plague, the barbarian tribes, and daily life of people at the time. It was super cool to be able to plan that out! The kids absolutely loved it. This was 4th grade, most (if not all) were reading above a 6th grade level already so I felt pretty comfortable really challenging them with history and literature. "
highschoolteachers,I'm a brand new high school Theatre teacher with zero acting/theatre experience (I also teach English IV) and would love to have someone to bounce ideas off of and share resources...
highschoolteachers,"I'm very passionate about teaching high school theatre. I think the arts are very VERY important in our society. I teach at a small private school very similar to the one I graduated from. I felt very alone back then. There was no place for the creative kids to go. The arts programs were poorly funded/nonexistent. I was surrounded by jocks and had no outlet for self-expression. (Not that there's anything wrong with sports.) So I wanted to create a safe haven for the kids to be weird and explore. I thought about what I needed but didn't get in high school, and I knew I could create that for the next generation. That's why I became a teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I work at a school that is tied with a orgainzation that deals with children who have experienced repeated trauma and are dealing with emotional and behavioral problems (Self harm, suicide, drug use, sexual abuse). Most of the clients/students have either been court ordered there or recommended by a psychiatric institution. 

The school is under staffed and underfunded. We only have four main teachers, the principal, one EC coordinator, and a data manager. We also have two day treatment staff but they aren't part of the school staff.

Anyways the school had normally ran a year long schedule for some unknown reason.  This year the principal is wanting to switch to semesters to offer more classes/credits. However she is also wanting more EC staff and has been trying to get all of the teachers EC certified (even though some of us have been trying to tell her that even if we could pass the test it doesn't mean we could do the job) with the idea of one of the teachers acting as a second EC staff and doing one-on-one support in the room.

This means we are going to have two, three block, semesters where I will be teaching ELA in the fall and social studies in the spring. 

And to make it even more fun we have mixed classrooms. In a perfect setup I may have all middle school kids  in one class and all high school kids in another. However that rarely works and due to behavioral issues or not having enough room in one class we may end up with a handful of all grades in each class.  

A lot of times it feels like the school portion is an afterthought. And I know my principal is doing the best she can, its just that without more admin staff she has to try and do everything her self which also puts a lot of pressure on us teachers. 

So yeah its an interesting situation. And last year teaching there was my first year teaching. Really I was going to try and find a job at a standard school this year but with both our data manager and math teacher leaving I felt like I should stay just so our principal didn't crazy from loosing half of her teaching staff plus all her admin staff in a single year. 

As for why I was picked? Well mainly because I'm right out of college so it apparently means I can do everything!!! At first the principal wanted me to teach Maths. I had to put my foot down on that one. It would not have been good for me or the students. At one point she wanted me to do Science so our science teacher could do the EC stuff. However I feel that our science teacher probably talked her out of that. But hey at least I'm certified to teach middle school science so it would have been closer. 

I would have been doing EC this semester if PRAXIS didn't screw up and give me the wrong test (the main one you have to take for Social Studies). Ohh and she still wants everyone to take the test as soon as possible anyways. 

So yeah that's why I will be doing ELA without a certification. As to if that is legal in my state? I'm unsure. We already straddle the line between public and private school due to our setup as being a medical facility so I think we have some leeway. I mean it wouldn't be the first sketchy thing. Last year we all ""volunteered"" to give up our one free block to provide EC services in other classes. 

"
highschoolteachers,"Asics sneakers. 

Female high school teacher

No one should care about your shoes. You're on your feet all day and off you're wearing fancy professional shoes they're gonna fuck up your feet. 

I wore heels every day for like 10 years. I had to have surgery on my foot back in January because wearing heels is bad for you. "
highschoolteachers,"Minions?? For high school? Seriously? The first day?  Is the principle going to be gru? (just think of the symbolism there).  

I agree with everyone else.  Jeans, cheap yellow shirt (try thrifts stores too).  Carry a banana.  Try to make the best of it.

Sorry about all this."
highschoolteachers,I've had a couple students over the years that were legitimately sensitive to strong smells and I never saw it in either file. It came up when the parents contacted me because their child was having difficulty with it. I requested the students with me that period (I teach high school) refrain from using colognes/perfumes and didn't use plug-ins that year. Solved the issue and the next year it was fine. 
highschoolteachers,"When I was a high school student, a teacher there created a Science Literature course and I was able to take it the second year it was offered. It was so fun! We read a few science fiction novels and researched the science behind them. We also did a lot of research on theoretical topics not usually covered in other science classes, like paradoxes and time travel. I also remember doing a big research project on global warming. "
highschoolteachers,Primary grades have the largest classrooms in my building. They are pretty good sized rooms. They are much bigger than the middle school classrooms. Our high school is very old and the rooms in it are pretty big as well. 
highschoolteachers,"Recognize that kids at that age are still working through their identity. Some kids feel that participating in anything makes them look uncool somehow. I highly doubt you can do anything at this point to have them risk their image. However, in the future, as others have stated, try team building/icebreakers at the very start. As corny as they can be, find a decent one. This builds a sense of community between the group members and will lead them to take more risks (participating in a yoga class might not seem like a risk to you, but to a teenager about to enter high school, literally any action could mean the difference between being the ""cool"" kid or being the ""loser"") moving forward."
highschoolteachers,"While in theory it is a great idea, I think it promotes not taking responsibility for work and due dates. Maintain a class website or have students keep an assignment log. It seems that they rely on this so much in middle school that when they get to high school they can't function. Most don't want to check a website and want you to tell them everything. This year I'm going to give some sort of extra credit or homework grade for keeping track of assignments, because this problem has become so pervasive. "
highschoolteachers,"This sounds a lot like my first year.  I am starting my 3rd year, but my 1st year was terrible.  (Last year wasn't a picnic, but third time's a charm, right?) I taught 3 periods of middle schoolers and 3 periods of high schoolers, but the high schoolers were the worst.  Attitude and apathy!  I actually ended up failing several of them because even after talking to them one on one and contacting home and writing them up, they still chose to do the least amount of work. 

 I started focusing on the students who actually wanted to be there, as well as the ones that were actually trying. I even changed what I taught and how I was teaching it to them so I could find something they were more interested in--this actually worked for several of them. Have you talked to admin about this?  Your school should have some sort of discipline plan in place once the student has been warned.  

Unfortunately, you will always have students who did not want to be in art class, and will make your life hell while they are there.  Don't quit!!!"
highschoolteachers,"This sounds like my first year!  I had middle and high school, and my high schoolers were full of attitude.  Some didn't even look at me in the hall this past year because I had failed them the year before...don't tell me you can't fail art! And everyone will laugh at you when you do!"
highschoolteachers,"A charter school did this to me too. I was hired for high school biology, ended up teaching 4th, 5th, 6th grade science. 

Since you already signed a contract, you can look at what the penalties are for breaking it. Or just soldier through this year and make plans for escape as soon as possible. A school that pulls this shit is probably one that you want to get away from when you can. "
highschoolteachers,It depends on the grade level for me. I would go with EC for Elementary and Plum Paper Planner for high school. 
highschoolteachers,I live and die by stations in my high school classes (30-35 kids) look up blended learning.  Great ideas and resources there
highschoolteachers,"Seems like you have a tough group that realizes they will be done in a week anyway. Maybe talk about the benefits of yoga and what it can do for people. You can lead a discussion on what they think is the purpose of yoga and why people do it. I googled ""yoga for high school"" and found a lot of good sites that had routines and partner poses."
highschoolteachers,"I wear [these pants](https://www.truspec.com/24-7-series/pants/mens-classic-pants/), a button down shirt or polo, and [these shoes.](http://www.keenfootwear.com/p/M-ATLANTA-COOL-ESD-SOFT-TOE.html?dwvar_M-ATLANTA-COOL-ESD-SOFT-TOE_color=1014604&amp;cgid=)  I teach elementary SPED, but I also wore this teaching high school SPED.  I'm a female teacher."
highschoolteachers,"I think you need to think about the type of kids you want to teach. When I had to choose, I chose high school because I loved my content area. I went through the Senior Years Stream at my University with History and English as my teachables. I taught Senior High only 1 year, because I didn't find it all that fun. It was great to talk to kids at a higher level about stuff I was passionate about, but in the end, I found it all too...serious. 

Since then, I've moved down to 6th Grade and it is the best choice I've ever made. I teach Math and French now, and I love my job more than ever. Kids are fun. "
highschoolteachers,"Not true in my district. Once you've made a successful grievance, if it's cut and dry like that, you're pretty much untouchable and will make tenure unless you really fuck up. But most teachers at my school have tenure anyway. It's the high school in the district people try to transfer to.

Every district is different. My union is pretty strong and my district pretty reasonable. They don't like principals violating the contract for petty issues like that especially. "
highschoolteachers,"If it's like my school (urban Title 1 high school), prepare nothing, because the list (and even teaching assignments) you have now will change, *radically*, the first three weeks of school. :-P

Otherwise, it sounds like you're already doing what you need to do!"
highschoolteachers,"Thank you, this is great advice. I'll definitely start contacting people. It's odd, because it seems like when I was in high school, the ads for universities came to me without me trying at all, but when you want a master's, you have to do some digging to know what's out there.

Do you like being a teacher educator? Is it what you expected to be doing when you were at the beginning of your career?"
highschoolteachers,"Look up Teacher's College mini lessons and see if you can adapt a high school standard and grade-level appropriateness to it.  Also, maybe try doing a Gradual Release of Responsibility (I do, we do, you do) format.. that may work!"
highschoolteachers,"Happily employed high school teacher in Ontario, B.A/B.Ed, thinking about an M. Ed but I haven't figured out from where yet... 
I think the question one should also ask is also, ""will the M. Ed. make you a better teacher?"" "
highschoolteachers,We don't have art classes in this school- kids get art credit taking an online class vis a vis the main high school.
highschoolteachers,"When I was a high school TA, I made copies, stapled, 3 hole punched, alphabetized, filed, graded worksheets, organized stuff in the teacher's cabinets and closet. All the grunt work! It was pretty fun."
highschoolteachers,"How can school choice benefit corporations, unless it is a for profit school?  I'm fairly sure for-profit charters make up less than 20% of the charter schools.  You've made this assertion about taking away public power over and over, but provided no actual example of this working in the past.  In any case, even if there is an example of it working, at what does it work?  How many years of students suffer through going to a bad school because in order to give the public power?  I have given the example of my town's high school, with no separate optikn.  People have banded together in the past the past to fix it.  It hasn't worked.  People have different visions of what they want, and that has translated into no policies being passed, or bad policies being passed.  This makes sense... it's a single school trying to meet the needs of a population of 35000 people.  What has happened as a result?  A failing school in way more ways than test scores.  The college admission and drop out rate is very high, gangs are prevelant, truancy levels are far above average... all this in addition to horrible test scores.

Parents shold have an individual choice because they are individual families with individual needs.  What your kids need is likely not what my kids need, and that's a good thing.  Taxes are a false equivalnce.  For one, the use of taxes are a constant source of argument by the people who wish to direct the spending of it towards a local or individual need.  I have no use of a wheelchair accessible ramp anywhere in this town, nor do I need the little league field they just built.  Both of those are a need of a small portion of the population, yet the tax system accommodated them.  No argument there, it was a want/need of the people.  Same argument can be made for public and charter.  The tax system, when not abused, should work for the people and their needs."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. Two of my students from last year (I'm at a different school now) work as checkers at the grocery store I shop at.

I assume they all know how much booze I go through in a week now."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;The boy who put the stray kitten in his locker that he found on the way to school so he could take it home after school.

Aw.  That's kind of cute actually.

When I was in high school, I decided to get a pet rat without consulting my mother.  Instead of leaving it at home where it could be found, I took this rat everywhere with me.

This rat stayed inside a modified purse (with bedding, water, breathing holes) or my cargo pants pocket.  It came with me to school everyday and even to my after school jobs--Sonic Drive-In and Bi-Lo. (What is health codes and sanitation when you are 15?)

I did this with more than one rat.  My last one escaped while I was shopping for prom dresses at the mall.  No adults ever discovered my rat babies.

I just thought I needed to share that. "
highschoolteachers,"Heh this resonates a lot with me, thanks for sharing.  I taught in Asia for several years, and during such time continued my studies.  I did the TR course and decided to give it a go back here in the states for a bit.

I'm sort of torn on the whole deal so far.  Granted, it's the beginning of the year and my American teaching career but I find it pretty dispiriting.  

First, tests.  I work at a relatively low level school and it seems it's an endless barrage of tests.  I've read some stories that say it's not as bad as initially reported but I disagree.  My students are very low level, and in a high school setting are not likely to pass the exams.  Thus, they get to sit the tests over, and over, and over.  (Because yeah, it's fair to give them as many chances as possible in order to get a diploma).

Then we have curriculum.  The curriculum isn't bad for kiddos who are at grade level, but mine are several years lower.  So, I'm busy scrambling for materials so that my kids can learn *something*. 

Finally, of course the behavioral issues we see here vs what I'm used to in my previous jobs in Asia.  Much has been said here. 

Well, TL;DR:  Get your credential through an alternative program and perhaps look at gigs back in Asia.  I'm very much convinced I'll be doing the same!"
highschoolteachers,"Allowing choice makes bad schools worse?  .Allowing parents to choose who will educate their children, instead of forcing parents into a one or two schools, is bad?

I come from a town that has a high school that has been failing for 30+ years.  Less that 50% of the student achieve satisfactory results on their testing, drugs and gangs are a constant problem, truancy levels are through the roof. There is no private school or charter high school in town.  The problens has not gotten better, despite this being a mostly forced choice on parents.  Why should anyone be forced to send their kids to this?"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a secondary Ed social studies student and we have to do projects where we come up with all kinds of decor for our class. I want to teach high school history and they want colorful posters with positive messages. I hate these assignments. I want to learn how to teach, not how to coddle a bunch of kids into a mediocre adulthood where they need constant affirmation."
highschoolteachers,"First day for me is always the same.  But then, I teach high school physics and I start at the beginning of the year...so as a student teacher, your mileage may vary.  

1) I start with activities to help me benchmark them and for them to benchmark me.  I give them something that I can see their strengths and weaknesses.  I usually start with a lab activity doing something they already know but need to learn how to explain.  For me, it's measuring speed of a toy car and presenting it as a lab report.  For you...well, that might be different.

2) I think most new teachers in a good district will use their coworkers as pacing guides.  Or at least I did and it saved me bacon.  If you're lucky your coworkers will be willing to share.  I personally don't understand why anyone wouldn't share.  Especially in elementary school, isn't that a thing you guys/gals teach?

3) It varies.  In Pennsylvania you're supposed to be assigned a mentor when hired and be mentored for the first year or two.  There's also a multi year induction system designed to acclimate you to your district.  Mine does a great job with that, I don't know about other districts/states.  

But coworkers, again, are your saviors. Be nice to them, listen to them AND don't be afraid to deviate from them.  Likely, you'll start as they do and then, as the year and future years go on, you'll develop your own style.  

You're not going to be perfect the first time through.  That's OK.  Do your best, work hard, and when you make a mistake (you will, trust me....from experience) get back up, figure out what went wrong (that's important!) and figure out how to change it.  One of the best parts about this job is that you get another chance to fix it for next year.  You'll always be changing what you do.  This is my twelfth year and I'm still changing things and getting better at what I do.  I hope I keep that up until I retire.

Good luck!  And don't forget to get some sleep in.  Student teaching is exhausting."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; Teacher! He called me a bad boy! Teacher! He cut me at the water fountain. Teacher! She told me my bag was ugly. Teacher! Blah blah blah blah blah.

Well, these are all stupid, so I wouldn't address them. (Granted, I teach high schoolers, but I have taught Kindergarten and 3rd.) I'll address things that matter. 

I haven't really had to do this in HS, thank God (and actually never had to do much of this BS when I briefly taught ES, but that was overseas), but I taught middle school for a long time and they're annoying about this shit. First, I make the student write a statement if it's something that really mattered. Then, I'll investigate, maybe have the ""offender"" write a statement too. 

If it's something that actually mattered, the class usually witnessed it and someone will speak out (write out really). I teach them early on that it's not ""snitching"" to help someone get legitimate justice, like if Sally's phone is stolen and you don't say who took it, you're just as guilty, and think how you'd feel in Sally's place. I usually have enough decent folk that Sally's phone always got found. 

If not, I'd turn it over to a Dean. 

But even with little ones, I wouldn't go around policing that someone said your bag was ugly. I think I'd just say, ""Wow, that's rude; it's frustrating when people are rude, huh"" and move on with life. And then counsel them not to tattle about every little thing but only address important injustices. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a chatty group too (though I'm high school) and I dealt with it by doling out TONS of compliments to the entire group when they were being quiet AFTER I explained I was doing a hard reset on behavior and that shouting out etc was not going to be tolerated. If kids behaved poorly they got a far (basically a high school timeout for 5 minutes in another class), enough far's can earn them a trip to the principal. For your roughhousers maybe you should just start by explaining exactly what is going to happen when you see it again and then enforce that. That's fighting and could end up hurting someone. Send them down to the principal every time something like that."
highschoolteachers,"I have two recommendations.  Look up Staff Loungin', hands down my favorite education podcast.  It's by these Canadian teachers with lots of experience and a great sense of humor.

Also, I literally just put up my second episode a few hours ago.  I'm a high school math teacher, and my guests are from various places in the ed world, so we will probably hit on the topics you mentioned in upcoming episodes.

highschoolteachers,"Oh boy. Where to begin.

1. The boy who put the stray kitten in his locker that he found on the way to school so he could take it home after school.

2. Two cases of students having sex in a back stairwell that now has cameras and signs telling people there are cameras. 

3. Kid had an vape in his football locker that overheated and caught on fire. Half the football team instead of putting out the fire, video'd the live fire on their phones.

4. Hearing the kid say ""I'm upset. I only got a 34 on my ACT. (He was trying to make a very short list of nominees for a national award, and a 34 isn't high enough)

5. Teacher on second floor joking about when the drug dog comes through the room, not to pet it, yada, yada when one kid bolts to the lab and by the time the teacher gets back there he's halfway out the window ready to jump down.

6. Strip Super Smash Brothers. That's all that needs to be said.

7. Two kids are asked to get something from a teacher's car. The nick the main key and at lunch decide to go drive to a major city 7 hours away. That's where OnStar finally found the car.

Never a dull moment at my high school!

highschoolteachers,"Two boys in my high school Latin class used to climb out the trailer window every Friday to go get doughnuts for everyone. Every. Friday. Our Latin teacher was pushing 80 so,

Ms. C: Where are Brandon and Matthew?

Us: They just went to the bathroom

Ms. C: Oh ok

15 minutes later

Ms. C: Where did these doughnuts come from?

Us: Ms. C do you want a doughnut?

Ms. C: Oh yes aren't y'all sweet!
"
highschoolteachers,"I wonder what it's like for some of my high school colleagues. It hasn't happened much at all since I went down one grade, but when I taught 8th, I had to deal with children in giant adult-man bodies thinking they were clever to loom over me and sometimes even buck up to me when they were mad. I've been able to hold my own and refuse to be intimidated, but if it were to come down to it, I'm under five and a half feet tall and I'd get my ass kicked."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;I do have a great admiration for charter schools and online schools and I do anticipate that as schools, like my prior high school, continue to fail their students, these options will become more prevalent. 

This opinion of yours assumes two equally false premises: one, that on the whole public schools ""fail their students"" (oft-repeated and rarely defined) and two, that on the whole charter schools don't (by similarly dubious, hackneyed measures).

If you want to understand the toxicity of the charter/school choice/school reform/privatization movement (all once separate ideas that have now unapologetically merged into a single, corporate-controlled monstrosity), you might consider starting with Michelle Rhee's disastrous reign as DC's chancellor. It's a textbook example of a corrupt school official destroying public education and then walking off scot-free to a cushy lobbying job--employed by the same moneyed interests that bought her loyalty in the first place."
highschoolteachers,"Speaking as someone who feared public speaking in high school, and visibly shook with a cracking voice no matter how well prepared I was, if I had the 'out' of doing a presentation only in front of my teacher after school, there would be no scenario where I would choose to instead speak in front of my class. It would simply be unthinkable, like asking if person with a broken leg whether he'd like to try walking without crutches today. There are ways to break down this fear, but I wouldn't start by having the kid talk in front of a full classroom. It will be hard enough doing the presentation only in front of you.

I would have been deeply troubled to be asked 3 times in class when this other arrangement had already been made. So, I feel the student's pain.

You might think you only asked twice, but the first 'How are you feeling?' is, to the student, you asking if she'll do it. She knew where that question was leading. After she said ""Not good,"" to her any further mention of the matter is unwelcome and anxiety-inducing.

If it happened to me, I'd feel extra unhappy in doing the presentation after school because I'd feel like my teacher really, really, really wanted me to do it in class and was not supportive of the agreement that had been made.

That said, I never got that sort of option in high school.

Edit: As for how to proceed, you need to repair the relationship with the student. I would do that by explaining my behavior -- my thought process -- and profusely apologize. An apology is less an admission of wrongdoing and more a representation of how much someone means to you."
highschoolteachers,"A female student did this to me (female teacher). It was (is) due to her distatchment disorder. This is high school level so thankfully I can avoid the student. It started the same way, constant inane conversation, sought me out constantly, was very disrespectful and insulting. I went to the point where she could only speak to me about school related things, more specifically what classes I taught or clubs I advised. One day she came in to my room to berate me about talking to her mother (her mother is a substitute aide in our building). That ended any conversation, admin sat her down and she was told to completely avoid me. 

While I am sure there is sexism there how is this students relationship with others? Has he sought you as a target? Has he targeted other authority figures in the past? From what you have said it seems the best is to limit contact. Fulfill your legal obligation to provide an education."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school math teacher. Here's how I do all my classes.

The gradebook is set up like this:
10% daily work (graded on completion)
6% standard 1
6% standard 2
6% standard 3
6% standard 4
6% standard 5
Then five more standards each with 12%

We had ten ""essential learnings"" and separated them into the most important and least important. Turned out to be 5 and 5. We wanted 60% to be most important, thus each category is 12. This leaves 30% for the least important 5, thus 6% each.

The daily work category is classwork and homework graded on completion only.

The standards categories come from assessments. Each assessment is broken up by standards (we just gave our third test, it tested 3 of the standards, so we report those three standards as a percent). Each standard will be assessed at least 3 times, with the newer times assessing it being weighted double the previous time's weight. So we are a hybrid of SBG and points. We use points, but our gradebook is set up by standard.

Edit: forgot to add, daily work is collected all at once at the end of each chapter. I don't collect ANYTHING on a day to day basis."
highschoolteachers,"What specifically makes you think this is a ""male not respecting females"" issue? As a male teacher I have very similar things happen with male students all the time in high school, usually the ones starved for attention and lacking in social skills due to isolation or family problems. Do you think there's a sexual element to it?"
highschoolteachers,"I honestly think that students may just be getting worse at cheating in general.  When I was student teaching, I had a student cheat on a short answer question on a test they took online. 

I was reading his answer and was very surprised by how well it was written...it was better than any other answer I'd seen and completely out of character for this student.  Then I got to the sentence ""See the figure of the bonfire below.""  Dead giveaway but I still had to google his answer to figure out where he'd gotten the answer, since I figured he'd just googled the question (what I would have done).  Only got one hit and that was from the digital copy of his text book.  He'd just copied and pasted it over.

I definitely cheated when I was a high school student but I distinctly remember putting a little bit of effort into changing my answer just enough to make it not word-for-word copying."
highschoolteachers,"I know that for many of my high school-aged kids, they do it because they're unfamiliar with the process of essay writing and it's been tolerated in the past. Admittedly 100% of my students are behind grade level (most severely), but to date it's still one of the most shocking realizations I've come to working in a very rural, very low income part of America. Some teachers just don't read the writing assignments they offer and others don't recognize cheating as a concern. 

I had seniors fail my class solely because they were asked to write a two-page response to a movie and they copied the whole thing from a scholarly source. But if you don't know any better and it's worked in the past, they're going to keep doing it!

So maybe the solution is to offer some very concentrated lessons on how to write an essay, how to cite your sources, why plagiarism is a problem, etc?"
highschoolteachers,"I'm not part of it, But I can tell you a few things I've seen them do. They are our ""Green Team""- collecting recyclables once a week from classrooms. They came up with a list of issues and plausible solutions and presented them to the principal, most of the suggestions were put into effect the same school.year which was awesome. When we had a door decorating contest, they got to vote on the winner. When we had high school athletes visit for a pep rally, they presented them with a ""treat""- a Gatorade each. That sort of stuff :) "
highschoolteachers,"I had a high school sophomore, who had only spoken English for two years, turn in an essay on Gutenberg that was copy and pasted from the history channel. I could tell after the first sentence."
highschoolteachers,"I interned at a high school. My mentor thought I was a student at first, and the kids would joke about my looks. Teaching high school would be super difficult for me!"
highschoolteachers,"This. I have uniforms, but during homecoming or something it's worse. Never, ever wear your hair down. Severe buns, make up, and act like you know wtf you're doing. I am high school and first year."
highschoolteachers,"Me!! I teach 16-18 year olds, I'm 25 &amp; have a babyface. People outside of work constantly mistake me for a high school student. At work I ALWAYS wear business casual clothing and try and carry myself as an adult. It helps! a little!"
highschoolteachers,"I am a teacher with a cleft lip and palate :).  I teach high school in an urban area.  This is my fifth year.  I have only ever had kids ask about my scar after I gave them a creative writing prompt to tell a story about a time they got a scar.  They seemed pretty impressed after I told them I was born with a birth defect and said it was no big deal. That said, my only evidence is a scar on my lip and I mumble occasionally because I can't hear very well (and I have to always ask kids to repeat themselves haha).  I had braces as a kid and stopped wearing my retainer,  so my teeth are pretty messed up again.  I got braces a while ago (Invisalign) and my kids thought that was cool too because it's something they're going through, so we can relate.  Finally, one of the teachers I work with doesn't have any hands, another one is in a wheelchair, and I've taught with a teacher previously who also didn't have a hand.  I have never heard a kid make fun of any of these individuals.  In fact, I think the kids really respect people who have overcome a defect or disability and lead productive lives.  It shows them they can make something out of their difficult situations too.  I wouldn't worry about it."
highschoolteachers,"In high school I had an English teacher who had dyslexia. He didn't tell us right away, but opened up about it after he had had our class for a few years. He showed us that determination and hard work can overcome huge obstacles. It made us all respect him even more. He was known as a great teacher even before I knew of his disability. He is now part of admin. 

I guess my point is, you might have to work harder and prove yourself at the beginning of each year, but if you can do it you could have a huge impact on your students. Once you can build up a reputation and relationship with the student body you shouldn't have many issues. "
highschoolteachers,"I have learnt to deal with the comments and just act with confidence so it becomes clear I'm a staff member. I'm training to teach in early childhood so it hasn't been too bad. 

Mostly it's confused looks from strangers if I'm walking around the area at lunchtime because they think I'm a local high school student who's wagging! But that's been happening for 6 years so I'm just used to it. 

I tried dressing up/a little older but I just have a baby face and looked like a tryhard. So I now just work on looking relaxed, confident and like I'm comfortable being somewhere to help me look like I fit in.

Hope that kinda helps!"
highschoolteachers,"I had this problem when I worked at a high school two years ago. I'm already short with a baby face. It doesn't help that the school has no dress code for students or teachers. There were several teachers with rainbow hair and tattoos and many girls show up to school in full face Instagram makeup and Kardashian outfits. I was stopped by security guards in the hallway asking me for a hall pass on a weekly basis until I introduced myself to every one of them. I had trouble with some students who simply wouldn't take me seriously (but they are clearly afraid of older looking teachers). However I had a much easier time with more mature students in advanced classes because they think I'm easy going and relatable. 

I work with severely disabled students in a middle school now so I don't really have this problem anymore. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach Civics to high school seniors. I talk about this election frequently with my students because, for many of them, this is the first time they can vote. I don't share my personal views on either candidate and try to be as unbiased as possible when explaining each candidate's platform. I have shown part of the first debate in class and even some of the VP debate. The students have shared with me their thoughts on the candidates and we've had interesting discussions. They aren't disrespectful towards differing opinions, and as long as that continues, I have no problem discussing the election. To me, it's been a very interesting way to get to know my students."
highschoolteachers,"Maybe I am biased, but I absolutely love the concept of CLEP tests.  They really have had my back when trying to fast-track through college and I had a lot of good experience with the tests.

I have never taken an AP class, but I know the concept really scared me as a high schooler.  I never thought I was smart enough for AP classes (and my grades sure weren't good enough) but heck yeah I can pass a test if I study for it.

I honestly don't really know how AP works in terms of colleges accepting it as credit--is it universal and all colleges accept it?  Because I know only certain colleges accept specific CLEPS.  My tech school accepted all of them, but when I transferred to a 4-year, there were a lot of CLEPs they didn't accept or had a significantly higher score needed for credit (instead of a 50, you needed a 64).  I always based my CLEPs on my 4-year school, so that wasn't a problem for me, but I could see that being a problem for students who don't know what school they are going to.

But overall, I love CLEP.  I think a course that teaches how to properly study for a CLEP exam could really apply to any CLEP and teach a student valuable self-study and self-teaching techniques.  That's how I'd run it if I were teaching it--show them the resources available, how to prepare, independent study techniques that could apply to any subject while helping them succeed on the CLEP at hand.

I mean, I've known several people who can pass a CLEP with only a few weeks of studying, and although the information may not necessarily stick forever (what year a certain legislation was proposed), it helps students knock out the ""boring"" gen eds and focus on the stuff they really like--or knock out the stuff they are already really strong in and don't want to waste a semester on--or knock out pre-requisites for classes they'd rather take.  

Unlike AP exams, CLEPs can be taken at any time time, students can take as little or as much time prepping for it, and colleges generally accept a whole lot of them (I was allowed to transfer up to 20 CLEPs if I wanted...).  

So yeah, I'm a fan, and I'd rather teach a CLEP prep class than an AP class, too, but I'm biased with limited AP knowledge."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; But they've figured out that I won't send 27 letters a day (I guess I should) and I can't punish only 3 of them or I'll get yelled at by parents.

Why won't you and why can't you? 

For classes like that in middle school (and these kids are barely high schoolers) I used to do whole class calls/emails every Thurs/Fri (positive and negative news). Worked like a charm after a few weeks of consistency (then back down to just calling the problem kids' parents). 

You have to pick something and stick to it EVERY time. That's really the key, especially with the younger or tougher kids.

The call during class idea someone gave is good, but it's hard for whole class misbehavior if the class is large... "
highschoolteachers,"Letting us fail. Freshman year of high school I was part of a new PBL department. I was one of 40ish students and 4 teachers. We had our own little building and it was all PBL style course work all day. Of course, we (students) had never seen anything like this. There was a group of 8 students, me included, who just excelled at it. It was really our cup of tea. We took off. Until...we got to our final project. I am a natural leader when it comes to stuff like this, but the department head teacher put another student in charge of the group. That student didn't know how to manage time or the rest of us kids. The project was a total bomb. It didn't even get 50% finished. At the time, 15yr old me thought the teacher was just ridiculous for not usurping the student leader. But letting us fail in that project taught me about working with others, time management, and real world skills. Which, those skills are probably more practical than learning about the top 100 people of the 20th century (project theme). 

As a beginning teacher, I had a problem with letting my little ones fail. I am much better now. I think about this high school project often.  I have to admit, my little ones have never come close to failing as hard as we did. LOL "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I look at my students and they are tired, stressed, and overburdened, and there's really nothing I can do about it because none of the other faculty seem to have a problem with it.

Guess what- your community college students felt the same way in high school. How they feel has nothing to do with your school. If it sucks so bad, they could go somewhere else. To blame your colleagues for being happy they get an extra two weeks off says a lot about you and your teaching style. Face it, you work at the college equivalent of a charter school for basic skills kids."
highschoolteachers,"We would like to draft you to our school....  Err, I mean, hire you.

Right now we have a former F/C from a Div I team, a 6'7"" power forward, a 6'3"" shooting forward, a former WNBA bench player at shooting guard, and I'm the point guard at a measly 5'9"".

We play in a basketball tournament versus the high schoolers and alumni.  We're undefeated in the first round, but we usually get tired by the second game, and lose the second game on purpose so that we can go home."
highschoolteachers,"What? No one thinks they are bad ass. Teachers restrict language so they don't suffer consequences from parents and administration. This is especially true for younger kids, so if you are not even in high school yet then yes teachers will try to not use curse words. "
highschoolteachers,"I have worked two districts (in Texas). The first was very large, very bureaucratic and made really poor decisions, but teachers had more sway. This is my second year in a smaller district, and I'm seeing the pain everywhere. 

Everything changes depending on where you are. It changes from district to district and school to school. Your mileage will also vary from elementary to middle to high school, and all areas in between. Some years are going to be awesome. Some might be utter bunk. Most probably won't stand out one way or another. 

Consider some things. How long do you have left to get certified? Do you feel like pursuing the certification (even if you move on to something else) is worth it? If you complete it, at least you'll have it, even if you don't use it.

Sorry if this come off as rambling. Good luck to you, and good vibes, whatever path you choose!"
highschoolteachers,"Ok, if you have 3 minutes to kill, watch this:
https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teacher-assessment-strategy

I know they're little kids in the video, but trust me, the method works for high school too (and adults as well) and any subject.

There are several keys to really make it work:
- It needs to be a daily routine. So that means in your daily plan, you know that you devote that last 5-7 minutes to this. It can't work if you don't get to it.

- It needs to be daily or almost daily to work.

- You need to make sure you're actually assessing for what they learned that day. It sounds silly, but I see teachers constantly giving exit tickets about stuff they didn't learn during that specific lesson - then there's no point.

- Notice how the teacher in the video reassures the students that it's not a big test. You say your students freak out about their grades. They need to know it will happen sometimes that they will bomb the exit tickets. And that's fine for two reasons: there are so many of them that their average will be barely affected by an occasional bomb - and also you're not weighing them the same as a regular test. It's totally OK to be transparent about them about the purpose of exit tickets. It's to measure what they learned that specific day to see what they understood, how much they understood, and what you need to re-teach (and it's ok to tell them something like ""sometimes I think I explained it well but I didn't and I'ld rather know sooner rather than later so I can re-teach you differently instead of everybody bombing the test"")

- Finally, and most critical: those exit tickets will reveal patterns of understandings and misunderstandings. It is crucial that you address the misunderstandings right away - as in the next lesson. Those exit tickets inform your instruction more than anything. They help you revise your plan and make sure students have strong foundations before moving on to new concepts that they'll be lost in. Reteaching is a difficult concept to handle for many teachers because of the pressure to cover X, Y, and Z in a limited amount of time. But trust me, and no admin in the world will go against it, a good teacher would rather have the teacher cover 80% of the curriculum with most students getting it than 100% of the curriculum with a bunch of students completely lost and having learned almost nothing all year."
highschoolteachers,"There is more to diversity than race. Three years ago our school also did a score breakdown based on 5 years of data to address the issue of girls scoring higher and finishing high school in higher rates than boys on average. Much, much higher. 80% retention in boys compared to 97% retention for girls. Our admin also broke the data down by location in and around the town, intending for it to be a representative of ""class diversity."" I don't know that we used this to alter our academic standards or expectations, we just wanted to understand. 

In my opinion, I don't teach math, I teach students. The better I know them, the better I can teach them. Of course I expect them to be responsible for their own education, but it doesn't hurt to gain some perspective on their performance by analyzing data. 

Having said that, I agree with you that the collegiate level as a whole is pandering way too much to diversity of skin color, and probably sacrificing a lot of academic integrity in the process. When a black student applying to Yale can be admitted over a asian applicant who got perfect scores on the ACT (Michael Wang) simply in the name of ""diversity""... something is wrong."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school teacher, so take that into account.  In my experience the first test of the year is the weakest test.  Students do not yet know how you test/grade, so don't yet know the best way to prepare.  I would imagine that if this is the first test your students have ever taken, this issue will be amplified.

I try to sell my first test as a fact-finding-mission for students.  they need to figure out what I'm up to and how to adjust their preparation strategy for test #2.  They get a grade, but it doesn't count for much."
highschoolteachers,"I was a student who had extreme anxiety and depression during high school. I would suggest that you just keep telling this student how great she is and how much you believe in her. It doesn't make the depression go away, but it does help lessen the force that the illness has over you. Maybe continue to make your classroom that safe space where she can shine. In time that will help her with attendance."
highschoolteachers,"I understand why you want to use rewards, but I think that the baseline idea that you are rewarding those who are already doing well is ignoring a REALLY big underlying problem:

If it feels like a reward to those that are already excelling, then to those that aren't, it feels like a punishment.  You are viewing it as ""less work for those that have earned it"" but for everyone else it's pretty easy to feel like you are punishing them for not showing mastery.  If you are giving those that aren't doing well, more work, and then saying you don't understand why they aren't motivated or interested, then I think you have a much bigger problem than a few unmotivated students.  You've built a structure in which you are punishing those students that probably need more praise or guidance than punishment.  Another kind of big problem with this, is that it's only October and some students are already showing mastery while others aren't, then you are really rewarding those that are coming to your class with a better background (whether that means study skills at home or general background knowledge) instead of rewarding those that have shown the most growth

Along with that, if you're only giving extra turns in games/competitions/etc, then you are telling those in the bottom half, ""I know this is harder for you, and I'm going to punish you for that.""  As a new teacher it's very easy to say, ""This student is unmotivated, I'm going to reward the others in an attempt to motivate them."" but what you are doing is creating a culture in which you are punishing those students and getting frustrated when they don't feel a need to succeed in your class.

I'm sorry if this comment sounds rude or belittling, but it really irks me when teachers ignore the fact that a ""reward for some"" really means a ""punishment for most"".  

One more edit:  I'm sorry but if you, the teacher, knows that the class is mundane, then kids being unmotivated is absolutely not their fault.  Being a young teacher is hard, but relying on prizes to make your class fun is a short-sighted solution to a long-term problem.  I would talk to other teachers in your building about what they've done that's been successful, and even talk to kids about classes that they love and see what you can bring from their favorite class to your own.  You are also in a unique position because high school wasn't that long ago.  Think about the teachers you really loved and what made you want to go to that class.  "
highschoolteachers,"That could be said for most things. But this is clearly a factor in OP's classroom. Therefore, it's pretty important. Teachers don't reach students by acting as if their issues are trivial. 

Edited to add: this is a huge issue at my girl's jr. high. But not so much at my older daughter's high school. I think it's a jr higher's attempt at 'finding themselves'. "
highschoolteachers,At my high school one teacher divorced his wife for a student.
highschoolteachers,"Administration micromanagement and bureaucracy can kill teacher morale worse than a 40-game losing streak in football and an explosion in the lab in the same week.

The track and field coach at my public school got in trouble for violating a rule on no physical contact with students, for administering first aid when the student got hurt.  Sure I understand why the rule was there in the first place, but there's clearly a difference between inappropriate contact and first aid.

Also my former school required us to put at least 10% essay questions on ALL exams, including math tests.  I tried to say that for high school math (geometry and above), all math problems are more or less essays (especially those requiring proofs), without the need for lengthy explanations as you might find in a mathematical journal, so essays weren't really appropriate, but they didn't buy it and said that I had to put questions which could be answered in ""paragraph form""."
highschoolteachers,"Female high school (9,10, and 12) Social Studies Teacher, first year, got a job almost 2 months after graduating. Had to bust my hump and be willing to commute an hour to get it. Most people in my cohort got jobs, I can only think of one exception (and he was a guy). My department is about equal in terms of male/female

Right now, I'm loving it. My performance is pretty standard for the subjects I teach, nobody think's i'm failing etc. It's good stuff. Well worth it"
highschoolteachers,"My high school English teacher was 6'3 or 6'4 and I never saw any disadvantages. We have a couple of teachers north of 6 feet where I work now, and it's not an issue as far as I can see. 

Plus, I'd love to have you at my current school during faculty/student basketball games!"
highschoolteachers,"My high school uses a freshman seminar that works VERY well. Of course, that doesn't help you, the classroom teacher. But it could help the school as a whole. The freshman seminar engages in study skills, homework help and tutoring, organizational skills, goal tracking, career study, Genius hour stuff, and some kind of A/R type reading (that's not A/R). The kids get really good organizational skills from it, and it probably is the biggest way they are set up for success. It's an elective credit, but it's basically mandatory unless a parent super complains (and they almost never do because it works so well). 

As far as strategies in the classroom... I cannot imagine 75% of my students with Ds... we probably teach different student populations.... but I really find it gets me more work back when I outline what will be due for a LONGER period of time (a week at least) and give reminders daily about turn-in dates, etc. Next day homework just doesn't work for me or many of my students, and I get why (they had a recital, a game, a birthday party, whatever). I require notice from my bosses, so I give it to the kids. For classwork, I set ""goal deadlines"" but take work until 3 days after the end of the unit (units are 2-4 weeks)---but the ""0"" goes in at the goal deadline to remind them, and they usually freak out when that happens and get a move on before the real deadline (and this is exactly the kind of shit I had to do when managing adults and do for MYSELF frankly, I think it's human nature). For assessments, there are firmer due dates (10% penalty each day if late, up to 5 days late), but the kids get extended notice (at least 1 week advance notice). I don't really give homework (except a tiny amount of Khan Academy Grammar) but rather give a lot of work, more than can be done in the work times given in class. Thus, students prioritize what they need help with during work times in class (which is not every day or the whole period) and then do at home what they feel comfortable with. Psychologically, it also helps because they see my class as having no homework and the assignments as just what they should have finished in class (""mwahhahah"" my plan!). 

I also use Remind (which they like) and make them put the assignments on their Google calendars (if Classroom doesn't add it automatically) because we're 1:1 and that's their planner. "
highschoolteachers,"Common Core and NGSS are very ambitious. I like their philosophy, and think their is great value in rethinking how we teach. There are two main problems, though:

1) It's different

2) People aren't being trained on it properly.

Since it's different, and different scares people (people still talk about ""new math"" even though we've been teaching ""New math"" since the 60s). So people freak out. But the way they approach early elementary mathematics I think is far superior to many of the old standards. 

Secondly, if you're not helping instructors learn how the new standards work, you're going to have a bad, bad time. It's a multi-year process to learn how to teach a totally new curriculum, and a lot of teachers weren't given that opportunity. So, mess ups happen.

But don't get me started on NGSS high school...."
highschoolteachers,"fuck that noise.  How about helping the students who haven't found an internship find an internship?  At least help them explore what they may want to intern as.

There's no way you'll keep a whole room of high school students quiet for three hours doing literally nothing.   They're going to socialize."
highschoolteachers,"The geography teacher in my high school had a daughter in my grade. She got placed in his class in grade 9 and he had her switched right away. It helped that we had multiple classes offered at the time, but he refused to have her in his class. Said he didn't want anyone thinking he was helping her more than anyone else "
highschoolteachers,"Most basic bio classes only very lightly skim both of these topics, or at least they did last time I was in a high school classroom. The advanced classes went more in depth, but the parents and students were aware of the expectations and content ahead of time, so we never had any trouble with parents. The more conservative folks tended to take the physics or chemistry courses to avoid those topics. 

I already have a lot of CYA habits built in from working in the medical field for a few years, so hopefully those habits carry over. 

Hopefully I don't end up having to hike to Maryland. The commute to get anywhere around here is bad enough without adding in a jump over state lines. "
highschoolteachers,"Jeese...there was a whole TIL about homework and depression.

Annoyed the shit out of me because most people just wanted to add their anecdotal experience to it...""Yah, I remember getting depressed because I had 4 hours of homework EVERY NIGHT.""

I swear to god I took Advanced and AP classes in high school. I had maybe 1-2 hours a night at most as long as I didn't procrastinate. I don't know if people are just lying, remembering incorrectly or just really stupid so it takes them 4 hours to do...

And I had my homework when you couldn't just google how to do a problem.

Anyways, I think 10 minutes or homework a grade level is a good guide. So if these are 9th graders then 90 minutes of homework isn't out of the question. They should be doing the same in middle school...70 minutes, 80 minutes. And they should somehow force consistency because I know some days students have zero homework and then homework is suddenly piled on another day. My school attempted assigning days that homework could be assigned by department, but it's difficult to do in a high school because then you have to separate out the Advanced/AP courses from the on-level as those courses will naturally have more homework.

Regardless, this middle school is ridiculous and you should stick to your guns. It seems like you've covered your bases. Maybe you can do a quiz over the homework every 2-3 days? ""Hey guys...I'm going to have a quiz in a couple of days on the homework I've collected up until then. If you do it then you'll already know how to do the quiz."" Sort of covers the bases...if they ""did"" the homework, but fail the quiz then you know they must be cheating. If they do well on the quiz, but don't turn in the homework then you know they are getting the material.

&gt; In one class alone I have probably 75% of my students have a D or lower due to incomplete work.

As someone else has pointed out--is the homework a large portion of the grade? In my classes the *most* I've ever counted homework was at 20% and this was *with* classwork and quizzes. Homework ended up being closer to maybe 4-6% of their grade overall. Not much, but enough for when it comes down to the final decision between an 89 and rounding to a 90. ""O' look...they have a homework average of 1%. Not rounding that..."""
highschoolteachers,"I just learned today that some middle schools ""reset"" student's grades every 9 months. Like every grading period students start with a 100. Learning this just now and I realize why kids come into high school thinking the same happens here.

""Uhh...no that 30 you got on the first test is following you *all* the way"". It also makes more sense why I have students that think they *can* fail at least 2 tests a semester **miserably** and then they are surprised to learn that they can't make an A or a B in my class."
highschoolteachers,"Don't worry. The same people who want to be martyrs will also be the ones who burn out and quit before you do. But I agree. The martyrdom is pervasive within the system and people use it to their advantage. For example, at the beginning of the school year, they overload all of my classes. I teach high school. I mean they go at least 7-8 students over each period. Then after the first two weeks, they ask you if it's okay. Uhm what? You knew the class size and how many the max is supposed to be. But you still overloaded me because you knew I'd be put in a bad spot if I said no and a bunch of kids will have to drop. They rely on that martyrdom and it works.  I hate looking like the bad guy. "
highschoolteachers,"Whoa! Yea older high school, calling home might work on the one kid, definitely not for the other kid. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school algebra.  I give out candy if a student gets an a on a test or if they catch me making a mistake on the board.  It works great.  The ironic thing is that I tried giving out ""Smartees"" but the kids prefer dumdums "
highschoolteachers,"Once had a kid expelled for most of the year for carrying an ornamental pocket knife his grandfather had given him in his backpack. The grandfather had recently died, and the kid was now living with his great grandmother and trying to function as an 8th grader. 

He finished 8th grade at a dayschool and came back to the district for high school. The high school allows small pocket knives so the knife that got him expelled from middle school wasn't even a problem in high school. 

We are a very rural area. I can bet that there are hunting guns in some of the trunks of vehicles in the parking lot right now. Expelling for a pocket knife is stupid. "
highschoolteachers,Wisconsin. In the past few years our governor has cut hundreds of millions from education while imposing more restrictions on unions and lowering the bar for teacher certification... like really low... like a high school dropout could legally teach my classes. I'm so glad I got that Master's.   It's been a trip. What system do you use? Or was it a homebrew?
highschoolteachers,"Suffice it to say yes! I teach both middle and high school in the Midwest and most definitely yes. 
My stories are that different from what I'm reading so I'll spare you "
highschoolteachers,"I am getting my degree to be an English teacher currently (only 2 more semesters to go!) and I have experienced this in my short time in the classroom. I had a 5th grader I was tutoring tell me he was afraid he was going to have to ""walk back to Africa"" if Trump got elected. 

I have had a group of white high schooler's attempt to have a trump rally at school and that entire day refer to African American students as ""boy"" and request they do things for them because ""We Are With Trump"" or something to that effect. Its terrifying. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach at the high school level and teach many classes with low functioning math students. What I've found works best is starting the lesson with a review from the day before (if it ties into the new material), a warm up that involves some prerequisite knowledge needed for the new material, and then the new material. With lots of guided then independent practice in each section. "
highschoolteachers,"No, you don't have to have lower-level (elementary) teaching experience to work your way up to high school.  First year teachers exist in all grades.  You would find student teaching extremely helpful though, and speaking as someone who started teaching high school juniors and seniors at age 21, you probably want a year or two of life experience first.  I regret not joining the peace corps out of college.  I would have been older and wiser.

History is a hugely saturated field.  Be prepared to move for a job and start somewhere less desirable.  Or sub for a few years.  Again, having the peace corps on your resume would be a nice boost.

I went to college and majored in History and Social Studies Education and graduated with a Bachelors in Education.  A couple of tests later and I was certified to teach.  The process varies by state.

I don't know what an MST is.  An MAT is a Master of Art in Teaching.  I have two MEds.  There's no real difference between an MAT and an MEd at my school.

Brush up on geography, economics, psychology, and politics.  Be rounded in everything that falls in the **social studies** category (rather than just US or World History).

Salaries vary by state.  You'll make way more in, like NJ, MA, MD, CA over a state like NC or FL.

Edit!  I just noticed your username.  Disregard all of this advice if you are in Ireland.  Your word choice made it seem like you were in the US so I made an assumption.  Sorry if that is incorrect."
highschoolteachers,"A lot of my students have gaps (high school science teacher), in either science, english or math.  I have structured my state standards into a KUD format. (Know-Understand-Do) This allows me to teach what they need to know in order to do what I need them to.  I think it's excellent to avoid teaching over thier heads!"
highschoolteachers,"It's too bad you left. 

I felt the same way. Then around year 5-6 kids would start coming back, or I would run in to them around the city, from the early years even, and tell me stories about their memories from high school. 

It just takes time for those stories to teach you. It's the great tragedy that the time it takes is greater than the average teacher's career. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm dealing with the same thing in my high school classes. It seems like special ed staff everywhere just have the habit of dropping off a high-needs kid with no support, supervision or even a check-in, and blaming teachers for not being ""patient"" or ""understanding the situation"".

You're right to be concerned about your tenure-related authority. Create a paper trail, and call as many meetings as you can reasonably afford with the objective of ""how can you help me, help him?"" Document the response. Call the parents. Talk to admin. Remember that the rule for special ed is the ""least restrictive, appropriate environment"" and that many people love to abuse this subjectivity to make their own jobs easier. If you can show the time and support invested in the child, the cost to other students, and the learning that has been produced (or not produced) after several weeks, I think you can expect/demand a straightforward articulation of their expectations. Is this babysitting? I've had to ask that before and sometimes they finally admit that yes, it is babysitting, and your job is damage control.

Have you/can you request a FBA for the student?  "
highschoolteachers,"I used to be you.  The ill health, the wishing something would happen so I didn't have to go to work.

I don't have a magic answer, as I'm still improving, but my major mistake (and possibly yours) is that I had no consequence in my classroom for poor behaviour.  (Hell, I NEEDED my lunch hour/interval.  I didn't want to spend it in detention myself!)

This creates a rod for your own back as the kids will just get worse and worse.

Think of some consequences - staying in at interval, contacting parents, sending them to a Dean, changing the seating plan.

You MUST follow through.

And the number of detentions I've handed out far exceed the number I have to attend myself.  What I mean is, often the little darlings won't turn up and it then goes to the Dean.

I am also a nice person who the kids take advantage of.  I spend time at home on sites where the children are described as little s**ts, and this puts me in a frame of mind where I can send them to the Dean and not fall for their sob-stories.

Things have improved markedly for me.  I'm not at the stage where I particularly look forward to seeing all of them, but it is MUCH better.  My stress levels are much lower, my mental and physical health is  improved, and I have the mental space to plan lessons instead of sitting shell-shocked at the end of the day.

EDIT:  90 minutes is a hell of a long lesson.  Set a routine where they know that they have to read silently when they've finished their regular work.  Have a stack of books they can read if they haven't brought one of their own.

EDIT2:  Some kids love to clean the blackboard, or hand out books.  Use this to your advantage.  And blatantly use rewards to elicit good behaviour.  I've just finished a two week holiday, and been doing reflection; although I've got consequences, I've not yet instilled rewards for good behaviour.  It can be as simple as ""Good job, Fred"" if they've got their book out.  Should be unnecessary and part of a high school student's routine, but with my class...!  And then better rewards for working hard.  Be careful, it can get expensive very quickly, so find a supply of free stuff (eg pens/promotional material) and do them up nicely in cellophane or something."
highschoolteachers,"I'd let it go and only contact the teachers if your kid brings home a test with correct answers marked wrong. You're not in the class. The teacher could be going over the ""irregularities"" with the students. 

To be honest if a parent emailed me about questions they had with what the text said I'd wonder if they were doing their child's homework for them and I'd start looking at the work more closely. 

But I'm in high school. Maybe things are different in ms. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach Business Ed. in high school. In another life I would LOVE to be a PE teacher. If I didn't love my gig so much, I would go for it in a heartbeat. 

When my students disparage their PE teachers by asking things like, ""Why do THEY make as much as a ""normal"" teacher?!"" I sincerely reply that PE might be the best investment that the government is making in them. I don't think it is far fetched to think that personal health improvements will have the greatest RoI as we age into the Medicare generation. 

On a much less serious note (but still kinda serious)-- you get to wear comfy clothes every day, you get to work out at work, your lesson planning and grading is significantly less than every other discipline (I liken it to assigning a large project: a day or two of direction and then multiple days of floating and assisting).

Go for it!"
highschoolteachers,"Demo lessons and long processes are the norm at some of the public districts around here, especially in the 'burbs. There is a ton of competition for jobs here (Ohio) that I know some other states don't have, so I imagine they create more and more hoops as they get more applications. I didn't have to do any of that (other than the personality test bit!) but I work in an urban district. A former coworker of mine had to do three interviews and two demo lessons to get one of the suburban gigs, and she said there were hundreds of applications, and this was just for a high school math position.

But, yeah, the ""management"" thing set off a million warning lights for me. This sounds like a really bizarre school, and certainly not a place I'd want to stay at long term. Sounds like OP dodged a bullet."
highschoolteachers,"They need to stop giving a fuck about test scores! I had to teach a senior in high school how to find Africa on a map. I don't even teach social studies. 

Test scores are not indicative of a satisfactory education. Nor are they indicative of an intelligent child. They're just really good at filling in bubbles on tests that matter way more for us than for them. Some of them don't even read the test because they know they'll pass and graduate regardless. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school in an urban Ohio school system. I personally believe that the income is decent, especially given that we work 180 days of the year and have excellent benefits (at least in Ohio). That said, I do agree that teachers are generally underpaid. Yea, we get summers, but I spend 3-4 hours after school everyday devoted to working on lessons/grading and it's extremely stressful (at least for the first year). Also most new teachers end up in settings that not only pay the least, but have some of the more challenging classrooms. Overall I would say that if it's something you want to do and will enjoy, there is no better career. I have no problem living off what I make as a first year teacher even with the student loan payments. "
highschoolteachers,"Darnell?  Am I close?  I already graduated from high school, so it's ok.  You can tell me."
highschoolteachers,I am so glad Facebook did not exist when I was in high school.  Partly because of Mean Girls stuff like this and partly because I do not want documentation of all the stupid stuff I thought was cool back then.
highschoolteachers,"Someone's sister told Margo's girlfriend that Margo was cheating on her with her ex. Then Greg said ""I have to have a relationship with some drama I'd be so bored otherwise.""
I lost my shit and said ""that's so high school."""
highschoolteachers,"I am a textbook introvert and a physics teacher. I teach high school juniors (mostly). It works quite well for me.

Obviously, I spend all day interacting with the kids, but that type of interaction is a bit different (energy-wise) than dealing with adults. There is a clear purpose and structure to our interactions, so it's not like trying to make small talk with strangers all day.

Honestly, I spend a lot of time recharging alone in my classroom during my prep and after school. Teaching can be a surprisingly isolating profession at times, despite its obvious social aspects. I try to eat lunch with friends as opposed to alone in my classroom as an intentional effort on my part to build and maintain relationships, as otherwise it's almost too easy to just be alone (even with other people around...). 

"
highschoolteachers,"""Seems""? LOL Ok. *Seems*....

You're in that ""I want every student to like me"" phase. Not a good place to be. ""A positive but professional connection""? You're kidding yourself. She's flirting with you and you've had enough concern to discuss it with admin. Maybe you didn't get enough attention from the opposite sex when you were in high school and now you're caught between liking this girl's interest in you and ""trying"" to deal with her in a professional manner. You should have shut this girl's flirting down when it first started by making yourself less available to her (or even setting clear boundaries) but you obviously didn't want to. And now you've got to deal w/ it. Start to distance yourself. When she walks in your room, leave, and say you have a meeting and don't have time to talk. Surely you have some skills in brushing people off who you have no interest in. Use them. Use all of them.

Make sure that you develop a habit of not shutting the door to your classroom when it's just you and a female student. "
highschoolteachers,"Let me start with this: I'm a high school math teacher in a title 1, rural school and I only teach the lowest level of student. My best class is a collab class with about 8 IEP students and a revolving door of low level students that transfer around while their parents work different minimum wage jobs.

I was tired of the ""shotgun approach"" and students not working due to a high level of performance anxiety. They wouldn't complete anything unless they felt that they fully understood the topic, which is difficult with any new topic if you don't try.

So I made a huge decision to ""release"" the responsibility that wasn't really mine by transitioning my students into semi-self paced learners. I say ""semi"" because of how I've structured the pacing. I may not be the right kind of motivational person to be a teacher, but I know that the students aren't going to work on learning something difficult unless there are incentives for them to keep moving. My students can sit where they like as long as they're making forward progress. When they aren't, I sequester them from their friends by having them come up front as one of my VIPs. They want to get out of it and back with their friends ASAP.

It's the best thing I've ever done. Combined with a good online LMS that I can structure to give loads of feedback, my student grades on similar assessments compared to previous years is through the roof. I find that my students want to succeed because they know that with enough effort, they can earn that grade they want. The biggest drawback that I'd give is that I'm often frustrated with pacing, but that's on me and I find myself paring away any extra that isn't really focused on the task at hand so that we can cover the curriculum.

I find that I must be ok with a certain level of chaos, and that's hard coming from a traditional education college. My profs weren't the type to encourage this level of innovation that my students love. And they do love it. While they may not be math lovers, they will at least be math achievers by the end of the year, and maybe that's enough.

Good luck! Count your blessings in that you work at a place that allows for such work. Your students will prosper for your innovation and hard work."
highschoolteachers,"Hey! I'm currently rocking the best of both words between being a student teaching intern &amp; a senior in high school. I've been in classes with all of the things you mentioned in your post. I would say don't do a flipped classroom, because every single time I've seen it and experienced it, it was AWFUL. Students are lazy unfortunately and most of them will not actually pick up on the material too well if they're doing it at home. In my class, everyone skipped through the videos just looking for the answers instead of working. Although, I'll say the mindfulness concept really succeeded in the class I was in. My teacher went over reasoning behind learning it and how to actually mediate. It ended up working out really well and all of us felt a lot better after meditating."
highschoolteachers,"I had a parent call me at HOME and tell me that she couldn't figure out the biology problem I had given her son.

I didn't have the nerve to ask if she was hoping to earn a high school diploma, or if this was for her son."
highschoolteachers,"On your worst day you may be a child's best hope. 
I teach high school. The roughest kids come back to visit. They probably needed me the most. Even though I am a mediocre teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"Every day for 2 weeks I have been listening to a table group of 8th graders debate about what classes to take next year, if they should do AP or IB, which teachers they should try and get, blah blah blah.  I called them out on it today and asked them if they were afraid of high school and they all looked at me sadly and nodded. Poor babies :)"
highschoolteachers,"I've had a few English teachers, at the high school and middle school levels, complain because it's leading to students that can't spell properly due to not knowing the various sounds letters are supposed to make.  ""Creative"" spelling by parents is literally hurting the education of their kids."
highschoolteachers,"convinced a ceramics teacher and a spanish teacher to give me a ride home in high school. I was lazy as fuck...

given a ride home to a boy one time because his dad couldn't pick him up on time. dad was a firefighter and school board member. 

but... not now. it ain't happening. I have a much more mature and professional attitude about my career now. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, but came in here to tell you that the current drama in my kid's 3rd grade classroom is who is deciding to go to A's birthday party or not, and if they are going just because it's at an awesome bounce house or if they actually like A.

Also, when I asked my kid about poor A, he knows nothing about her except, ""Well, she has hair."" So, he's definitely on the bounce house side."
highschoolteachers,"Syntax is crucial to a lot of forms of writing. The degree of precision in syntax becomes higher stakes in college level or higher level academic writing (not so much high school level academic writing per se, though it matters some there; I would consider college entry-level English/Comp classes at the high school level, frankly), technical writing, and -- for entirely different reasons -- narrative writing. 

If she is what I'd consider a ""purist"" for academic writing, the key to correct syntax is to -- while following all the other ""rules"" like active voice and grammatical constraints -- be clear, brief, and as clinical/technical as possible. This would not necessarily be as true in a literary examination as it would be for academic writing in most areas, to be fair. I found that in other disciplines, outside of literary circles, there is much less flair and it feels more similar to technical writing (though not the same). Of course, she may have an entirely different preference. I'm guessing wildly, to be clear. 

The example you gave doesn't really suit the question you're asking, unfortunately, and which one is ""better"" isn't really a question that makes sense out of context. So, that's why I can't answer. Which one is better? Better for what? The key to style is suiting the style of the task. So, yes, different iterations of the idea have different value, but as to which is ""better,"" it's impossible to say without consideration of the task. 

For expression on a message forum? There's no ""right"" answer here, as this is entirely subjective (no rubric, no common guidelines, grammar errors abound on message forums like reddit, so judging which ""syntax"" is better seems arbitrary here). Though I would say:

&gt;Which, I admit, is quite vague. 

This was probably the most appropriate one for the context, in terms of voice conveyed, though I think it would work better attached to the sentence than as a fragment. It feels a bit jarring. 

&gt;Which is quite vague, I must admit

The ""I must admit"" has a weird Scarlett O'Hara thing or sounds mildly sarcastic somehow. 

&gt;I admit it is quite vague

This is okay, but it feels less conversational and unfinished, like you were going to say ""but..."" and add something. 

&gt;It's vague, I know

This also feels in need of a follow up. 

&gt;I know it's vague

As does this. 

&gt;Vague, yes it is

This is extremely awkward syntax that sounds like a bad translation from another language. 

&gt;Yes it is vague

Again, feels in need of a follow up. And the ""yes"" feels out of place alone. 

But that's an entirely subjective take that has no bearing on the discussion of academic syntax and your paper, really. "
highschoolteachers,"No joke, where I grew up the bridal salons and formal stores would record what high school you went to when you bought a dress and not sell it in that color to anyone else from the school.  Department stores didn't, though, so you just had to take your chances."
highschoolteachers,"I work a medium size public high school. A large group of seniors are going on a ""senior cruise"" (parents are apparently going to). All I hear about is students complaining about their friend, who is going, blah blah blah. "
highschoolteachers,"I have some materials from a high school level. I can send you them if it would help you, but the material would need to be revised a lot for 8th grade."
highschoolteachers,"Hey man,
I'm a first year biological science teacher this year as well. At the start of this week it dawned on me how exhausted I was and how difficult this job can be. Last year as a student teacher I saw kids daily and taught lessons, but never had them so many months in a row. The key is to take a breath, take it slow and know that you're doing the best job you can. 

My suggestion for finding new curricular materials is to go back to the standards for the class. If you dont have any standards, check out what they'll learn in physical science classes in high school and dumb the material down a bit.  I've even looked at other state's standards to see what they're doing (NY standards are pretty good). Maybe give them an open ended inquiry-based project where the students need to request materials from you the teacher, or even petition the administration on the class' behalf.  

Just go one day at a time and don't dump on yourself but no matter what you do for the rest of this year the kids are going to learn and they'll be ok. "
highschoolteachers,"Nope! I was in a high school as well. Of course many had MA and three PhDs, but half or so Judy had BSs or BAs. "
highschoolteachers,"I have one student who I always dread her essays and save them for last. She's overly wordy. Just because there is a list of words in the thesaurus doesn't mean you should use all of them. She circles around the point without actually making it. I do try to stay fair though and a rubric, handed out ahead of time, helps with that. Perhaps when you meet with your professor you can ask for a copy of the rubric and follow it next time.

Since it's your second semester and you got an A in English first semester I'm more surprised. However college is very different from high school, and expectations are higher. I got As all through HS and Cs my first semester of college. My writing just wasn't on par with my new classmates. This may be the case for you, in which case I'd suggest a visit to the writing lab (if your school has one) or the TA or even the professor herself with your complete paper about a week before it's due. See what feedback you can get. "
highschoolteachers,"Well, we had a sub today (in a different type of schedule than traditional high school) fall asleep on the couch next to two sophomores. Anytime she wasn't asleep, she read her book or played video games. I don't think she spoke to a single student the entire day. "
highschoolteachers,"Check out the BBC series called The Crimson Field. I also teach high school in an isolated, rural area, and this is the second year I've shown Episode 1 during the WWI unit. It gets the viewer pretty emotionally involved; lots of kids love it and beg to watch more, even ones that aren't usually into much of anything we do in class.  It's a fictional/scripted TV show, not a documentary, but it's extremely rich in depictions of major WWI issues - shell shock, the hyper-patriotism, militarism, and shaming of anyone who showed fear, etc. It's set in an army field hospital in France in 1915, and the main characters are volunteer Red Cross nurses newly arrived from Britain. The first episode follows their first day on the job. There are a couple of mildly inappropriate parts, but it's really not too bad at all, and very easy to silence/block the screen if you want to be extra cautious. "
highschoolteachers,I am realizing I'm thinking more of high school because that is what I teach so I bet you're right!

highschoolteachers,"Copied my post from a different thread:


School librarian here, I also lurk r/Libraries but I feel like I can relate here more often. So this week an elderly man came by to the high school library. At first I thought he was a technician coming in to repair our security gates because he carried a large briefcase. He sat at the study tables for about two hours, so I assumed he was a student. Our school has an ESL adult division, so I let it slide even if I considered asking the man if I could see his student ID. Before he left, the man handed me an envelope and told me,""This is the final language of the world,"" and encouraged me to recruit others on his behalf. The envelope contained gibberish, it didn't resemble any recognizable language. I called another staff member in for help, possibly identifying an intruder. It turns out he is a supply teacher. And after sitting down with the VP, he still went on to supply a class anyway for the day. ALL MY WAT. 

"
highschoolteachers,"I also teach high school freshman! I would love to hear more about how your experience got better after your first year. I'm hoping it will (and people tell me it will), but it's still kind of hard to imagine right now. Would love any insights you can share!"
highschoolteachers,"Agree, but...I guess we have to be the change and all, right? 

Today, I tried a new way of teaching economic theory in my high school econ class (Brooklyn NY). It was all student-led, very little direct instruction, and I was/am nervous it will be a disaster. But, 2 classes in so far, and it's been really rewarding. Plenty of ""wrong"" answers, but I'm excited by how clever and inventive student work has been already. 

I recently quit a higher-paying job to come back to teaching high school history at a public school in central Brooklyn, and I couldn't be happier. Teaching is a great job! "
highschoolteachers,"That's exactly the expectation/hope I have about it. I was an at risk student from a poor family of addicts and high school dropout, too. I've got more empathy than I know what to do with haha. "
highschoolteachers,"In like ten years, I've only had no plans left once or twice. My school district basically uses all the same curricula in the elementary schools, so once you get used to that, it's easy to figure out what to do. Also, most teachers in the same grades work together on what's going on, so you can always ask the neighbor teacher. 

Sure, of course leave a note. But I have never understood subs who leave long narratives for the teacher. I am very utilitarian. We did XYZ that you expected; X kid refused to work and was disruptive in X way; there wasn't enough time to accomplish X... Honestly, you don't need to write a novel. It looks like ass-kissing. (So I guess if you're angling for a job at that school, maybe okay, you need to kiss ass. I don't.) 

Elementary is easier on the soul, because they're usually not mean to you as a sub until about Fourth Grade. Then things get dodgy. Middle school and high school can be difficult because they can be rude/ mean, but the work is easier, because repetitive and they're in and out--and you get a free period, usually.) So basically, there will usually be one or two ""bad classes"" where they are disruptive/defiant. Your job is not to take it personally, stay the course, don't get angry, and write down names of kids who are really bad news. After many years, I have basically made it a policy of dealing with all discipline issues myself, rather than getting involved with the office. Basically, until they know you, it's not worth it to make others deal with your discipline problems. Time out chairs for the littles, talking to them about what's going on, and with older students, simply informing them that any misbehavior will be passed on to their teacher. Generally, with older kids--they don't know you, and they don't care about you, and getting into power struggles tends to be a big mistake. Getting angry is also a big mistake. Yelling is a mistake. 

Presumably you know how to use a smartboard. Many teachers will leave their plans on a drive plugged into the computer to use. Most will leave clear directions. So basically, your job is to figure out and follow directions. Getting to school when you're supposed to makes that most possible. (Sometimes teachers are disorganized or unclear, so it sometimes takes a while to figure out where everything is.) I don't carry ""extra work"" with me to do, but instead find short entertaining educational videos that are relevant to the work they're doing that day. Or if they're small, read a book to them. A bit of entertainment from a sub makes things go smoother, in my opinion. (You're a sub--it's better to be the ""fun sub"" who gets everything accomplished and gives them a ""treat"".) I use thekidshouldseethis.com for kid-friendly but smart shorts. (Be careful of Youtube. The ads or other videos can be wildly inappropriate and cause disruption.) 

Honestly, the most important thing to remember is that you're simultaneously the lowest rung on the totem pole (and so be careful of offending the other staff), and also the most desired person in the building, because most school districts pay for shit and there is a sub shortage. So they simultaneously disrespect you and want to make you want to come back. It's weird. If you can find a school you like, have a card you can give to certain teachers so they can request you. I have kept a blacklist for years of classrooms and teachers I will never teach for again, and I refer to it. My district is big enough that I have no problem getting jobs either way.

In my state (Minnesota), there are two types of licenses: short call sub (which covers k-12 all subjects, but you can't work more than two weeks in any specific job) and subject specific (in which you can replace someone in your area of expertise if they drop dead or something). If you want to get called for jobs every day, have a short call license, because there are lots of subjects that suffer for lack of subs (like special ed, business or graphic design or phy ed). They try to tell you that turning down jobs on the call system will penalize you in the algorithm. I have found that at least in my district, this is not the case, and I turn down far more jobs than I take. No big deal. Be picky, and be happier. 

Most importantly, don't let the assholes get you down. The biggest advantage of being a substitute is being able to take days off whenever you want. Remember that they need you, desperately. Be competent, and do your best, but don't let mistreatment on the part of students or staff get you down. Just walk out of that building at the end of the day and don't come back until you've forgotten what was so depressing. You have choices, so don't forget to use them. "
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher in an alternative environment, the biggest surprise was just how much the students end up loving you, even for being tough on them. Not to mention how much they keep coming back, just to see me. 
I guess being the only ""real"" adult 'role model' in their life really does go a very long way. "
highschoolteachers,"When you have runners in special ed it's terrifying. I lost a runner for 15 minutes on a high school campus. I had to have 10 minutes quiet time after that because my heart was racing so fast. The kids have no sense of danger, no situational awareness. Some think it's a fun game to hide. Some can run for miles. They run in front of cars without thinking. They wander into bodies of water when they can't swim. They find a hiding place and think they will be in trouble so they stay hidden.  Hundreds of kids who elope die each year because they run away from caretakers when their backs are turned. "
highschoolteachers,"I was the same way in high school. I loved grading my favorite teachers' papers in Spanish because it was almost like extra practice. She was the reason I decided to study Spanish K-12 teaching in college! I like knowing it does help, I wish I could continue to help out during college so she'd be less stressed."
highschoolteachers,"What surprised me most was how little some kids care about what I think of them. I know that sounds really arrogant, but growing up, I cared so much about my teachers' approval. A nasty look would make me feel guilty for days. Now I'm starting to realize that I was the abnormal one, and I wish I had been more relaxed in high school. At the same time, however, there a few kids that I wish would give a shit about my opinion. "
highschoolteachers,"We're in similar situations, I'm a sophomore at a state college and want to be a social studies teacher, too. Depending on the atmosphere of your school, you might get a ton of shit for wanting to be a teacher (especially social studies) so ignore the assholes and always remember the real reasons you want to be a teacher. I can't answer any of your questions but good luck finishing high school and starting college!
"
highschoolteachers,"I do participation points in a purely punitive manner. They are worth 5% of the grade, and most students get all of the points. I wouldn't do them at all, but I work with very unmotivated kids in a bottom tier private high school.  Before I implemented participation points, I would have students disappearing into the bathroom for 15 minutes at a time and constantly forgetting things in their locker.  Now, I make a big show of marking it in my grade book when they do these things, and the theatrics keep them in line.(Though if they ever stopped to calculate it out, they would realize how inconsequential those points are.)"
highschoolteachers,I still love how students will just up asking if they can pass things out for you. I teach high school too. You'd think they'd be over that stuff.
highschoolteachers,"How much their relationships affect them. Dad lost his job or mom overdosed? Not phased at all. Bf/gf breaks up with them? Be prepared for tears. As someone who never dated in high school, this still surprises me."
highschoolteachers,"If the custodian is game for it (and prepared in case it goes poorly), maybe do a get-to-know thing with one of the friendlier janitors for the classroom, where you can ask him about his life and then open up for a quick Q&amp;A. 

When I was in high school my mom dated our custodian and he was an awesome dude, so every time people left trash around or tried to pull a big prank I shut that shit down fast. "
highschoolteachers,"""ContentFarmer, decisions are being made by boards of testing companies and state departments of education alike. When they realize that there is no possibility of retreating back into more sensible policies without having to admit that they have fucked the education system, there will be only one course of action open. Total commitment.""

In all seriousness, though, I think the problem is even more amplified by the College Board and the entire ""resume arms race"" taking place in recent years. We tell our students to load up on extracurricular activities, while taking at least three AP classes per year starting in sophomore year, achieve perfect scores in all their classes, test and retest on the SAT/ACT/SAT II's/etc in the hope of getting all their scholarships together to attend their Dream School. Because, apparently, if they do not attend their Dream School, then their life is worthless and they will never have the ability to be happy.

Oh, and then we throw on that they should also try to ""enjoy high school while it lasts, because it's the best years of their lives."" Gee... if they really internalized that they were going through this hell, and thought that *this* would be the happiest they'd ever be in their lives, maybe this starts to explain some of the teen suicide, depression, and anxiety problems we're seeing in schools.

Meanwhile, going to an affordable, mid-level college is probably more education than many of their peers will ever get, because somebody has to be a mechanic, plumber, electrician, sanitation worker, custodian, etc, and these jobs do not typically require a college degree. What's more, they'd probably be happier and able to afford their loans, versus graduating with $30K, $50K, even $100K or more in student loans.

We're teaching them to want nothing but the best for themselves, because we think they need ""the best"" in order to be happy. It turns out, the generic brand can make them just as happy for much less grief, effort, and money. Who knew.

Anyway, you're definitely onto something. I wish there were more journalists covering issues in education; when I tell the story of NJ DOE's commissioner and one of the testing companies affiliated with the PARCC exam to non-teaching friends, their eyes immediately go bug-eyed. They *know* it's a problem. They *know* that if they listened to the advice of teachers and other experts pointing out the problems, maybe things would have gone differently. But our conversations with friends and family do not at all equate to the spotlight of a major newspaper breaking stories day after day.

Bah. I'm too cynical for my age, maybe.

highschoolteachers,Paint is black was the song my teacher used when we were in high school. Worked well for us.
highschoolteachers,"&gt; If you complained about schoolwork being ""boring"", adults would roll their eyes and tell you to pipe down and get back to work.

To be fair, this is basically still what I do. But I searched far and wide for decent admin, a good school community, and I teach high school where this is less of a problem (though still a problem with the standard level kids; the pre-AP Honors kids get it). 

And you know what? I get better results all around (every metric of learning) when I do this than when I used to kill myself to make everything ""fun"" because my principal expected it. "
highschoolteachers,I think I had my head in the desk like 50% of the time in high school.  It just helped me focus on what I was reading.
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I'm not looking forward to the long stretch of classes until that time.  The plus side is that I work in an alternative high school, and we change our class schedule up every 6 weeks, so after the first week in April, the pace will change up for me a little bit.  Still a long damn time without a significant break."
highschoolteachers,"Completed. My school is 1-to-1 (every teacher and student has a laptop) so technology is big for us.

One suggestion: Many middle/high school teachers don't just teach exclusively one grade level, especially us language teachers. I'd consider allowing multiple grade levels be selectable."
highschoolteachers,"I moved from NC to CO last summer! I'm in the Denver-area and competition for jobs here (even in science) is much more intense than in NC. I'm not sure where you live in NC, but I have a lot of friends who were basically able to walk into a school with no teaching experience and be hired as lateral entry teachers in STEM positions. Some were fresh out of college and didn't even have other work experience.

If you want to move to Colorado, you need to start looking for teaching jobs now. The big districts will be posting them soon if not already. Every school I interviewed at last spring asked me for either a teaching video or to come in and teach a demo lesson. I still found a job, but it paid less (charter school) and wasn't in my preferred subject/age range (I prefer high school bio but this was middle school science). Perhaps more rural areas would be more open to hiring lateral entry teachers?

If you're open to charters, DPS in Denver has a ton. Several of my colleagues at the charter school had no teaching experience or license. You need to be ""highly qualified,"" which for 7-12 science means you're licensed, you've passed the general science PRAXIS, or you've taken at least 24 hours of relevant science classes. Charters would be your best bet for teaching without a license, but as far as I know they don't offer a lateral entry program that leads to a license. Some charters also have teaching fellow positions where you train for a year before teaching your own classes. I had a license when I was applying, so I don't know a lot about the requirements for those positions.

I'm not sure how much it costs, but a few of my colleagues and my old boss are getting master's degrees from the RELAY program. For people without a license, you get placed as a teaching fellow (not a lucrative position, but the pay is better than nothing) for your first year. The second year you'll teach your own classes and wrap up coursework. 
Edit: I looked it up and you'd need to be offered one of the teaching fellow positions at a charter school first, then you can apply to the RELAY teaching fellow MAT program.

If you were asking in November instead of March I'd tell you to apply to the MAT program at Duke. They have several fellowships including one from the NIH that will pay for your master's degree. The payback requirements vary, but usually you just need to teach in an at-risk public school district for two years. 

 "
highschoolteachers,"I got my first teaching license in Colorado so I can speak a little about the requirements of a license from there and the steps that I took to get it. I took the traditional pathway (university degree in my subject + certification and student teaching from my university's school of education) whereas a relative of mine took the alternative pathway (teaching &amp; getting your education credentials at the same time).

If you're more interested in the alternative pathway option--which it sounds like you are--then you should first be looking around for job postings. In order to get into an alternative pathway program, you firs have to be hired on as a teacher. Schools are/will soon be posting their job openings. Most will be posted by spring break time.

Instead of contacting the universities, I would contact the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) with your questions as they'll be more readily knowledgeable about your options. Their website is also pretty easy to navigate and understand. Here is a good start: https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdeprof/altteacheroverview

There is usually a demand for science teachers and if you look on teachers-teachers.com (a good job search site) there's quite a lot of science postings for Colorado. However, be prepared to teach all aspects of science and not just earth science. Some districts may have earth science specifically in the middle schools instead of high schools so you might consider that grade level as well.

If you're interested in the traditional pathway, I can tell you about that as well. The content area exams really aren't that bad and Colorado doesn't demand as many tests as my current state (WA) where I'm having to take six tests despite my degree and my CO license."
highschoolteachers,"True. I did start off subbing, however, and quickly found out that I liked elementary aged students. I originally thought I wanted to teach high school! I'm glad I found that out by subbing both of them for a few weeks (and then transitioning to only taking elementary jobs for my remaining time) rather than getting stuck in a para job that maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed for a whole year. I enjoy the flexibility of subbing for that reason. But...if you have an idea of what area you might like, it's not a bad idea. I just had never worked with high schoolers before, so I wasn't sure. Subbing was great to help me decide!"
highschoolteachers,"We had a speaker talk about bullying when I was in high school in the early 2000s. The presenter told us to use the phrase ""Hey now!"" to assert ourselves when we didn't like something that was said to us. Everyone mocked it for weeks. When my German teacher gave us directions for classwork, one of my classmates routinely said ""Hey now!"". Even my German teacher laughed. "
highschoolteachers,"I moved from NY to MA to teach. Here's some good things to know:

* You won't be able to teach until you've taken all of the teaching exams (they are specific to Mass, unlike the Praxis). 

* There's different ""pathways"" to getting Mass licensure: sounds like you already have an out-of-state approved teaching program of study, but you may need to do a ""practicum"" (aka student teaching all over again) in MA.

* You don't need 3 years teaching experience prior to hire- my first teaching job ever was in Mass. 

* You will need an SEI endorsement. There's a test you can take to grant you this endorsement without taking the official course, but you REALLY have to study and prepare to pass it if you take it without an SEI course. I earned my endorsement this way.

* Your area of interest (high school/middle school science) is an area of need, you'll probably have more luck finding a job than others. 

Massachusetts is the pickiest state when it comes to teaching requirements, and your best bet is to call the Licensure call center in Malden at 781-338-6600. While you wait to meet all your requirements, I'd recommend looking for a sub position in a public school. Your other option is charter schools, but I'd *strongly* recommend not going down that path. I worked as an assistant in a preschool while I finished my requirements."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a special education high school teacher in Oakland California.

That's awesome if you already know how you want to do that. Special Education takes a lot of patience and a lot of communication and being able to work with others. You clearly have pretty good communication skills already by the way.

Special education falls under multiple categories and you will have to pick one eventually. 

Mild/ moderate is typically students with ADHD, behavioral issues, hearing and vision issues, ETC.

This is what I do. I am in the general education classroom 1 out of the 4 periods in a day and co-teach. Then I work in the resource/ pull out room for 1-2 periods working in small groups with students. Then I co-plan with my co-teachers and/or work on IEPs (long documents to prepare for meetings with students and parents about how to help special ed students succeed.)

Moderate/ Severe- autism spectrum, down syndrome, etc...
This generally looks involves the special ed teacher with several aides and specialists with the same group of students all day. You still do IEPs and the focus is more on life skills. At the high school level these students can go to school until they are 21 so you may have the same students for 7 years. In elementary school you have them for the elementary school years and i'm not sure about middle school.

There are also behavior intervention teachers (a separate class with students with severe behavior issues)

There are speech pathologists (students that need speech therapy) and other jobs."
highschoolteachers,I taught AVID for 4 years and had a girl with a .9 GPA her freshman year turn it around and get a 4.0 her senior. She found her passion working with ESL students and now works with me at the high school in helping those freshmen who are in a similar situation as her to turn their lives around as well.
highschoolteachers,"Student teaching is extremely difficult but also can be extremely helpful. For me the biggest thing is about being honest to students (i teach high school). If a lesson doesn't go well, reflect on how it could have been better, ask for help from people at your school and reteach it. Remember, students know what school is supposed to be like already. Don't be afraid to call home or discipline the students. They will test you so just know that they likely know what they did is wrong (unless they are in first grade or lower) and they will probably respect you more after you follow through."
highschoolteachers,"I teach and coach at a high school with a very large ESOL population, mostly Hispanic. One of my athletes/AP Calc students will be the first in his family to go to college. I wrote his letter of rec and was the first person he told when he was accepted. This is my second year teaching and it's still really stressful, but stuff like that just makes it all worth it."
highschoolteachers,"Alright.  

Job prospects are good.  We need science teachers.  Are you willing/able to teach something other than biology?  Chem?  Physics?  The more you are certified to teach, the better.  But biology is 1,000 times better than if you were certified to teach history or English.

You will need to take the MTELs.  You will, at the least, have to take the Literacy &amp; Communication (or called similar) and the Biology one.  If you think you can pass another science, go for it.  

You pass the MTELs and you have your masters I think you can actually apply for your initial, over your preliminary.

The SEI endorsement is new.  I've been teaching 11 years in MA and I don't have it.  I *just* renewed my license (good for five years) in January of this year.  Because they just rolled out the SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) in the last few years, they're trying to get everyone certified.  New graduates take a class and they're set.  Current teachers take a class and they're set -- but they're offering the classes first to teachers at schools with ELL populations.  My school doesn't have any (on record - we have them but they choose not to identify) so we're low priority.  I can't get into a class - yet.  In order to renew, I needed 15 hours in an ELL course, so I took something online over the summer to get the hours so I could renew.  I have to take the course in the next five years in order to renew, but because I am still in that grey area where current teachers aren't yet certified, I was okay to renew and my school was okay with that.  It's a requirement, but depending on the school, not necessarily a deal breaker.

Alternatively, you could take the SEI MTEL.  I had a friend do that.  She passed, but I heard it's a pretty low pass rate.  You could always try.

Take the MTELs.  Apply for licensure. Preliminary or Initial, it won't matter.  You'll end up with your professional in five years.

I graduated with a bachelor's and an initial license.  I have a coworker who graduated with a preliminary (not an ed program, no student teaching), got a masters, and now has an initial.  

I don't think you can start with a professional, unless you have the three years experience in another state, but you can certainly go to college in PA and get a teacher license in MA.  Again I'm 90% sure you can get your initial, even without the SEI, but you **have** to take the MTELs.

My MTEL advice is for high school by the way.  There are probably different tests required for middle school.  Maybe someone else can help you.

highschoolteachers,"This happened to my district twice when I was going through school.  One year I was in elementary school and the proposal was to pay for buses.  That was voted down so my elementary school determined only people who lived more than two miles from the school would get a bus.  I was 1.9 miles.  One house on my street could use the bus.  The rest of us had to walk.... on a bridge that went over a highway... to elementary school.  We had three months of carpools before the district was able to provide buses for everyone.

The second time I was in 7th or 8th grade and the sports and arts departments were hit.  We had to pay a crazy high fee to play sports or participate in after school music (band/orchestra/chorus).  Also they closed the middle and high school libraries.  You could only go with a class.  There was no librarian.

Looking back I guess it was better than cutting teachers and having oversized classrooms."
highschoolteachers,"I have such a love/hate relationship with helicopter parents. They're always there if you need them to do something, but they also complain and criticize non-stop. You need to set up some type of boundaries. For example, they can only meet with you before or after school during certain times. It's also okay to tell them they need to schedule such a meeting. Once I was tenured, I started to tell some of these parents what was on my mind (Example: your child is failing my class because they aren't doing any homework. I didn't contact you because they are a senior in high school and need to take responsibility for their grades. You also have 24/7 access to updated grades if you'd like to keep an eye on their progress). I've only had to say this once to my worst helicopter mom. With the other parents, I've let them know that I have their child's best interests at heart. I will contact them if something comes up, otherwise no news is good news. I'm always sure to compliment them on their kid's progress when I see them. I think these parents get worried that they aren't doing enough to make sure their child succeeds. It's hard for them to give up control and trust you, but if a line of communication remains open and you acknowledge the student's success or failures, they'll usually leave you alone.

Edit: be sure to stroke their ego by complimenting them on how much they care about their child's success. They love to hear this and it usually extends the amount of time for the next contact. "
highschoolteachers,"Still a student teacher, but one of my sixth graders got accepted into a high-standard science high school. It's actually one of my frustrations that I wasn't even able to apply there (parent issues). It might be a small thing but I'm still really proud! I knew he had it in him!"
highschoolteachers,"If you've never done it before you should go through a training program and get carded. I started doing rec and a little bit of summer ball when I was 13, but when I got carded for high school I started to get a lot of games.

Unfortunately it's a little late to get certified for HS this season, but you can get a bit of training from another organization for this spring/summer and take the HS class next year.

What state do you live in? If you're in NJ I can help you out."
highschoolteachers,"I'm not a high school teacher but I I taught at the middle school and hated 7th and 8th graders. I'm not sure what happened from 6th grade to 7th but it made my favorite kids become the devil. When I see old students that are in high school, they are back to being grown up versions of their 6th grade self. "
highschoolteachers,I teach mostly high school kids....most of my contacts are the students. I inform them on the first day that the only way they can use their phone is if they sign up for Remind.
highschoolteachers,"I taught 10th and 12th last semester, and am teaching 9th and 10th this semester (First year). Thus far 10th has been pretty great. 12th is good too. But 9th is kind of awful. I expect it would be better if the middle school most of my kids come from was better about discipline but still. There is a lot of learning how to do high school that has to be taught and I don't want to teach that as much as I want to help them think critically about life and my subject area. "
highschoolteachers,"Just wanted to say - as a high school math teacher who RARELY teaches via lecture (I can count on one hand the number of topics I've taught via lecture) you should know there are alternatives. At my school we use the CPM curriculum which is exclusively problem based cooperative learning. The kids work through problems and learn the content through thinking critically about the topics, not by me lecturing to them. Would highly recommend!"
highschoolteachers,"First.  Thank you for assigning homework.  I don't know who is spreading the whole no homework idea, but he or she is an idiot. 

Second I teach high school algebra. The answer is easy.  I assign homework everyday, period.  If they had school they have homework.  "
highschoolteachers,"As a parent of a third grader, I say ""please publish some sort of homework outside of the classroom so that I can instruct my kid to check it.""

As a high school teacher I say, ""WTF, the kid needs to be responsible for this well before 9th grade""."
highschoolteachers,"Look up ""9th grade academy"".  It's meant to provide freshmen a smoother, more guided transition to high school life. "
highschoolteachers,"Just at a crossroads right now. Right now I work as an ed assistant/para for a class of fourth and fifth graders. I'd like to teach middle or high school social studies. I like this job, but it's 30 hrs per week, and not something you can make a career of. 

I was accepted into my masters in education program at UConn in 2016. I put it off a year to find out if teaching was for me, hence finding the ed assistant job, extremely lucky there. I've been there since the start of the school year. I cannot defer the UConn program again. Either this year, or reapply and may not get in. It's full time, $30,000, and a year of my life to complete. 

I have an interview Wednesday for an entry level Web Technician that's full time for a company building their website. It seems more comfortable (but I may not get it anyway), which the teaching program seems like a huge risk. But, i love those kids I work with. And know I'd like teaching...I don't know, I'm torn. "
highschoolteachers,"Not the op but didn't your kids teachers send out something at the beginning of the year explaining the homework policy? It's really not reasonable to ask the teachers to email you specifically whenever homework is assigned.

Also at 10th &amp; 8th grade they really are old enough to be keeping track of their homework - why don't you check their agendas/planners to see if they are writing things down &amp; then doing them. If they don't have or use an agenda, then perhaps you should start enforcing that? Every school in my area hands one out to the students at the beginning of the year. Out of my 80 or so 9th graders, maybe 10 of my students have parents who check their agendas. 

In fact many of the students don't bother to hang onto their planners &amp; by high school it certainly is reasonable to ask them to keep an eye on their things (&amp; they never seem to lose their headphones or phones so I know they can keep track of smaller things if they try). I also give my students other options if they find a paper agenda too hard to use - for example some of my ADD students do better with google calendar since they always have their phone on them &amp; it can send them alerts.

If your kids are having trouble consistently using their agenda, perhaps you can ask their teachers to sign off on it at the end of each class - that way you know they have shown it to their teacher who can tell them if they have written down the correct homework. However they should remember to go up to the teacher &amp; ask for a signature, it's not on the teacher to remind them. If it's not signed then you know they didn't check in with their teachers."
highschoolteachers,"The big problem as a parent is that I often have no idea when there is homework.  The elementary, middle, and high schools my kids have gone to have all changed their homework policies from year to year, with one year having no homework at all, another year having homework only on Fridays, another year having homework only for what is not finished in class, and so forth.  

I cannot keep up as a parent and am incredibly frustrated with trying to figure out if my kid has homework or not.  If they bring things home, I can generally catch it, but I do not always catch it.  And, if they don't bring things home, I don't know if that means they don't have homework or just didn't bring it home.  

I now have two 10th graders and an 8th grader, and I still cannot figure out on a regular basis if they are doing their work until the teacher decides to update their parent portal for me to see the 0's.  And, considering some teachers update daily, some weekly, and some at the end of the six weeks, it can again be hard to find out.  

I will say, having had three kids go through 5th grade, that if you are relying on the students to get everything done and not communicating with the parents about what needs to be done, then things are going to fall through the cracks.  As a parent (and an educator myself), I need to know what is going on, so the other suggestions here of a weekly email or class website that updates me on what is going on is extraordinarily helpful.  

And, as someone who teaches college students now, I smile at the idea that a 5th grader needs to be held responsible and accountable for their work when I cannot even get college students to complete the work they are supposed to do.

So, I am not trying to attack you, as you have not given much information here as to what the situation is, but if you are shutting out the parents from the conversation, then the parents are sitting at home fuming about how the teacher never communicates with them.  In elementary school (and middle school), the parents should still be an active part of their child's education, and, if you are turning down requests from parents to know what is going on with their child's education, then that is not good.  "
highschoolteachers,10th and 11th grades are the best at high school level. 9th and 12th grade are too immature or short sighted.
highschoolteachers,"I was the best man at a wedding, and the groom had rented out this great place for the reception after the wedding. I was stressed out about the best man speech, and all of the other things associated with helping ensure that this logistical display of 100 people and all of the moving pieces to ti went well.

After the best man speech I got pretty drunk. After that I'm out on the dance floor dancing with my girlfriend, and hanging out with friends, and continued drinking. 

I teach a high school elective, and one of my juniors was waitressing for the catering company. She had done a modest mouse song at the school talent show a few weeks beforehand.

In my somewhat inebriated state, I made her get up on stage with the wedding band and sing a modest mouse song. The band played Float On, but that wasn't the one she had done for the talent show. It was still pretty decent overall, but the poor girl was mortified.

That's definitely my worst one. My only defense is it seemed like a good idea at the time. "
highschoolteachers,"None of mine are all that embarrassing. I work at a surf shop over the summers so a handful of students end up coming in, or I see them at the Walmart that is in our area (the school I work at is only 2 towns away) and I always just joke with them saying ""Ugh, and I'm in shorts and a tank so you can see like ALL of my tattoos! Don't tell anyone!"" 

The couple of 'questionable' run ins that I had were, obviously, unexpected. Like while at a wedding, I found out one of my students (well a student who goes to the school I work at) is actually my SOs cousin. Another time at a friends bday party while I was pretty deep in my cups, I looked up to see that one of my students was there and he had said that the friend who I was there for was actually his sister (but they have different last names). But the top of the cake was one New Years Eve as I was leaving the liquor store and I thought I recognized the kid who was at the counter paying while I was leaving..I brushed it off though but when I got to my car, I noticed the car parked next to me was FULL of high schoolers who all turned and looked at me like they were all just caught by their mom. I glared at them and said ""Wait til you come back to school......"" just to give them some paranoia....I actually didn't know their names though. "
highschoolteachers,"Here's my order: 

1.  Juniors
2.  Sophomores 
3.  Seniors
4.  Freshmen 

Juniors are the sweet spot for high school.  They've gotten the hang of high school at this point and have figured out what they need to do to get stuff done, and are pretty focused in this grade.  This is the year they take SAT's, ACT's, etc and are really planning for their future.  By their senior year, they can be really apathetic and can be mentally checked out, since they're already preparing themselves for the next phase. 

Sophomores have more maturity than freshmen.  I swear that something happens over the summer before 9th grade that makes freshmen boys regress in their maturity level.  The girls are pretty okay for the most part.  

EDIT:  I teach an equal share of 9th - 12th graders, since I teach Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2.  I have about 50 students from each grade this year.  

"
highschoolteachers,"It's said that elementary teachers are more interested in teaching the kid and high school teachers are more interested in teaching the subject. This is obviously a gross exaggeration, but as a secondary science teacher, there is some truth to the statement. I would be bewildered and frustrated teaching English. Don't get me wrong: I adore literature and creative writing, but even after requiring my students to submit small abstracts in my class, I can't fathom having to fix their syntax. In fact I don't care much for even life sciences like aquatics, biology, and pathophysiology. I prefer to teach chemistry, physics, and astronomy which generally target 10th-12th grade. My favorite grades are 10th-11th because they're not as defiant or apathetic as seniors. These are the years I get to really stretch their mental faculties. Most kids can't pass chemistry and physics with minimal effort; to truly succeed in my courses REQUIRES critical thinking skills. Seniors provide for some interesting discussions and questions, though. I also enjoy being the capstone to their entire science education in public school."
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school, but it really depends on your personality and what you feel most comfortable with. I teach 7th and definitely wouldn't teach high school (they are too tired, jaded, and uninterested from my experience in student teaching). You get some silliness and some immaturity in 7th, but you also get a high energy and high curiosity group of kids to work with.  You also get to teach a group of kids trying to figure out how to become teenagers (which is always fun!) I know most teachers would rather die than teach middle school, but I love it!  "
highschoolteachers,"Juniors and seniors have better impulse control. Freshmen boys are just big middle schoolers, however freshmen girls are pretty mature. That said, I would probably take freshmen over seniors, who are pretty apathetic at my school. I love juniors though, never taught sophomores. Juniors are old enough to have real world conversations with, but they still care about high school."
highschoolteachers,"I can't speak for secondary teachers in general, but for me: yes, I strongly prefer to teach 11th and 12th graders due to their increased maturity and decreased behavior issues. 

In high school (at least in my district), grade level promotion is tied to course credits. If a student doesn't have enough credits to qualify for the next grade level, s/he doesn't move up. This means that students with severe behavioral issues tend to repeat 9th and/or 10th grade at least once, resulting in an increased concentration of challenging behavior in those courses. I've taught all four grade levels at an urban Title I school and the 9th grade classes were a nightmare; my stress level has decreased considerably now that I only teach 11th grade."
highschoolteachers,"Not me personally, but one of our 4th grade teachers has an insulin pump. Sometimes, like when it's moved to her arm, it's visible. She just explains to the class what it is, and gives a basic overview of what diabetes is. She also teaches them about what it might look like if she's in trouble - without being scary about it - and teaches them to send someone to the office or another classroom if it happens. The kids have always been great about it. I would hope that if 4th graders can wrap their heads around it, high school students would, too. Keep it simple, but factual, and then move on. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Second year teacher here. I have three preps at a Title 1 high school, and the school is so disorganized that I'm creating curriculum for two of my classes as I teach them. I get to work at 7:30, and sometimes leave as late as 6 or 7. I also usually spend at least a few hours on Sunday grading and planning. 

It really sucks, but it's mostly because I'm writing curriculum. I anticipate next year being much easier."
highschoolteachers,"Immensely. Customer service and management helped me get strong with trouble shooting, creating work systems and being organized, delegating responsibilities (i have 3-4 teachers aides per day to supervise) and keeping on my ""game face"", patience,  whatever you would like to call it. It also helps you understand what work skills students need as they graduate high school! "
highschoolteachers,"As a future high school math teacher, I like to try and stay up to date on the changes in US schooling. I found this articles and find most points, if not all, to be absurd. It appears the author found 10 random worksheets that had some misprints and formulated an opinion about common core based on these worksheets. 

What are all your thoughts about this? Do these worksheets give the true example of common core?"
highschoolteachers,"I want to be a high school biology teacher maybe an ecology, micro, or forensics teacher. I plan to go into a masters program (I know this is what I want to do). I just want to know if there is anything I can do now to get ready. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a teacher in high school who did a directions quiz but on a multiple choice test. I lost the little respect I had for him, he was a crappy teacher. I was a student who listened and was always on task, blah blah but didn't read the directions for a multiple choice test that looked the same as every other test I had taken all my life, minus those stupid directions. Still bitter. "
highschoolteachers,"As with salary, it's amazing how much workload can vary across districts and even school sites.

In my area the high schools are very well supported by bonds and other local funding, so they have reduced class sizes and fewer classes.  A large number of students also attend private high schools, leaving fewer students to serve.

The elementary school district has repeatedly been denied by the voters, and the board has prioritized elementary school spending over middle school.  Consequently the middle schools in our district are severely overcrowded, making it harder and harder to find and keep single-subject teachers."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, and I write instructions out.

Which doesn't help you.

Hot tea works wonders. Also, clap or flash the lights to get attention. Tell your students ""Ms. Muppetmaniac has lost her voice. I need you to pay extra attention, because I can't be loud."" Get a whistle for the playground. Instead of cold calling students names, tap them on the shoulder. 

Get plenty of sleep, and make hot toddies at home. Honey whiskey in hot tea with a little apple juice is really effective to me."
highschoolteachers,"Wow, reduced work load for high school? I'm a high school teacher and I'm actually going to talk to my administration about the insane work load I have. I'm teaching 3,subjects I've never taught. My middle school friends are sitting pretty with earlier release times and half the grading."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, OP is going to have to do their own research, as this is going to vary heavily on where you are located.  In my area (densely populated Northern California) high schools are pretty much never part of the elementary school district.  They have their own districts and their own income streams, so high school teachers are almost always paid 10-20% more than middle and elementary teachers.  We have a big problem with middle school teachers jumping ship to the high school for the bigger paychecks and reduced workload.

In my area you google '(District Name) Salary Schedule' to see the breakdown of how much you get paid per education level and years of experience."
highschoolteachers,"APA is what is preferred in scientific papers in the professional world, and MLA seems to be (less solidly) more popular for literary papers and the like and is required by many states for the students to know. But I really don't know about chicago.

highschoolteachers,"Most teachers (once you get to high school) ditch printing for a half cursive half print mess. I'm pretty sure cursive was taken out of the curriculum (or it seems so) when I was in 6th grade (would've been about 5 years ago)...

It's the odd transition period."
highschoolteachers,I would love a copy of the one you use for high school.
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for your kind suggestions. I was just trying to point out that for middle and high school English, there are better uses for money than iPads. 

I'm going to be using our school computers to edit our films for Drama and I already have multiple units for students to research things like Shakespeare's monologues or creating a ""newspaper"" on what it was like to be a migrant farm worker during the depression. None of these things replace textbooks and novels though, in my humble opinion. Rather, they build upon them."
highschoolteachers,My students are in high school. Are yours third grade elementary? 
highschoolteachers,"+4 on Clark's. I'm female, but I wear men's shoes primarily because they last longer. I've had one pair of them literally since high school. They're too worn out for school, but damn are they still comfortable."
highschoolteachers,"We do at my elementary school, and I think it's pretty common these days for grade levels to work as ""teams"" and give common assessment. 

My husband on the other hand teaches high school and he has some wiggle room with grading. They don't all take the same grades all the time. I believe they do give some form of common assessment though, at the very least. 

Edit: Our spec. ed kids take the same tests as our other kids unless their IEP states otherwise. "
highschoolteachers,"Lying to him is going to be so helpful. I'm not even certain it's mathematically possible for him to pass the class at this point. I've been incredibly helpful, answering his questions and directing him to resources via email at all hours of the day and night. At some point, he has to learn that he needs to come to class and take notes, and that if he still isn't successful, that he needs to figure out what is missing in his foundation and go back and learn it. This isn't elementary school. I wouldn't even lie to my high school students like that. It's not acceptable. "
highschoolteachers,"If I were an elementary or middle school teacher, perhaps I would feel differently. However, even after reading that article, I still would not allow it in my high school science and calculus classes."
highschoolteachers,"...says the Latin teacher.


(I kid, I kid.  Latin is extremely useful in understanding language and I am a big fan of it and took it in high school.  But I still couldn't resist.)"
highschoolteachers,"Going? Gone. The few remaining individuals who continue to use it are just remnants, not any sort of sustaining force. As a high school teacher with about 160 students, **two** use cursive. This is the first time in years that I have any at all."
highschoolteachers,"Most of my high school students can barely write cursive and have trouble reading it. I don't have a problem with that, as my cursive handwriting is about as sophisticated as it was when I was in 4th grade and stopped using it.

Most of my students from Haiti, on the other hand, have beautiful script, so cursive lives on in some places."
highschoolteachers,"Your example is a huge question about performance-based ratings.  Another one that I in particular have is - how would I get rated?  There's no state test for my subject in high school.  There is the MCAS in Massachusetts.  Students take it in Biology (what about Chem and Physics teachers?!), Geometry (what about the Algebra/Calculus teachers?) and English after 10th grade (what about the 11th and 12th grade teachers?).  There is no state test in Social Studies.  How do I get evaluated? "
highschoolteachers,"For me, working in a high-needs high school, teaching was the most punishing and most rewarding job I've ever had. The turn over rate is high. People leave for the very reasons that you mention. It will probably be hard, and the first two years are the hardest.

The only constructive advice I can give is to try subbing if you get through student teaching and aren't sure about signing a contract. That would give you the flexibility to quit, and also let you spend some time working on the performative aspect of teaching before tackling the planning and grading.
"
highschoolteachers,"The program I'm in specifically focuses on high needs schools. In my area there are only 2 that meet the criteria (that are within a 30 minute drive one way). The other school.....is not a place I want to go. There have been lots of documented cases of violence against teachers there. The high school I went to is actually 10 minutes from my apartment, if they would let me go there I think I would be less anxious about things. As far as wanting to teach I love history and the best way I know how to help people while using that is education so that's more or less why I want to teach."
highschoolteachers,"direct every step of their learning experience, the trick here is to keep them busy without you having to talk all of the time. You will see that they do want to learn but you have to have something to get their attention.  I teach elementary level and trust me if I had the high school power I would just kick them out  but you have to do the opposite keep them in and make them want to learn.  

Seating is one thing but in order to do that you must identify where and when to move them.  I do that when class is in progress and lately I have been moving them and when they don't want to follow through make a call right there and then to their parents.  

don't ever ask them anything with a please, you have to direct and don't make eye contact with them just point and keep your eyes on the thing they must do.  hopefully this helps I'm in the process still and it is going to be hard but once you get it going you will have your good times.

"
highschoolteachers,I have students as old as 20 in my high school and I'm 22. Like everyone else has said it's all about how you carry yourself and making sure you're the authority in class.  Unless you're in a very academically focused school (usually one that is selective and application based) you will have students who try to take over your classroom. Have a great classroom management plan and stick to it is the biggest advice I can give. They said they think I'm late 20's early 30's. Not sure how I feel about that. : (
highschoolteachers,If you're teaching high school you can pop in to the room next door to ask the teacher to listen for disruptions while you run to the rest room. My neighbor had a parapro most of the day who would cover our classrooms at the end of the hall. 
highschoolteachers,"Don't say anything unless he says something to you first. Then cite his abscesses and lack of attention in class as you would any other student.  He's a big scary dude, but you have to try and ignore that and treat him the same as everyone else.  I teach high school kids who are HUGE and have that whole I'm crazy and could f you up look in their eyes, but I call their bluff. ... This approach has worked well for every kid who has tried this crap with me- including a couple of 20year old remedial kids (when I taught reading remediation) who were pissed because the failed both my class and or the AHSGE and weren't going to graduate.  "
highschoolteachers,"While in HS, I had maybe two teachers that I could tolerate.  In turn, I did VERY WELL in their classes.  The rest of my classes were frequently missed (very good Galaga player here).  

Thanks to two high school teachers, I made it back to college (after a long time out).  I graduated junior college with a 3.86 GPA.  I still have a overall GPA of 3.2+ at Arizona State.  I hppe that I can offer that second chance to other children before they really need it."
highschoolteachers,"I suggest checking out the ""Extra Credits"" Youtube channel.  They adress both gamification in education as well as other fields.  I do not believe it has activities dedicated to the last three years of high school but instead general ideas on how to integrate it into the classroom.  They have a specific playlist on gamification if you can find it.  Hope this helps."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school Spanish teacher in exactly the same boat as you. I live with my girlfriend and also live in a neighborhood with scarce street parking. Plus, I live 45 minutes from my school. I'm also the soccer coach so my day is usually 12-14 hours from the time I wake up until the time I get home. When the season is over you can bet your ass I am out of there as soon as my contractual time is reached. 

The IB coordinator at my school often says something that I really held onto. She says ""good teaching is good teaching"". Any teacher that needs validation by openly talking about how many hours they put in and all that they do can shove it. I got into education to teach. I don't get involved in water cooler talk or the school politics. My job is to go in there and teach those kids to the best of my ability and I do just that. I put in a shit ton of hours, but I don't go around gloating about it. Some teachers need to get off their high horse"
highschoolteachers,"It would be against the contract in my district to assign such a placement without permission from you (no more than 2 preps can be assigned, though some people are happy to work multiple preps and do - like our band teacher who teaches many kinds of band). Sometimes 1st year teachers are pressured to sign these waivers to get jobs too. I see that happen. 

I don't really understand the multi-prep thing that much. The math teachers at my school could all (or all but one, if the numbers don't perfectly align) have a SINGLE prep, but instead, they each have 2 and one newbie has 3 because they wanted more people teaching each subject. I don't get it. Let someone do one thing well. I think it's to pad our PLCs. I'm ELA, so I have only one prep this year, thank goodness (though I've had 2 or 3 before). I get at small schools, it might be necessary, but it seems to be happening with unnecessary frequency. 

As to class size, my contract limits core class sizes to 21 in my school (no limits for electives, really but my school sets them), 25 in high schools (I teach MS). When I complained about my school overbooking classes (which they fixed) here, people basically said, ""Suck it up."" Personally, I refuse to teach anywhere that they pile in kids, though 30 in HS might not be bad. I remember 25 in 11th being easier than 21 in 8th, personally. Nationwide, average-wise, 30 seems about normal for a HS. "
highschoolteachers,"I have it pretty good. I teach 2 preps (3 last year) and have 85 (90) students. My friend teaches 3 preps, 175 students at a middle school, I have another friend at a public high school who teaches 2 preps and 145 students. I've heard of this being a problem elsewhere too. I'd say it's a general issue with public schools in general. I know I feel super overwhelmed grading 56 Algebra 1 tests and it can take me upwards of 3 or 4 hours to do so. I can't even imagine if that number were tripled. I wouldn't have any time to teach!

Edit: Grammar."
highschoolteachers,"The great thing about high school is that you don't need to use children-related activities like video games to gain student interest and develop interactive learning.

Those kids are figuring out what they want to do with their life, and are preparing for colleges and careers. Their curiosity opens the door to much more fields and areas, and high school teachers should be guiding their exploration.

Instead of using video games to aid learning, high schools are (or should be) bringing colleges and careers to the students. And high school students greatly value this preparation."
highschoolteachers,"It's normal for a smaller/medium school. I teach history + elective history at a small public high school. My classes are each only a semester, so throughout the year I teach 8 different classes. This semester I have 4 different preps in 6 hour and next semester I'll have 6 different preps in 6 hours with only 2 repeating from first semester! It's definitely overwhelming!"
highschoolteachers,"My music theory teacher/band director in high school introduced the class in the first week by pointing out stuff like this. He made it clear that we're going to study music that has religious ties, but he was in no way asking us to believe any of it. Bach didn't have much of a choice, and he's one of the greatest composers in human history. Everyone with all the power and money was also tied to religion, hence historically significant religious music.

With regards to OP, I'd be interested in what they actually consider ""appropriate"". Would Poe? Would Lord of the Flies? Ender's Game? Do they not understand the concept of Fiction vs. Nonfiction?"
highschoolteachers,"This is my first year teaching. As a high school student, I never cheated, so I have been stunned at how much cheating goes on in my classroom. And i teach choir! 

We had been singing Thriller for a week and I gave an easy fill-in-the-blanks lyrics quiz and I had two students who cheated on that. The last quiz I gave had so much cheating, I didn't even enter their scores into the computer, I just threw them all away.

What I'm going to start doing is call them up to me one at a time and ask them two review questions (the questions will be different for every student) and grade them on their answers because otherwise I won't know if they have mastered the material or not.
"
highschoolteachers,"And yet amazingly enough there have been millions of teenagers who managed to graduate high school with A's and B's and go on to success in college and beyond, despite having to wake up early.  I averaged around 6 hours of sleep a night throughout high school and somehow I did just fine.  "
highschoolteachers,"In my state, if you want to teach at the high school level, you would major in Biology and minor in education. If you want to teach at the college level you will need at the least a minor in Biology. 

If you were in my state and you can swing it, I'd recommend you get a double major in Bio and Chem, and see if you can pass the composite science test. "
highschoolteachers,"I've known multiple people who've done this. A good way to do it is to look for paraprofessional jobs at local high schools--the title might be ""tutor,"" ""aide"" or ""classroom assistant."" You could be helping support kids with disabilities or in a resource room setting. It's good because they expect less experience for these types of positions. See if you like the school environment, build relationships in the building, get in good with the district--then you can decide if you want to begin pursuing your masters for a teaching position. "
highschoolteachers,"Hey man I'm actually a first year male elementary school teacher. I graduated in May and landed my job in late July. It's an awesome school, which make things easier.

My best advice: you'll be living in a woman's world. Take advantage of that. Try to hone in on your handy man skills. You'll be asked to move things, fixed things, etc. do those things with pleasure and always have a smile on your face.

Realize that your colleagues know your a male and understand that you may not be big on the cutesie classroom and you will have a different way of doing things. 

Do your best to maintain your friendships through college or keep your high school friends if you still live in the same area. Chances are, there won't be many fantasy football parties after school in the teachers lounge.

Keep your work life and personal life separate.  You may become great friends with your colleagues, but that gender gap will always be there.


Oh yea, on top of all that, learn how to teach, too :)

I'm actually looking for someone to help me start a blog for male teachers. PM me if your interested or have any questions about the above.

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I'm not sure what subject you teach,but I teach high school math. My biggest thing is not to grade everything. I put a stamp or star on lots of things because I just glance at,mostly practice stuff or things we just learned. When I do grade an assignment,usually I pick a few random ones to check for mastery and then completion for full points. Assessments are short because numbers don't prove mastery,as long as they mastered it,who cares if they do ten or thirty?

Also,scheduling is so important. Today is Tuesday,so I'm going to be creating next week lesson plan and filling out any paperwork I have. Tomorrow is Wednesday so I'm going to be editing and finalizing any work for next week. Once you have a schedule established it won't be perfect,but it lets you calm down because you know you will have the time to do your work. 

Also I have one day a week that I plan on staying late if I have work to catch up on. It's the same day for detentions if I have any and to call home if I have to. That way it's not everyday,I just tell myself wait until Thursday. And if I'm good then I decide to work ahead or go home (i usually go home).There is always something to be done,but at three I'm gone to my kids and unless it's a  emergency I won't stay late. 

Teaching is the only profession where you get guilt tripped for not wanting to work for free, focus your time and try to be a few days ahead so most days you get to go home early :) good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"man, I wish I could eat lunch with my coworkers. I travel between an elementary and the high school, and my HS classes are right in the middle of the day. I get to feel anonymous at *two* schools!"
highschoolteachers,"I have covered my room with quotes from my favorite books. These can be inspirational, informative, and even hit fundamental info. Some my favorites for middle and high school students:
1. Everyone has learning difficulties, because learning to speak French or understanding relativity is difficult (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime).
2. Perhaps it is impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be (Ender's Game).
3. There is a way to be good again (Kite Runner).

I also mix in some funny quotes and create posters with any helpful/amusing phrases I come across. (Ex: I like cooking my family and pets. Use commas. Don't be a psycho)

You can create and print your own color 11 x 14 posters (on thin paper) at Staples for about $1 a piece."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school mathematics. And no. It's not too early. The number one indication of whether or not a specific student will drop out of high school is whether or not they pass Algebra 1. 

I've been frustrated that elementary schools teach students ""tricks"" and ""rules"" for ""the basics"" that do not translate in to higher mathematics. Students get frustrated that what they've been taught is wrong, and they have to relearn everything they thought they knew. So why not start off right from the beginning? 

An example. When you divide, you always divide the small number into the big number.

Until you learn about fractions. 

When you subtract, the small number is taken away from the big number.

Until you learn about negative numbers. 

The equal sign means this is the answer. 

Until you learn about equations.

Trust me, they are doing your niece a big favor. She isn't dumb. But I would rather not have to unteach ""the basics"" when she gets to high school, and it will be easier for her if she doesn't have to unlearn ""the basics."" Think of mathematics as a whole instead of chunking it into grade levels. She has to learn algebra eventually. Why not start with something simple, like a basic equation now. That way she won't have to unlearn everything her elementary teachers taught her in middle and high school. 

If she can do 3+2= and get 5, why shouldn't she be able to do 3+2=x therefore x=5. And then work towards 3+x=5. Basic algebraic theory is something you should be able to understand as soon as you can add and subtract. 

I'd love to see this worksheet. "
highschoolteachers,"I had one like this last year. At first, I would nag and chase and harass her, but none of that worked. Being concerned, being nice kind of worked. I found out all sorts of similar info to your student. Tons of outside adults involved to try and help. None seemed to make a difference. What really hit home for her though was one day, she walked in late, and I turned and was genuinely happy to see her. I let her know it didn't matter that she was late and placed her into a group that was ahead on their assignment and could easily catch her up to speed. She knew I was giving her an easy out that day and appreciated it. She started coming in more often. Sometimes late. Sometimes only for my class, but her attendance did gradually improve. I excused her from stuff when she wasn't there to participate and gave alternate assignments to her specifically on stuff I knew she was good at (like writing essays and book reports about books she liked to read, about characters like herself with out of control lives).
At the end of the year, she mentioned something about my class being the one place she ever felt wanted and talented. I hope she finds another teacher at her high school to keep encouraging her this year."
highschoolteachers,"I use it inconsistently in high school as a tool for me - not my students. I teach English, and I will use it primarily for discussions to see who is talking and who is not participating. I also use it to keep track of my struggle bunnies because it's faster than writing out a log for every non- major misdemeanor. When an admin wants to have a discussion about one of my bunnies, I can show the consistent inattentiveness of the student. I also really like the random student selection feature because I am no longer liable for who is called on to answer a question. It keeps the students from saying I'm picking on them. Overall, I like it, but it's not something I use all day everyday. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a 1st year teacher at a relatively good high school and I hate my life.  I went around to tour gyms my first week but I haven't joined one because I have realized I have no time.  We have 90 min classes every other day and I often have to stay after school 3 hours to plan.

Also, my school eliminated the resource room classes for students in special ed, so guess where they put a lot of them?  In Spanish 1!  Of course, they have trouble reading in English so lets put them in a foreign language class.  Thankfully I have a helper in that class and lots of support.

Then on top of everything, even though I started at Masters +30 with 5 years, after taxes/pension/insurance I am bringing home much less than I expected (this is due to my ignorance mostly).

If I don't start actually enjoying my life a bit I might burn out.  That or try to teach abroad somewhere where life would be a bit more interesting for me.

I know a lot of teachers have it rougher, but this is how I feel.  And there's the fact I'm in a city where I don't know anyone which doesn't help.

Rant/therapy hour over.  I know, world's smallest violin.  I probably focus too much on my failures and not enough on my successes."
highschoolteachers,"There's nothing you can do that isn't punitive. In all seriousness, college isn't high school. I don't even check textbooks out to my students. We don't used them. We may have cracked the textbook twice last year. Students have got to know that in college, which is different from high school, you have to read the text. And the only way they can learn that is to fail at something. 

Every student goes to college thinking that they've done school for 12-15 years, and they've got this. Every student figures out at some point that college is ***different***. You cannot convince an 18 year old that they do not know everything - believe me, I've tried. They've got to learn that for themselves. 

Here's what I would do. I would not tell them it's a good idea to read the text before class, I would require it. I would not start class with a lecture. I would start class by cold calling some students and asking them questions about the reading. That will make it abundantly clear that they should have read something before coming to class. And embarrass the shit out of them when they haven't read it. After the third or fourth kid says ""I dunno, were we supposed to read something?"" you say loudly, assertively ""You will fail this class unless you do the assigned readings."" Point at the kids you called on. ""YOU will fail this class if you don't do the readings,"" point at another kid ""YOU will fail this class if you don't do the assigned readings."" and another, ""YOU will fail this class if you don't do the assigned readings."" Then inform them that you will not be reminding them what the readings are. They're in the syllabus. Inform them there will be a quiz over the readings next time. And ***then*** you can lecture. 

Got a million students in your class, and don't want to grade a quiz? Find a site like [zondle](https://www.zondle.com/publicPagesv2/) to grade them for you. I teach high school so all my quiz sites have to look like fun. Yours don't."
highschoolteachers,"That was going to be my choice too. In high school I found a collection of Ray Bradbury short stories and DEVOURED them. Some are just straight sci-fi, but a lot of them are beautifully creepy. I was trying to find the name of my favorite but I can't find it for the life of me (if anyone else might know, it's the one about the woman walking home alone at night while a serial killer's loose)."
highschoolteachers,"You've got an interesting question here.  I think you'll find that most American high schools are cutting back on what are seen as ""elective"" classes these days, and for the most part, don't have psychology classes on offer.  What that means for you is that it's unlikely that you'll be hired by a district primarily to teach psych.  Instead, it may be a course that you can offer beyond a major subject like social studies or English Language Arts.  In my NYC high school, for the first time this year, we have a full time psych teacher, but her course will fulfill English requirements for seniors and some juniors.  

I would recommend that you get your bachelor's degree in psych (and double major in education if possible), get a masters in teaching, and then work towards certification in a major subject.  (English, ESL, or Special Education would almost certainly be better bets for job hunting than social studies.)  "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; there is ~~usually~~ **often** a strong correlation

I don't think you can go so far as to say ""usually"" here. Yes, it's a warning sign, but these are high school kids. EVERYTHING is sexual for them, and it doesn't all stem from abuse.

EDIT: Sorry, I'm quibbling with your choice of word. I'm a professional editor as well as a teacher, and precise word choice is my stock in trade. The next two comments are more what I'm getting at. ""May have been"" and ""I'd be worried about the possibility.""  ""Usually"" is a pretty broad brush."
highschoolteachers,"HAHA! I love that movie!! Once my daughter got Saturday detention in high school and I almost fell over laughing--I didn't know they really did that! But, yeah, even Judd Nelson has to wake up or GTFO. "
highschoolteachers,"Picture this: 9th grade Earth Science class. Catholic high school.

I have given the students modeling clay to use for a lab. One boy was pounding on his pile of modeling clay while I was talking. So, I yelled across the class, ""STOP WHACKING IT!"" Hilarity ensued. "
highschoolteachers,"I think the point you made about teaching high school students who were raised on a formulaic approach with the new core standards based curriculum is really important.  The education field is in a huge time of transition and change (IMO) and our students in high school math courses are caught in the middle, and thus, a whole lot more likely to actively resist the change in type of instruction because their math learning expectations, habits, and attitudes are quite set already.

I have seen this played out in my classroom over the last couple of school years in Algebra I and Geometry as I began teaching using CC curriculum.  It is definitely a change that, to be implemented properly and sustainably, requires a lot of extra thought, time, effort, and coaching of students and parents on the part of the teacher.  Then again, that's the key with most ""fads"" in education, I think. We need, as teachers, the time and freedom to develop those kinds of plans and resources in advance of large scale implementation of a particular ""program"", but somehow that critical piece is often left out of the process.

I'll step down off my soap box now!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school now.  The students will *not* study for a test if they're not 1,000% sure of what the format of the test will be or what will be on it.  

God help them if you say the words ""word bank"".  All they want is word banks.  No writing, no independent thought, just a paragraph with some words removed.  Because that's a valuable skill, somehow.   "

highschoolteachers,"&gt; what parents really don't like about the core is that their kids aren't learning math the way that they learned it and that they can't help their kids with homework or help them study for a test. I get angry emails and notes weekly about how their child didn't complete the homework because the parent couldn't help them with this new Common Core math.

I haven't been in a classroom yet, but I am seeing the effects of the Core in some of my Math Education classes. We are discussing how some of the techniques that are being used now differ from how we learned them, and we've only been out of high school three or four years.

&gt; As good as math education is with the Core, we've really done a shit job educating parents about what the Core is and what it isn't.

And people like [this](http://video.foxnews.com/v/3768060274001/gutfeld-common-core-is-like-a-hangover/#sp=show-clips) are not helping. Note: I don't think of Fox News as a reputable source of information, but it has a large following."
highschoolteachers,"I figured elementary would need more help with their work and probably be more tiring but wouldn't have as many disciplinary problems as middle or high school. I've already got a few time filler game instructions printed to carry with me, things like 4 corners and heads up 7up. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm in an alternative program where all but one of my students are pregnant. I do a lot of emphasis on vocational training at the local community college. I try to encourage my kids to get a certificate that will allow them to get a job making skilled wages, around here that means double minimum wage. A lot of my kids get certificates to operate forklifts. We're not far from a walmart distribution center. 

I will help them apply and fill out financial aid forms. And as soon as they finish high school, I get them to register for classes. 

A lot of them come to me pregnant, or with pregnant girlfriends, and no idea how to get past the birth. They need a plan for after."
highschoolteachers,"Fight like hell to keep him out of that class. I seriously doubt that your son is fit for that class, but if he goes there it's going to be bad. It's more likely that your son is having problems at school in general (as you say, there's been some bullying). You may have to find another place for your son. I've known teachers who have home schooled. It sounds like hell to me, but they've done it on very modest incomes. You might also think about both of you moving a to private high school when the time comes. They're usually affordable if you're on staff there. Oh and spend some time with your son. See if you can find out what's going on with him. If it helps you locate the problem, then maybe you could as the administration to test him in other circumstances."
highschoolteachers,"/u/TablesAreUsuallyFlat gives a lot of good info. One thing I want to add is that private schools are a different story from public schools. The certification that's required for public schools isn't a requirement for private ones. It often helps, of course, but the state-to-state thing is less of an issue. I teach at a private school and hold a credential for a different state (the state where I went to college).

I'll be honest - it's a difficult job market for beginning teachers in general. Even if you were a US citizen, with your limited experience you would probably need to apply to lots of schools before finding a job. I don't mean that to discourage you; rather, I want to encourage you to keep up the hunt even if it doesn't come quickly.

Sorry I don't have any first-hand info to pass on. The closest thing is that I had an Australian physics teacher in high school (at a private school). However, he a) had a PhD, which I'm sure helped his candidacy and b) may have already been married to his American wife when he started at the school."
highschoolteachers,"I LOVE KAHOOT!! I've started using it daily as a review in my high school nutrition class. The winner gets a sticker on their interactive notebook, and whoever has the most stickers at the end of the semester gets lunch made by me of their choice! They get really into it, and it has really enhanced my classroom. "
highschoolteachers,"I wake up at 5:35 and go to sleep usually around 11-12. I always want to go to bed earlier, but it just doesn't happen. I leave the house at 6:35 and get to school right at 7, our contracted time. School starts at 8, and we have the hour before school starts for ""planning"" because we have the shortest school day legally allowed, from 8:00 to 2:00 (high school) and so teach straight through without breaks (other than lunch)."
highschoolteachers,"For high school history (or ELA): [Facing History](http://www.facinghistory.org).  Friggin love this organization.

Also a big fan of [SHEG](http://www.sheg.stanford.edu)"
highschoolteachers,"You can interview me if you want. I teach high school art. I have IEPs, emotionally challenged, high poverty, and also an autism and Multiple Disability Students ... we can skype. If you're interested let me know"
highschoolteachers,"Find some curriculum online. There's no need to rebuild the wheel. I've heard that EngageNY is good for math, and ELA (Except for high school, and I'm required to use ENY which seems half-finished at this point). There are also tons of other resources, like readwritethink (probably better for charts/graphs and such).

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math. I have around 15 students with (mostly) mild to moderate learning and emotional disabilities out of my 130. If that interests you, send me a PM and we can arrange a call."
highschoolteachers,"I appreciate it. I'll keep your advice close to heart! These guys want to be here; none of them are being forced to. I'm going to do everything I can to get them up to speed! 


I've got access to SuperTeacher and a wide variety of resources; a lot of what a community college offers.  I taught high school and worked as a sub, in addition to various education-related activities. My issue has always been designing curriculum; I freeze up , though I'm fine in the classroom.

-I'll definitely look for more mature texts. It's obvious, but I didn't even think of that. Thanks. "
highschoolteachers,"My thoughts on how to execute your plans:  your subject material is mostly high school level.  You'll need to find a way to make it relevant to them.

As an example - I teach ESL to 5th graders.  Most of my students read English at a K or 1st grade level.  However, they get offended if I bring in an obvious 1st grade level text *""this is for little kids!!""*.  I try to find relevant and level-appropriate texts that won't seem demeaning.  Even something as simple as finding a story with a 'not-little-kid' cover on it helps.

What is your teaching background?  What resources do you have to call upon?
"
highschoolteachers,"I'm assuming you teach world language since you mentioned mindsnack. I teach an Asian language in high school and I use Quizlet for students to review at home. I don't integrate it into the class activities since it can be boring and rote, but for some students they respond well to that kind of program of practice.

Sometimes I will give them challenge words that they can only find on my Quizlet sets, so it forces them to look at it. A lot of kids like this as a study tool and it's become a part of our classroom culture, where students bug me if I forget to upload a set for their next vocab.

Parents love it too since it gives them insight on how students are doing."
highschoolteachers,"I hate to rain on your parade but pause, take a deep breath and think before accepting this money. Check with the principal, your district and the union, cover all your legal and professional bases and then really examine whether or not this parent has an expectation or not attached to this money. If you're in high school, grades are important and I wouldn't be surprised if the this parent expects unique and special treatment for their kid.

I had a parent offer to buy brand new class textbooks for all my periods, an amount that would have over $10,000. She kept insisting but I declined since her kid was kind of dense and I knew she expected me to give him an A. 

Even if you can accept this money it most likely has to go through the school and district, probably through a parent foundation if you have one. You shouldn't touch or talk money with kids' parents ever. Besides the school might even have rules on what you can and cannot buy and what logistics to go through with the purchasing department.

Be careful! Hopefully it's innocuous."
highschoolteachers,"You could always try what my high school calculus teacher did. He had a bulletin board. He told is he would put important things on there, like dates of tests and quizzes, extra credit assignments, etc. He told us it was our responsibility to read it every day.

One morning, he gave us a quiz. It had been scheduled on the bulletin board, but still some of us were surprised, but not as surprised as when, at the end, he said, ""Exchange papers, we'll grade each other's work."" We did that, and then... he walked over to the bulletin board and pulled down the answer key, where it had been posted all week.

Trust me, we never forgot to read that board again."
highschoolteachers,"I noticed that Scholastic doesn't carry high school literature, or at least I've noticed that from browsing around for a few minutes. It seems to be mostly elementary and middle school stuff. Am I looking in the wrong place?"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school and I see this as well. In school students go on ""autopilot"" and don't actually engage with the material or make mental connections. Sometimes it feels more like I am trying to program and robot to do tasks with specific instructions rather than teaching to young people. "
highschoolteachers,It's great for all ages. I uses it sixth to eight and used it for programming lessons for high school. I know another teacher in my state that uses it with kindergarten to 6th grade.  They will have 15 to 20 kids on at a time.  Another teacher I know set it up as a station for fourth graders and two or three of them would work on projects. One project was to replicate the Jamestown settlement. 
highschoolteachers,"I'm an undergrad (and not an education major) but I hope to be a teacher someday. I've always had quite a few teachers I really looked up to...usually math/science/language teachers. In junior high I thought my math teacher was the coolest person ever, so naturally I wanted to become a math teacher. When I got to high school, I had two amazing science teachers. Then I wanted to teach science (chem or physical science). Now in college, I had an organic chemistry professor who is probably the best teacher I've ever had. This guy cares about students so much, and truly wants them to succeed. He will answer any questions students throw at him, even when they're not in his classes anymore. On top of that, he's hilarious. I've never met a student of his who didn't love him. 

So...after I finished ochem, I began tutoring it through my university's free tutoring program. I had never had so much fun. I did it as much as I could. I met great people and learned so much. It was fun to watch my students do well in their classes (often better than I had done!) and I loved hearing their excitement about a great test score or whatever.

This semester, I am a TA for my organic professor's class. It's the coolest thing for me. During training, all the new TAs (1st year grad students and me) had to do a practice discussion for the group and some experienced TAs/lecturers. Mine was about stuff I had learned in his classes, and he was there watching. After I finished, he said something like, ""When you showed [important chem topic], I was so proud."" That feel. I'll never forget it.

There's just something awesome about helping people learn and seeing their faces light up when they figure something out. There's not a better feeling in the world. Plus, when people come to ask questions at office hours or after class, it's wonderful. Yay, they trust me!"
highschoolteachers,"So apparently my original match never retrieved my info, and I was automatically re-matched. Well my re-match is pretty much the most amazing person ever.  I am an English and Socials junior high and high school teacher, and earlier this week I received a GIANT box of BOOKS. Brand new books!  32 of them!  Novels, non-fiction, short stories, history, graphic novels... it was crazy.  I cried. They all came from Ben McNally bookstore in Toronto, Ontario (so if you can go there, do!  It sounds amazing!). Then a few days later ANOTHER parcel arrived filled with markers, construction paper, whiteboard markers, pencils, flags, more stuff and candy!  Thank you SO much internet stranger -- you rock!"
highschoolteachers,"Warning wall of text(side effect of being an English teacher)

The kid is old enough to know that he has an issue, so make sure you educate him on how to handle it. Ask him what he wants to do after high school. Explain that in the real adult world you can't disrupt meetings, can't be the class clown, so he needs coping skills to live with his ADHD.

Then explain that you are going to start coaching him on how to handle his ADHD and be productive. These are the things that I use with my ADHD kids:

They run all of my errands. If they need to get out and walk off some energy, I will make up a pre arragend errand with another teacher so they know that I have a kid just walking off energy.

They are the classroom helpers.

If they need to stand to work, they can, as long as the don't bother anyone

When they are having a really bad day, they let me know ahead of time and take a few min to gain control, go get water, or make a lap around campus. 

Caffeine. Where I teach many of the families don't have consistent access to health care, or can't afford medicine. Most of the ADHD meds are stimulants, so caffeine can help calm them down. I tell the students to ask their parents about having a soda or coffee in the morning.

Also, morning exercise is helpful.

I also have them reflect about their ADHD behavior and see if they can figure out their triggers and what works for them. It is much harder with 9th graders, but can be done. 

With all of these things, lots and lots of praise when they complete the task, and work well in class.

Lots of reflection, talking with the kid, ask how they are doing in other classes, have the student share what works well in your class with other teachers. Make him aware of his progress, and share the success with his parents.

And email his coach about how much he has become a great helper in your class and how well he is working. This will make the kid love you and he will do whatever you want. Teaching is mostly building the relationships with kids so they respect you, once you have that, then you can teach the content. The other kids will respect and realize that you can make the class clown be productive and not bother them.

EDIT--Reddit Gold!! Thank you so much!!"
highschoolteachers,"My district is bringing vocational education back. For a long time high schoolers have been able to bus across town to local community colleges to take some tech Ed classes, but now we're building them into our high schools. My kids' school is adding construction and automotive trades next year and cyber security in the next few years. Other schools in the district offer a CNA type program and something else I can't think of off the top of my head. "
highschoolteachers,"I've always struggled with math, it never clicked in my head like it should. I've always excelled at reading, language arts, history, and pretty much anything that didn't involve math though. In high school, I wanted to take AP classes because I was bored in my classes (had 95+ in everything other than math and science) and figured earning some college credits wouldn't hurt. I was told I couldn't because my math score wasn't high enough. 

That was the first time I realized something was fundamentally flawed with our education system. "
highschoolteachers,"Get experience working with students in a remedial setting where they are actively working against their own success as students and your success as a teacher. 

&gt;Also, is it common to go back to your own high school to teach?

Kind of, but i would only recommend it if you come from an underrepresented, historically marginalized background.

&gt;Basically I'm just interested in any tips you guys have to offer to improve my odds (as to what would make me most qualified and give me some good exposure).

Volunteer with an educational non-profit that works with low-income students, and/or substitute teach in a low income school district. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school.

When I taught 8th grade science, I had 30ish kids in a class that tested everywhere from 1st grade to college level readers. I had to teach physics to students that couldn't add at the same time I had to teach students who spent their mornings travelling to the high school to take math classes at a higher level than what we could offer in our school.

Part of a school's success is measured by how much they discipline students. Which doesn't mean we use more effective behavior management, it means we just don't actually discipline anyone for anything less than a felony, so the numbers of suspensions looks great when the board is looking at their terrible school success metrics. We pull the kid out of class for 5 minutes give him/her a stern talking to, and send them right back to the class where they continue stopping any learning from happening. I've literally had kids fight in class, throw chairs, etc... and you think they're suspended, but what's actually happening is that the admin tells the parent to call them out of school for a few days so they're still out of school, but it's not adding to their behavior statistics.
"
highschoolteachers,"I've long been a proponent of tracking in high school. I think we need to start differentiating graduation requirements to offer college prep diplomas, vocational diplomas, and the opportunity to work with guidance counselors to create hybrid diplomas. Our standard requirements for a diploma don't meet everybody's needs."
highschoolteachers,This practice predates NCLB. I'm 40 and recall graduating high school with peers who couldn't communicate in English.
highschoolteachers,"None!

Total $20 to Starbucks and $25 to Target, and lots of sweet treats.

I sampled the treats (which were awesome, but WAY too much for me to eat by myself) and brought them to the Y where I work for the high school and college aged kids to demolish, which they did promptly."
highschoolteachers,honestly I have no idea.  All i know is we are not allowed to hold students back before high school and it causes severe problems.  I get yelled at by high school teachers for students being unprepared when I knew that was going to happen and recommended they don't move on because of it.
highschoolteachers,"Several years ago a friend lost her son in a traffic accident, less than a year after graduating high school.  At his memorial service many folks shared stories, and many of the best were from his teachers.

Those stories got us all laughing, as each story nudged the recall of another, as if each teacher was trying to top the others.  Nearly all of the stories were new to everyone there, including his mom, but well-known within school.  Not all the stories were flattering!  But all were sweet and/or funny, and all were greatly appreciated.

It is important to continually know that teachers sometimes see kids more than their working parents, and certainly see sides of their lives unknown at home.

Make an effort to remember the stories, of all kinds.  Just in case they're needed (if only for your own memoirs)."
highschoolteachers,"The school doesn't matter as much as the level of students you're teaching. I had a far more enjoyable experience teaching Algebra to 8th graders at a low-income school vs teaching Algebra to 9th graders at a wealthy suburban high school. Wherever you want to decide to teach, ask to see the master schedule before you accept any offer to see if they truly value you and are putting you in a position to succeed.

The biggest issue with the low-income schools is caused by admin consistently giving new hires the most challenging, lowest performing students in an effort to maintain their current staff. We had almost all new teachers leave for greener pastures after their first year, creating an endless cycle of re-hiring that is becoming more challenging as fewer people express interest in this profession."
highschoolteachers,"Whenever possible, make things a competition. Kids really thrive on it overall. ""Which group will line up the quietest?"" ""Let's see if the boys or girls get their whiteboards out the fastest"" Works for high school too, but competition between periods. Competition is a great motivational tool. It can have a prize but really doesn't have to. Just ""winning"" is often enough."
highschoolteachers,"For my first year high school students I lay out the rules on Day 1 and always make sure to enforce them as fairly and consistently as I possible. Don't make the rules overly complicated, and don't allow things to slide. 

For second year high schoolers I allow them to make up the rules in terms of what is acceptable and what the punishments should be. I've found that when I do this the students are much more motivated to police each other."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;does one marking period grade in 5th grade even matter in life??? 

It matters when entering middle or high school.  When I moved to a new school for my middle school years, some kids entered pre-algebra and a literature course, and other kids entered courses below that level. Do well, and students could leave middle school with algebra completed, while other students entered high school needing to take algebra.

 My own kids are in a small K-8 school without differentiated learning. So the only thing within the school that matters is whether they progress to the next grade level.

In the transition to high school, incoming students from my kids' K-8 school are placed into high school courses based on teacher recommendation. So their 8th grade teacher's opinion of their language arts and math abilities dictates their high school track unless a parent makes a fuss about getting some other form of assessment."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;shake their hands

I understand the point behind this. I also understand that high school students don't wash their hands after shitting. "
highschoolteachers,I started getting them in 4th grade. I didn't have a GPA calculated until middle school and my GPA didn't really matter until high school (and even that didn't matter once college was underway). I'm about the same age as you.
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for the encouragement!  I am in an accelerated (15 months) Master's program (I have my bachelor's in Biology with a minor in Chemistry), which is part of the nervousness we are all feeling in our program.  We have had 2 semesters (if you count the summer and winter as one semester) of pedagogy courses and will be student teaching the whole semester (two placements) in the Spring.  I feel that we are all very well prepared, however.  In the second half of the fall semester we did all of our field observation hours (100 hours required in the semester) with the teachers that we will be student teaching with, which helps a lot.  I know the students, ahead of time, I know the content I will be teaching, already, and we have been working on EdTPA style learning segments.  I was also able to make a very good impression with both teachers and have taught some of their lessons to the classes at this point.  They have both told me that I can use as much or as little of their materials as I want, though there are mandated assessments that I have to teach to in my second placement.  I will definitely use some of the material from my first CT, but I am not a huge fan of how much my second CT dumbs the material down for her classes (they get very bored and act up, among other issues).  It is a high school science class, afterall.

The science EdTPA does have a bit of crossover with other EDTPA formats, you are correct.  We have to have a lot of focus on inquiry-based learning.  We have a local, national board certified, science teacher teaching our methods courses and a seminar next semester where we work on improving our teaching and work on our EdTPA materials.  She has been a tremendous help and emphasized using the EdTPA language and following the rubric, as well.  I have definitely kept all of my textbooks and will (and have, already) use them while planning.  Did you use the Woolfolk Ed Psych book, by chance?  

We are a very close-knit group in our program (there are only 5 of us, now), so we will definitely be doing a lot peer-review and probably some peer-counseling, as well, lol.  "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; parent is questioning all of my weighting and re-weighting my assignments

Is this something set by your district or campus? If so, nothing you can do. And it certainly wouldn't be fair to change grade weights for him because that would affect all of your other students. I assume that she wants you to change them just for her little snowflake, but that's really not something you can - and certainly absolutely not something you should - do.  

Stop interacting until you get back from break. Yeah, it sucks that you have this hanging over you. But there's nothing you can do right now. And she's free to take it upstream. Sounds like it's pretty well documented. Hopefully you have an admin that will back you. 

I can understand the issue between a B and C in high school since there are GPA implications. Does a B vs C even matter in 5th grade? "
highschoolteachers,"i only do middle and high school, but as someone who had no real teaching experience whatsoever a before subbing, i love it! at least where i teach, kids are way nicer to subs than i remember/than people act like they are. plus you get to see new kids every day, and generally the younger kids are, the friendlier they are, in my experience. usually teachers are pretty good at leaving instructions but in the instances where the teacher left you literally nothing (i hope this won’t happen as much in elementary...) it’s only one day to get through and you’re done."
highschoolteachers,"Multiple choice questions can be used as an effective teaching tool to make sure kids know how to make good decisions with the content you are teaching.

For high school ELA, I'll ask stuff like:

* Which of the following claims does the author not support with evidence:
* Which of the following pieces of evidence would best support the author's claim that _______:
* Which of the following best describes what the author communicated with the word _______:

I'll avoid recall questions unless they are really comprehension questions:

* NOT: What color suit did Gatsby wear in chapter seven?
* INSTEAD: Match each of the following clothing choices with the character traits Fitzgerald intended them to convey:

I didn't use any multiple choice until my third year but now I kind of like it; but that's probably because I used it to fill gaps in my teaching practice rather than as a foundation. I was also never forced to use it as part of a curriculum map. 

In any event, most districts that do well on state tests will happily tell you that they don't teach to the test or teach around multiple choice especially."
highschoolteachers,Starting my student teaching January 2nd for high school social studies! Hope to hear similar things!! 
highschoolteachers,"I've gotten sick during winter break every year since high school. I thought that maybe this would be the year I'd beat it since I was feeling fine for the first few days-but nope, an awful awful cold hit me  hard Wednesday night. Been miserable ever since. "
highschoolteachers,I taught 6th grade last year. I learned quickly that I am not cut out for that. I am back to doing high school and I am very happy. Middle school is less content and more teaching 25 kids how to be less shitty. I don't have the patience for that. 
highschoolteachers,"I usually get a few things, but I have kids for all 4 years of high school."
highschoolteachers,"It's been years since I have read that book, but I remember thinking it was mostly common sense stuff and nothing particularly inspiring.  I do believe that when I rented the book from my library, it came with a DVD which was twenty times more helpful than the entire book.

If I recall correctly, it was essentially set up like a TED talk where this experienced teacher described her classroom management techniques.  I think she taught either middle or high school, not sure, but it was applicable to any grade and she was amazing.  Even my wife got really in watching it with me.  Just looked it up, the speaker's name is Chelonnda Seroyer but the video is not anywhere online unfortunately."
highschoolteachers,"You have to love kids. Don't get in this profession because you love math. The students you will be working with your first few years won't love math. They won't study. They won't practice. They want to do the least amount of work to earn a D to avoid summer school. They've coasted through a system that has passed them on without being held accountable to knowing the material. 

Every high school has the same complaints. ""The kids don't know their integer operations... I teach them equations, and they mess up -5 + 13."" Note that this isn't all high school students, but the bottom 20% which every administrator assigns to the new teacher in order to maintain the rest of the staff.

Not until years of work and politicking are you rewarded with the responsibility of teaching students who genuinely like math. At most high schools you will notice that the Calculus teacher is the person who has been at the school the longest. Ditto for AP/Honors teachers."
highschoolteachers,"Remind them that college admin offices pull transcripts in the spring at least twice. They rescind offers to students whose grades drop or have behavioral issues. 

This Happened to a guy I knew in high school. Got into Cornell in October. Was scrambling to get accepted to an in state school in May because they revoked his offer. He was pulling Cs and Fs at semester. His spring grades were atrocious. 

Later, when I worked in my college’s admissions office, the admissions officers talked the student workers through the whole process since many of us were curious about how we were selected. This confirmed that they do contact the school after acceptance rounds to see if they need to revoke an offer. 

That may be the only motivator if they’re planning on college. "
highschoolteachers,I teach high school so we don't have to do dismissals but I still keep the gift school branded umbrella in my classroom. It is great for when we have a fire alarm on a rainy day. 
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school but I also notice most students do not study. A few have told me that they have just gone through school and passing tests based on just what they remember in school, so they don't really know how to study.

I do two things. I do review games in class and give students the study guide ahead of time. If students fail, they can do quiz corrections up to 75% but they have to figure out the correct answer, where they got the answer from their notes, and explain their misunderstandings. It is a lot of work to do test corrections so students are learning to study ahead of time to avoid it. "
highschoolteachers,"Get out! Start applying! If I had to teach lower than high school, I think I would find a different career."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher with over 110 students, I get zero gifts from parents or students.  "
highschoolteachers,"Schools can vary wildly depending on what district or neighborhood you're working in. You would really have to sub in a couple of other districts for a time to see if it's you that can't handle it. or if it's them, the 7th graders. 

I suspect it's them. 

I don't know what to tell you. Apply for jobs in a better area? Stay in your district and aim for high school? I don't know. But be assured, the problem is probably not you. 

Yes, if they had a scary, intimidating teacher in there the 7th graders would probably be more obedient. But being scary doesn't equal being a GOOD TEACHER. They are not automatically congruent. 

It's a tough call. But I like the idea of the punishment being sitting with heads down, or staring forward, for the whole period. There is nothing so cruel as boredom to an adolescent. ;-)"
highschoolteachers,"When I attended high school (Title 1, low income area), the nurse kept a stock pile in her office. Unfortunately, so many girls would take advantage of it and began to steal boxes. They now are no longer allowing girls to take more than one-two due to how bad the theft got. 

The school I teach at now doesn't even have dispenseners in the restrooms. "
highschoolteachers,I would never ever ever teach middle school. I think it takes a certain type of person and that person is not me. I love high school tenth grade is where I shine! 
highschoolteachers,"I had to teach one 7th grade class along with my high school classes for the last 2 years, but not this year. I don't miss it."
highschoolteachers,"Australian ""middle school"" (usually integrated into high school) starts at what I believe is US grade 8 (13 year olds). I think it's a better point to divide them - US grade 7 is still part of primary school."
highschoolteachers,"That makes me think about how many of the social studies teaches at the high school I graduated from, were coaches...
Most of them.

The school I went to is large enough for that not to be required..."
highschoolteachers,"Yes. I'd like to peruse these lesson plans, even though I teach high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I would be interested to hear about how you go about this discussion! I have had similar talks with my high school students but I still get the ""why are we learning this?/we're never going to use this"" excuse for not paying attention or doing work."
highschoolteachers,"Oh thank goodness, I was starting to think I was the only high school teacher in the world needing to use the phrase ""use your words"".  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school child development so we have a fully functioning preschool that high schoolers teach but I ""run"". I don't let the 4 year olds get away with that."
highschoolteachers,"I also teach high school and I teach them MS Office software. Last week to test their letter formatting skills, they had to write an official letter to Santa. They loved every second of it. Most knew Santa isn’t a real guy, but you would’ve never known by their letters!"
highschoolteachers,"I take the opposite approach. I teach high school, and insist that Santa is real (almost to the point of that SNL skit with Ryan Gosling where he gets to meet Santa).

They can't believe their teacher is seriously insisting on it, and try to reason with me and prove that Santa isn't real. They bring up the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny as examples, and say that it's the same as Santa. But it's not. Because the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny aren't real, but Santa is."
highschoolteachers,"They can't do observations at my school this close to break per contract rules but they can be in rooms and give reprimands if teachers aren't doing their jobs (and support teachers by giving students immediate admin consequences for acting out).

At my school, they sent out an email notifying us it was a real school day (not this phrasing) and that they'd be coming around. They also sent an all-call message and email to the parents to let them know real instruction was happening. 

I'm fine with it. It's high school and the kids should be getting instruction every day (I can see holiday activities in elementary perhaps - different world) and I use the day for real instruction anyway (something the kids can handle but still a meaningful lesson I'd spend a day on) because I literally can't afford to lose days with 50 minute periods and teaching high school English. Too much to do! They never stop by my room, though, because I'm instructing and they know it. They stop by the rooms of those teachers who make it harder for everyone because they are giving the kids free days or watching Charlie Brown in math. I like that they police it. Means I get less kids who come in saying ""What? No one else gave me work!"" and ruin my spirits when I've planned an engaging but meaningful lesson. "
highschoolteachers,"I was thinking 13 isn't so old, until I realized I was a freshman in high school when I was 13. Definitely didn't believe in Santa then."
highschoolteachers,"If they did the PSAT this fall, then they should have specific recommendations on what they need to work on from Khan Academy through College Board.

Your school sounds like mine, so this is just a band-aid. ""What they need to work on"" is everything. When there are juniors in Alg. II taking the PSAT who don't know their times tables...it's delusional that Khan is going to help them all that much (despite the insistence from my clueless administrators). But, when their math skills are that atrocious, I honestly don't know what else to do. An hour a week for, what, twelve weeks before the SAT is too little, too late. But it's the most admin are going to give us, because they're in denial about the depth of the problem. The SAT math directly tests the Alg I/I and Geometry curricula. We should not have students passing high school math classes and getting 400s on the SAT. 

Sorry to be so defeatist. We're ""developing"" SAT prep at my school right now, and it makes me absolutely furious that our admin think the poor scores (when they bother to think about them at all) can be resolved with 12-15 hours of SAT ""prep,"" rather than a serious reconsideration of why our students are performing so poorly in the first place.
"
highschoolteachers,"High school social studies. Parent was furious at me that I told their 14 year old that Santa is not a real historical figure. “It is history! History is the past! The past of a child’s innocence and wonder!”

I so wish they had asked for a meeting so I could explain to admin that we were gathered together because I told a high school student Santa isn’t real."
highschoolteachers,Okay thank you for the detailed answer. I’m also signing up to work with my college’s TRIO program which will let me tutor and work with high school students in a classroom-type setting.
highschoolteachers,"If it’s something you’re interested in, it won’t hurt. A job’s a job, and if you can leave college with less debt, thats always a good plan. A job like that will also give you a potential reference which opens you up to other possible teaching opportunities, especially if an employer is dubious about hiring someone with no experience or track record of being a decent employee/trustworthy with kids.

That said, that sounds like a very different set of skills. In a regular teaching job, you won’t have the luxury of doing a walk and talk with high school students about something they have a vested interest in learning. Orientation doesn’t require the kind of classroom management and differentiation you will get with working but in a classroom.

In other words, don’t pass up a classroom opportunity for an orientation job, but take it if it’s short term, part-time, and/or you have no other current leads."
highschoolteachers,I was debating bringing this up with high school kids. Yea I believe it lol.
highschoolteachers,"I have taught 5th grade through high school, and every year, no matter the age, I start  off with a discussion of what education actually is, and what innocence is. Innocence is the belief that the world is a simple, happy, easy to understand place, the acceptance of things at face value without seeing the complications below the surface. And education is the process of disabusing yourself of those misconceptions. We talk about Wittgenstein's ladder and how much of what you learn in school are frameworks of conceptualizing reality that are so over-simple that latter they will regard them as false (""Your teachers like to you every day."") We talk about more accurate vs less accurate models of reality, about epistemology and deconstructionism. That sets the tone for the rest of the year, and it becomes a meme for the students, whenever their minds get blown, to say, ""Mr. infinitum17, you're destroying my childhood innocence!"" and I look gravely back at them and say faux-harshly, ""*that's my job.*"" I love teaching."
highschoolteachers,"And much better that lesson is learned in 7th grade than high school, where an incident like that could keep you out of colleges."
highschoolteachers,"Semi-off topic, but I’m wanting to teach high school. My college offers opportunities to work as Orientation Leaders, which includes leading tours, answering questions, and helping incoming freshmen get an idea of what it’s going to be like. Would this be helpful at all?"
highschoolteachers,"1) Why poetry?

I was an English major all throughout my undergrad, and Poetry just happens to be something my MT was dreading to do since she's not much of a fan - she was originally going to wait until near the end of the year to do poetry, but because of my own background with English and talking with her about what lessons I would be interested in teaching she decided a unit on poetry would be a good fit for me, and I agree. 

I'm honestly not too sure what we want them to learn, she really just told me I would be doing a poetry unit all on my own, and said she would look over the final assignment (since I had to create about 4 different final assignments due to the varied learners in our class). 

2) I mostly plan to push the whole ""We're going to have a literary cafe at the end with snacks and hot chocolate it's gonna be great!"" - i don't really have much of a plan but am banking on the fact that they seem to like me enough to be interested in what I'm going to do with them. For every poetry type I do plan to give them topics to write their poems on (for Haiku I was going to get them to write a haiku about vampires), and pick fun topics for each type of poem (I plan to show them Daniel Radcliffe's cover of Blackalicious' Alphabet Aerobics because I'm a huge HP fan *and* he censors out the N word). 

I don't have too much experience being in front of a class and teaching, so I was hoping my prompts and giving them interesting topics for their poems would be enough to get them/keep them interested. 

3) I chose to do alliterative before acrostic because I personally feel acrostic is easier to do, and I just threw it in last minute because I thought it was a fun form of poetry the kids could learn and have fun with, as opposed to Alliterative because alliteration is important to know when you hit high school. 

If it's not too much trouble I would love to see what you have in your folder of poetry! I appreciate it so much!! 

And I was absolutely going to introduce that not all poems rhyme and some have structures with the Haiku/Tanka - which have specific structures, and do not rhyme. "
highschoolteachers,"No she had a great teacher last year in kindergarten. This student is one of the top in my class actually. She’s definitely not slipping in any of her subjects. This Mom has given me a lot of trouble this year so I’m not surprised by her email at all, I’m just tired of it. 

Our county gives grades but they’re different letter grades than middle and high school ( I think they stand for something but no one ever says what or mentions that part). 

E - 90-100
S+ - 80-90
S - 70-80
N - 60-70
U- 50-0 

I mean, my original post sounds like I’m overreacting I’ll admit. But sometimes I just don’t get why parents care so much about these little tiny grade disputes (ESPECIALLY in 1st grade when they’re only 6 and 7). I think we should be focusing on more character building and why her child has a mean-girl attitude at school instead of things that are already more than fine. "
highschoolteachers,"it isn't really much different at the high school level, even though supposedly the students are supposed to be a lot more responsible for their own grades by then...
I feel your pain."
highschoolteachers,"I'm high school SpEd. There's a kid in one class (a freshman) who is ridiculously witty and intelligent (he probably will be indirect by next year). He's also very level-headed and respectful and the size of a football player. When he's in class, he stops all bullying or disrespect in its tracks. He's basically the classroom manager. He gets checked out early on a regular basis because (I think) his family only has one car. I HATE when he leaves. The class is a circus and he's the ring-leader. Plus he's the only one that laughs at my sarcastic jokes."
highschoolteachers,"I love raccoontrashfire’s ideas. That is a great schedule. I would add these ideas for your consideration as well. 

1. Get your principal to sign off buying books. You need sets of high interest nonfiction texts at these kids’ levels. You need good books from which you can plan good lessons. Using other sources from time to time is great, but you need books. Especially if you have to fill four hours a week!!!!! National Geographic has awesome books. Can’t think off the top of my head where else we have books from in our book room, but you can probably find good ones on Amazon. I often buy sets for my classroom on Amazon and get reimbursed. 

2. Can you also add a test taking strategies component, or is that going to fall into the helping with schoolwork category? I have done tutoring after school with my students and one aspect was test prep. We would do a sample passage as a group in a guided format (I would model as they followed along and gave suggestions about what to do next). Then we did questions together. Usually we would focus on one skill per week because we had a short time frame. 

3. Fluency. My kids really need this as they are often more than one grade level below. Since you have some well below grade level, I’m guessing their fluency even at that level is probably pretty low. I would hit this hard for 10-15 minutes each time. You can do timed repeated readings of a text (one of their books or if you have access to something like Reading A to Z, they have leveled fluency passages). Reading A to Z also has a wide range of leveled books you can download (I would think their highest level hits 9th grade, but someone can correct me if I’m wrong.). It is a paid subscription, though, that you would want school to pick up. Or you can try to find readers theaters, if the kids go for it and aren’t too cool for that at that age. There’s a lot of research about the connection between fluency and overall reading growth. Again, I don’t know how you would do it with high school kids. Use your own judgment there. 

I’m coming at it from a lower grade, but I have had great success with my tutoring program (but I typically tutored my kids and kids on my grade level team who I knew very well). We tracked their data weekly and my teammates helped give suggestions for plans as I went along depending on how the kids were doing. Anyway, hope these ideas are helpful."
highschoolteachers,"I am 24 and in my 3rd year teaching high school English and I absolutely love my job. It isn’t always easy and there are really tough days, but I think it’s the greatest job there is. I love all 150 of my kids (okay well maybe 147 of them, lol) and look forward to going to work almost every day. 

I know everyone is always talking about spending 12 hours at work each day and whatnot, but there’s no reason you have to do that. I spend 2 hours on Sundays prepping for the week and I leave work by 4 everyday and don’t take anything home. It’s all about finding your rhythm and what works for you. Please don’t give up on this goal (something you obviously want to do if you majored in it). Remember...a lot of us only post when we have had rough days. The good days are there too, they just don’t need venting so they go unposted. "
highschoolteachers,"I know it doesn't sound nice....I am aware of how condescending it is.

But, most of these kids are reading at 5~6 grade level below, can't do single digit addition / subtraction without using calculator...I don't think they should go to 4 year college.  Not because they can't go.  Let's be honest here, here are plenty of shady private colleges that would literally accept anybody.(And that's where most of my students would end up if they are going to college. )  When they go to college, they would be stuck in remedial courses they couldn't pass in high school. (They couldn't even pass algebra 1 STAAR exam.)   By the end of their college, they would only pile themselves on predatory student loan without being attaining education/training to pay it back.  Hence, time &amp; money spent on college actually works AGAINST their interest.

If anything, one of my kiddo who knew he wasn't college material, and going into electrician apprenticeship after graduating from high school is making a right move.  He actually likes those hands-on activities, and he's been helping his family's business on fixing houses.


"
highschoolteachers,Please tell me you teach high school haha
highschoolteachers,"When I subbed high school I would tell the kids who were off task to “at least ‘pretend’ like you’re working....that way it a teacher comes in it looks like I’m doing my job.”  The kids thought it was funny and would end up doing some of their work. I think it worked because it put myself and the student on a the same team rather than me vs. them. 

You could sit behind them so you can always see their screen. An English teacher at my school rearranges the desks so everyone is facing the wall so she can see all screens at any time. Also, facing the wall means there are fewer inadvertent distractions. Maybe don’t rearrange a teacher’s room though. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes, you CAN have actual discussions, however you will also have to accept that the majority of your time teaching will not be waxing poetic about life. There are so many standards that you must address and so many responsibilities that will leave you feeling disillusioned about your summer camp and college orientation experiences. 

You will have to teach them how to write, and some will still be confusing your and you're, two, to, and too, and why ""irregardless"" is redundant. Actually, you'll have to explain what it means to be redundant.

You'll have to show them how to organize the word vomit coming out of their brains as they try to form their own opinion.

You'll have to convince a high school student with a 7th grade reading level to engage with Fahrenheit 451.

These are just a minuscule portion of what an English teacher is responsible for covering. If your plan is to do more lecturing as a way of leading students to an AHA! moment, then no, it's not realistic. 

If you think books will be the window into each student's soul, then you will find yourself extremely frustrated. You'll get so excited at a certain point in a story, and some of your students will stare back with stoicism.

You're going to have to be willing to be hands-on, differentiate your instruction for varying levels, make your content relatable and relevant, while also providing rigor.

Teaching is no joke, and it's difficult. If you're willing to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty, it's an amazingly rewarding job. If you're envisioning it being similar to Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society,"" then I would reconsider."
highschoolteachers,"One of my high school kids, who a lot of teachers intensely dislike because he is an ass in other rooms, is a total sweetheart in mine. Funny, witty, a little darkly humored and deeply sarcastic. He has fantastic artistic abilities and will make a wonderful tattoo artist someday. When he is gone, the room is so quiet that it is eerie."
highschoolteachers,"God, I loved days like that subbing high school. Read articles on the internet, walk around and chat with students about what they're working on, whatever you want. As long as the class stays somewhat in control and you leave some brief note about what happened, that's fine. I got put on people's preferred sub list just for doing that much. And I was never particularly strict...I mean if a kid chooses not to do their work and I'm just subbing, the way I see it it's pretty much their choice and not a battle worth fighting. 

As a teacher, I'm happy with any sub who doesn't leave my room a mess. "
highschoolteachers,This is exactly why I majored in math even though I knew I wanted to be a math teacher since high school. I would have regretted majoring in education. 
highschoolteachers,Wow that’s not fair. This unannounced is worth 10% so the 90% of announced ones I was fine.  The unannounced has to be done by an outside observer and in this case it’s a high school principal observing the middle school. First off they totally forget what it’s like to be in our shoes and secondly they lose a sense of the adolescence stage that is happening 
highschoolteachers,"I would just get the MAT done. Besides the time is money...how much longer do you want to be in school for?

I did a 4+1 BA/MAT program and the +1 (full-time practicum, full-time coursework) was hell, but it's done and I'm currently weighing job offers right now (high school ESL + content so YMMV). I had a few colleagues at my practicum who had been working as paras for 3-4 years and were just going back to school at 27-28 for 3 year MAT/MSW programs. Not gonna lie, they were having a difficult time getting back into the swing of schoolwork and a few of them mentioned feeling infantilized by spending 3 more years in school. Being 23 and set feels pretty damn good.

Another way I look at it is I don't have the stress of graduate school hanging over me while actually working and teaching. I'll have less burdens on my mind and I can focus my energies towards actually improving my practice. "
highschoolteachers,"Many middle schools like to have one teacher for both subjects to give the kids a bit more of an elementary-school-like environment, with less moving around between classes and between teachers. Especially for sixth grade (or whatever the youngest middle school grade is in the district; it can vary). 

In the part of California where I grew up they moved sixth grade from elementary to middle school about 15 years ago (I was in high school at the time), and they put a lot of these types of things in place to alleviate concerns that sixth graders were not ready for a full-on, different teacher every class middle school environment.

At the (private, 6-12) school where I currently teach, we have one teacher for both English and History in the sixth grade; she is the only teacher at the school who has a multiple-subject credential, while everyone else has either a single-subject or an advanced degree in their subject area. Other private middle schools that I’ve heard about actually put sixth graders in a single integrated “humanities” class that covers both social studies and ELA, although I don’t know how common that is in public schools."
highschoolteachers,"Sounds to me like you were doing an amazing job. I feel like have a good teacher is something you are always thankful for after awhile. I know I had a  high school teacher that was so hard on us, but after I started my college level courses I was grateful for such a caring teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I just need to vent.

We hired a new science teacher this year, and we became friends really quick. We spent preps talking/collaborating, we did double dates with our spouses throughout the year, and we were super excited to move to our new high school next year.

2 weeks ago they sends a super short email saying thry took a new job next year at the school their mom is principal at. They stopped talking to any of us , is extremely distant, and we found out today they are using their sick days to sub at their new school. I really don't care that they took a new job, but I was hoping to stay friends, but all this is pissing me off beyond belief. It also doesn't help that when a teacher is out, one of our Instructional assistants has to sub shorthanding everyone else."
highschoolteachers,"I completely agree. I've had kids who were absolute terrors who would curse my name when I had them in middle school. One came to visit me when he was in high school to apologize for how he acted when he was in my class. They do grow up, but pre-teens are awful. Just remember that they're ""humans-in-training."""
highschoolteachers,"So I just found out that I didn't get a job that I was really hopeful about. I don't even know what to do, so I'm just going to rant a bit and maybe someone can give me some advice. If not, maybe it will at least make me feel better to type it all out.

At the end of my MAT (2016) I was offered a job by the school I had student taught at (and been hired at for the second half of the year, long story), but I turned it down for a job at a charter school in the town I grew up. I loved the school I student taught at, but I just thought it would be so great to teach in the community where I went to school. 

That charter school ended up being a truly horrific experience and I resigned before the end of October, 2016. Every teacher I knew (including all of my supervisors from grad school, who I trust very much) told me that I needed to get my ass out of there ASAP, so I did. I spent the next three months depressed, feeling very sorry for myself, and regretting leaving my previous school. Then I found a long term job at a really great high school for the last four months of the 2016-17 school year.  

Last summer, a job was posted at the middle school in the same district and everyone I knew at the district told me to apply. They all sent over great references for me, including the principal and assistant principal. I got an interview, went through the whole interview process there, and didn't get the job. The principal told me that I was their second choice, and that they just went with someone with more middle school experience. (I didn't have any middle school experience because I never got to do my middle school practicum... because I accepted the job at the first school I had worked at.) I learned later that my principal at the high school was really upset that they didn't hire me and there was some internal drama because of it. 

For every interview I had last summer (and I didn't have many, because there were so few ELA jobs posted at all), each principal told me that I was their second choice. I always asked if there was something I could do to improve and everyone has told me no, that everything I did was great, but that they were just going with someone with more experience. 

So, I ended up getting another long term sub job for this year in the same district that I taught at last year, and I split my time between the same high school I taught at last year and the middle school that turned me down. I started in October and will finish out the year with these same kids. I love my kids so much but this job has been really isolating and difficult, partly because I'm teaching a subject that I've never taught before. Additionally, many people that I work with have made it very clear that I am temporary and that they aren't interested in creating any sort of relationship with me. It's all been really lonely and I was questioning whether or not I even wanted to teach any more. I finally decided that I really just wanted to find a place where I am teaching language arts and have a permanent position. I don't want to give up on this profession that I used to be so passionate about just because I haven't had good experiences since that first year.

Anyway, in the past month I've been going through this extensive hiring process for a school that I love. Everything was going really really well and it totally seemed like a place where I could finally put down roots. I did my lesson observation for them last Friday, and sent in my post-lesson reflection on Monday. I wasn't happy with my lesson, but I was still kind of hopeful.

Unfortunately, the principal just called me and guess what? I was their second choice and they went with someone with more experience. He said that they were really impressed with me and that I beat out internal candidates, and said that there wasn't anything that I did that I could improve on. 

I'm just feeling so discouraged. I've applied to every single job posted in the metropolitan area I live in... but there are fewer than 10 ELA jobs that have been posted. I've only been called by that one school, almost every other position has been filled. I feel like I'm going to be passed up by every school for someone with more experience. I feel like I'm just going to be stuck with another long term sub job next year where everyone treats me like a second class citizen. 

I guess I don't know why I'm even typing all of this out. Maybe someone else has dealt with the same kind of thing? Maybe there's hope for me yet? 

Sorry to whine."
highschoolteachers,"I graduated with my bachelors in theatre and then took a break from school to travel and work. I really wasn’t 100% sure if I wanted to pursue teaching but now I know that I do. I’ve lost some time - 2 years to be exact so I have to grind at it and get my shit together haha. That’s another thing, I only have a B.A. and to teach high school you need an honours degree so now I have to go back to school to finish some more credits. All this school is annoying but I got to do it to get to where I got to be. I have Theatre and Social Science as teachables. I have some French but I don’t want to teach French in high school. If you have any more advice, please let me know."
highschoolteachers,"I teach or have taught all grades at my 9-12 high school. For the class of 2014 I taught 3 sections when they were freshmen, 3 as sophomores, 3 as juniors and 2 as seniors. By the time they graduated there were just seven kids in the graduating class I never had. It was awesome. I really knew the kids. 

It was great. I didn’t have any issues with management because they already knew. There wasn’t an adjustment period with new kids because I had previously had half the kids in any class and they knew the rules. They were familiar with my style of teaching and my expectations so I could dive quicker into content and do fun stuff earlier and more often. 

The downside was I *really* missed them when they graduated. "
highschoolteachers,"None. 

Some college classes help. I teach English and had a focus on writing workshop in my undergraduate (an English and Marketing degree), and that's very helpful to me. I still use the writing manual from my college writing courses -- and take activities for my students.

I also took a very thorough English grammar class as an English major that helps. My marketing courses taught me some useful things about presentation and persuasion. I have an Education Masters, and it taught me fuck all (no practicum as I was already teaching). There's a few pieces of foundational psychology that are useful to know, but I had learned those in lower level college psychology courses in high school (and more psych classes for my marketing minor). 

I've learned way more from books, academic journals, etc I've self-chosen than curriculum for the courses, which was all fairly basic. "
highschoolteachers,Can confirm.  Was hissed at by a senior is high school last week when I said hello.  
highschoolteachers,"When I came to my current district, it was late in the hiring season (late June) that we moved here and I didn't want to fuck around. I had taught Title 1 before so I went to one of the better Title 1 middle schools in the district, which seemed rough but well-organized, and put my resume in front of the principal. I had applied online to all that was open in the district, and I got a bunch of calls, but I already had a job by the time the calls came in. I got one the same day I walked in (not the contract yet or anything but the offer was basically made). They needed 4 English teachers, I had proven experience in a Title 1 and clearly knew my stuff. 

I worked there for awhile until the district decided to take over the school and micromanage the teachers, then I jumped for a single year to an A middle school. I applied the normal way and chose the first lifeline. I didn't want to go through another ""School Success"" year with the district bullshit because I happened to teach poor kids that didn't test well. 

I was always watching for openings at the high school I currently work at. An AP who worked with me at the Title 1 moved there the year I left the Title 1. He told me there was an opening the year I came over. That's how I got my current position. It's the best HS in the district -- great community, good admin, A school, suburban style community, IB and AP programs galore, etc. 

As a first year teacher, I'd say, take whatever you're offered unless it comes with MAJOR red flags. You can move around in a district once you have tenure or even before in many cases, if it's really bad. My first job was actually overseas and it was a job a friend was leaving and the international school was a little desperate so I got a better job than I probably could have elsewise. My first American job was a hell year teaching remedial reading (not what I was hired for) at a poorly run middle school with a bully of a principal. But I made connections in the district and got a different job for the following year at the first Title 1 I worked at (before moving states to the one I am in now). "
highschoolteachers,"I'm ELA, but I've taught both MS (7th/8th) and HS (10th-12th, but not 9th) and I think high school is better. I think you're pretty right about the pros/cons (though the EOC can be a pro as well as a con because many HS students actually will consider ""you need to learn this for the final exam"" as a valid reason to learn something, I have found). 

Unless you REALLY love the kids you currently have or really love teaming, which is really the biggest benefit of middle school, I think you should go to high school. The behavioral management is easier, the content is deeper, and you can still teach however you want as long as you hit all the stuff that's on your EOC and teach the content. Unless the EOC is really bad (it's FL, so possible, I don't know that exam, but Bio seems hard to screw up), the content on it is probably just the standards you'd have to cover anyway. 

To me, you sound like a high school teacher. There are people who prefer middle school, but that's not how you sound to me here. It's a tiny snippet of you, though, so hard to say for sure. 

Anyway, I think you have a good grasp of the differences. You might want to ask the HS Bio teachers at the school what their experience is like. That may help you decide. "
highschoolteachers,"Got offered two jobs and had to decide between them. Neither was my ideal. Different districts.

Job A - middle school. ELA. Two preps. Block schedule. Interviewed with principal and most of the department. School starts at 8:30. 20-40 minute drive. 

Job B - high school. Social Studies. Unknown preps. Interviewed with an AP and one teacher. Starts at 7:30. Rotational schedule. 30-50 minute drive. 

I chose A even though I think my ideal position would be high school social studies because I liked the school better. It's smaller, I liked the staff that I met. As a new teacher, they had better support in place. I am also making more money with School A and the district has more salary steps. "
highschoolteachers,"I've taught both and I currently teach high school and will be adding 7th grade back in next year. This is my perspective on it, but understand I went into teaching to be a middle school teacher or a bio teacher but found I love teaching 8th grade physical science and JS Earth science the most, so I might be nothing like you. 

Pros MS: still very silly and willing to be silly in class, which can be very fun with labs and such. Very easy to manage and still interested in your opinion as the teacher. They are still excited to do new things and this might be their first chance at life science. You've created the curriculum and get to coteach, which is so much better for student learning and teacher job satisfaction. More parental support, less student apathy. 

Pros HS; they are more adult but still can be silly if you approach it right. They can take it more seriously since it's now units and not just promotion. They have a higher capacity for abstract thought. The material is what you have more experience with. End of course test could give you more feedback on what you need to improve over time. Less parental involvement. More student strong personal feelings about school (Both good and bad). 

So I teach both and love both for different reasons. However, if you're happy where you are, stay. You keep calling moving to HS upgrading though, so that sounds like you want to move up. "
highschoolteachers,"My masters program referred me to a school, and the principal hired me on the spot. I left the school after a yesr to jump from middle school to high school but stayed in the district.

I like teaching challenging students. I'll stay here until they no longer want me! "
highschoolteachers,"Might be harder with high schoolers, it works wonders with my middle schoolers but you’d be surprised what simple little things mean to teenagers. 

I usually go with candy. Works great, everyone likes free candy. At the end of the year if he’s doing bad and you think he’d even deserve it, a few points extra credit for doing slightly “better” at the end of the school year. Chips and other kinds of snacks work too and if it’s just for one student it’s cheap too. "
highschoolteachers,"My initial certification was in History...as was most of the other people in my teacher certification program.  My first job fair I went to they looked at my resume and said, ""History...so what do you coach?""  I was a band member in high school!  (This was Texas too btw) I left the career fair feeling very discouraged.  One of the ladies in the program got hired on at the school she student taught in and was also willing to teach AP classes...anther guy got a job but he was also willing to coach.  

I could not find a job.  I took a job as a Special Ed teacher's aide at a high school to get more experience and to finish my Master's.  I also taught a home bound student after school to help pay the bills.  During that time I also got certified in Special Education.  I went to the same job fair the following year and received an on the spot offer and multiple interviews...for special ed.   

If you are wanting to do high school then you need to find a way to make yourself stand out.  They often want people to fill multiple roles or provide something extra to the school and the students...could you coach debate?  Mock UN?  A sport?   Offer to help with the newspaper?  As a special ed teacher I was the Gamer's Club sponsor.

I'm not going to lie...social studies can be competitive!  But...people get hired for it every day!  Keep trying...if it doesn't happen, find other ways to gain more experience and try again next year.  

  "
highschoolteachers,"I’ve been teaching in big high schools for a long time. Big schools usually mean a lot of diversity among the staff, students, and extracurricular activities. If a school is big enough, there’s a “home” for everyone."
highschoolteachers,"This is totally BS, why is she out because of what a kid said. Just for allegedly cussing unless she cussed at a kid. Teachers occasionally curse at my school. Just talked to and told to stop doing it. I work at a poor high school."
highschoolteachers,"It really depends. 

Reasons why college classes are harder: 

1.\) College professors generally are not trained in teaching, and often times don't want to be teaching. It is a ""chore"" for them to do that allows them to have a position that allows them to do research. Sometimes their idea of ""think critically"" is more like ""read my mind"" or ""know to look up this information that you have no idea exists."" TAs can be even worse because they are trying to make ends meat while trying to get research done.

2.\) Colleges don't care about you learning. \(Generally.\) They care about making sure a certain percentage of people pass the class, a certain percentage fail, and depending on the subject try to make ""passing"" have to do with some sort of standard set by some organization. Chemistry departments try to keep in line with the American Chemical Society, for example.

3.\) Colleges tend to have a ""eff you"" attitude. Have another class during office hours? Tough luck. No help for you. Given the crappy equipment in lab? Oh well, you get an F.

4.\) Everything costs money. And if anything goes wrong, it's YOUR fault. Doesn't matter if it actually is your fault, it's still your fault.

Reasons why AP classes are harder:

1.\) Your instructor doesn't know what is going to be on the AP test. They have a general idea, but nothing specific. They don't have any input on it.

2.\) You are still considered a minor, and are given no control over your daily schedule. That worthless class that you could ditch everyday and still get an A? You have to go! It's the law......

3.\) Generally, you have much less freedom of ""when"" or ""how"" to do homework. \(Although I can point to a few classes I had in college that were even more restrictive than high school.\) 

4.\) You are in a smaller class, which means less likelihood of finding someone else with the same learning style as you to study with.

5.\) Generally, you don't have big blocks of time to retreat to the library and study for 5 hours straight."
highschoolteachers,"Yep, totally varies. I'm in Michigan, and here to go into secondary education (meaning teaching grades 6-12) you must have a subject degree and then add on an education certification. So I have a bachelor's degree in English with a minor in psychology, plus my secondary education certification. That means I can teach English or psychology (and ONLY those two subjects) in a middle or high school."
highschoolteachers,"Not high school, but middle school with the same lack of independence with some groups. First I set the tone at the beginning of the year that certain activities are silent, independent work, where they cannot ask questions. I reinforce these expectations and redirect students who forget or ""forget"" these expectations. After a few weeks, students fall into a routine. Second, on certain content I know there will be a lot of confusion and lack of confidence, so I preface these activities by saying ""Try these problems on your own without asking for help. After 10 minutes of silent, independent work, we'll review together and you can ask any questions you'd like"". I usually collect work before the review so that students are held accountable. With this routine, students start to feel confident in taking risks because they know in advance that they will eventually get to ask a question, or see that others have the same struggles. I give feedback and assess so I know who needs what in the next lessons."
highschoolteachers,"This is a really long comment, and I've found no suitable ""tl;dr"" to put here.  Sorry!

I'm considering a switch from a 30-year engineering career (in computer software and hardware) to teaching high school.

This precise topic of ""teacher qualification"" has been very much on my mind this year, so I decided to test it by doing lots of volunteering at a local high school in multiple subject areas.

First, there was a great need for math tutoring, so I started there.  I'm a VERY strong ""applied"" math person, emphasizing the practical over the theoretical.

Which also means I lack much of the pedagogical.  I took the 3 California CSET Math exams, and failed the first two because I had forgotten the NAMES of many of the axioms and theorems I used (with mastery) on a daily basis, meaning I would have trouble defining, explaining and linking individual concepts for students.

I flipped through a 2-foot tall stack of high school math texts (algebra, geometry, trig, pre-calc) to gain a quick feel for what is presented in what order, how, and why.

Fortunately, I was a tutor, not a teacher, and didn't need to create or present lesson plans.  I needed to see where and how a student was stuck, then find ways to either remove the block, fill in the gap, or navigate around it.  I also worked with different math teachers, and was exposed to their sometimes surprisingly different approaches to the same material.

This has worked wonders for me!  The only time I fail with a math student is when there are external issues I can't help address, but that preclude any focus on math.  In such situations I try to provide a ""safe place"" where math *could* (not must) happen.

I also became a TA in a CS class, an area in which I have deep and broad knowledge and experience, both theoretical and practical.  This allowed me to have very different perspectives for both the teacher and the students.

The CS teacher was pursuing rapid programming success without conceptual depth, a stark contrast to both what I had observed in the math classroom and to what I knew of the underpinnings of CS.  This path is one many follow when trying to pick up programming on their own, and is well enshrined within the Maker community.

Unfortunately, only about 10% of the students were succeeding on the first try, which to me seemed primarily due to pre-existing familiarity with computers and minor amounts of programming.  The class had several students who promptly dropped it because of a massive lack of connection to the subject and/or the teaching approach.

When I tutored the ""lost"" students, I embedded what the teacher had shared within a more math-like structure, defining concepts and showing relationships, but still within the context of developing the program in the lesson plan.  For most (but not all) this worked quite well.

The hardest, for me, was convincing students desiring to leave the course to stay.  I had no clue how to engender the fascination and joy I experience from getting to do CS as a profession, beyond simply relating my own experiences (which does have value).  For many of these students, it's a week-to-week negotiation to keep them trying, while I struggle to find motivational key(s) that will work better for them.

This school also has a large hydroponic garden (with a tilapia pond providing fertilizer) that also has many conventional raised-beds and a small grove of fruit and nut trees.  The goal is for it to become financially self-supporting by selling produce in local farmer's markets, and to provide situational education opportunities in many subject areas, including Economics, Project Management, Agriculture, Food Handling/Services, Retail, and so on.

Several teachers support it, some by teaching relevant classes, and all with extensive time outside school.  There is a lengthy wish list of tasks and goals that simply lack time and personnel to address, and I volunteered to attack some of them.

First was to plumb in some sinks and a solar hot water heater, so the produce could be washed according to food handling standards, something that is required for the food to be legal to sell.  I do my own plumbing mainly because it's fun, and I thought I could take a few students through the process while getting the work accomplished.

Wow.  Adding two students multiplied the schedule by over a factor of TEN!  It took over a month just to get to the point of having a piping plan and a shopping list for Home Depot.  It was clear to me that I had simultaneously managed to over-explain and under-teach, not to mention failing to move the project along.

I shifted to an apprenticeship model, where I gave short work assignments with only the snippets of information needed to get that one job done.  This worked far better, but meant I was doing much more of the work myself, since much of it didn't break down at all well, especially the design work.

Another garden project was to create an alarm system for the hydroponic aerator pumps: When they fail, the fish die within a few days, and the plants within a week.

I had initially thought to bring in a couple of the CS students, but realized this would be well beyond their abilities to help move the project forward.  So I did it myself, using an old cell phone that simply sent a text whenever its charger wasn't supplying power.

I took careful notes, which I am turning into a series of lesson plans for future use, and to permit the system to be maintained and improved by others.

This has been a MASSIVE amount of experience packed into 5 months of nearly full-time volunteering.  In fact, I have found  ZERO examples of anyone else pursuing such an immersive approach.  (I'm certain such folks exist, but they don't seem to post online.)

I'm still drawing many lessons from this, ever more as I discuss things with teachers and senior staff.  But two items do rise to the top:

1. Subject matter expertise MATTERS!
2. Teaching strategies MATTER!

Effectiveness in BOTH of these is based upon a combination of education and experience.

In particular, I've found my stories from industry are almost always the first such stories the students have EVER heard.  The professionals they know best, that is, those they see getting paid to use a college degree, are primarily teachers, and to a lesser extend law enforcement and emergency personnel.  Even kids with professional parents often don't know what their parents ""really"" do!

The #2 job category most students interact with are retail workers such as sales people, order takers and cashiers.  That can only give them a very limited and non-representational perspective, greatly hindering their ability to meaningfully consider other career paths.

We simply MUST get experienced professionals into STEM classrooms, if only to give students access to folks who have made their living in disciplines other than teaching.  This adds one thing that folks with only subject degrees or minors lack: Industry experience.

But this need NOT be a one-way street from industry to the classroom!  There is nothing that prevents teachers with relevant degrees from getting some industry experience of their own to bring back to the classroom, starting with industrial work during summers or perhaps during a sabbatical year.

Another thing I've learned from interviewing teachers is just how common it is for them to feel their education degrees did little to prepare them for the realities of the classroom and the profession of teaching.  Deeper discussions reveal that they themselves experienced what many of their students experienced: Disconnection from the purpose and/or the content of their education classes.

So, I also feel it is VITAL for all folks desiring to become teachers to put in substantial classroom time as a tutor and assistant, to help out but not be burdened with lesson planning and presentation, or even administrivia.  To be able to observe and learn from both students and teachers, with plenty of time to think about it.  I think volunteering is a great way to start, with pay reserved until they can fill specific jobs.

Bottom line, the referenced article is 100% correct, despite its too-narrow focus.  But it goes both ways, and applies to the art and science of teaching as well as to mastery and application of the subject areas.

Certainly in STEM.  But we take this implicitly in other subject areas: Who would accept a French teacher who couldn't speak French and had never spent serious time in a French-speaking area?  Who would accept a music teacher who couldn't play?

Yet we have science teachers who have never worked in a lab.  Journalism teachers who have never filed a story.  The list goes on.

We need to bring the wider professional world into the classroom.  And we need to get teachers out into that world then return."
highschoolteachers,"I’d like to think I don’t put biases into my grading, but I’ve taught high school science, so not much room for interpretation there. Take physics for instance, what I’ve taught the most.

Is the equation used right?

Is the number right?

Are the units right?

Did the student accurately apply a given law to a written scenario?"
highschoolteachers,"I think I get what you're saying but IME, as both a middle and high school teacher, and this could be changing with time (I'm in high school now and have been for a few years now), there's way less bullying drama from *middle school* boys. 

High school boys do as you say nowadays (at least in my setting where violence is rare and swiftly handled and there are smart, suburban, socially savvy kids who can find ways to bully without consequences) almost at the same rates as my girls, I find. But in middle school, the boys are usually a bit behind that stage whereas many of the girls are starting to be there. This may be changing, but people sharing their experiences aren't necessarily wrong. It also heavily depends on the setting. In settings with high machismo and violent cultures, you won't see much of this kind of male bullying because there will be plenty of the old fashioned kind. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; My college GPA was a 3.4, will this hinder me? I am currently teaching at a public high school.

I don't think that will be an issue.  If I recall, in my program you had to have a minimum 3.0 GPA.  When I was younger, I didn't take academics as seriously as I do now, so my cumulative undergraduate GPA was only 3.25 and I was admitted without issue.  

WGU is more geared towards admitting working professionals into their graduate-level programs than most universities are.  If you apply, you'll be assigned an enrollment counselor and complete an intake interview.  During that time, they're more interested in your credentials, future plans, and professional experience as an educator than what you did as an undergraduate/pre-teaching.  

You will be required to submit a copy of your state teaching credential, any prior professional/subject score reports, transcripts, and any program specific documentation to show proof of your certification/employment status as a teacher.

Also, forgot to add, since you mentioned about finances.  They have numerous scholarships available for teachers, too, which is great.  They range from $500-$2,000, so if you apply and are awarded one that will take a chunk out of your potential debt.  Last time I spoke with my academic advisor (program mentor), I believe she said that the next upcoming scholarship application deadline is June 30th.

They do have a policy that you have to apply at least a month in advance of the term you want to begin.  The enrollment and admission folks are extremely polite and timely about getting things together.  Financial aid on the other hand, will take awhile.  They work at a glacial pace."
highschoolteachers,"Wonderful.  Thanks so much!  I have heard good things about Western Governor's University and this sounds like something I would definitely be interested in.

My college GPA was a 3.4, will this hinder me?  I am currently teaching at a public high school."
highschoolteachers,"It’s a bizarre thing, the age gap. I’m 26, so I’m considerably older than most of my students, but not a huge gap. It sometimes gets weird with pretty female students of mine. 

(Maybe because I was a total nerd when I was in high school, and never really got the attention of the ladies). Lol. "
highschoolteachers,"Wow, sounds like you took over my old job.  Isolated room at an alternative high school for at-risk youth, many with severe behavioral issues and violent tendencies.  Position had excessive turn over due to the disrespect, violence, kids coming in high, and sometimes with weapons.

School administration kept telling me I'd get a phone in my classroom, for more than two years while I worked there.  They kept giving me a shitty walkie talkie that didn't work on my end (same issue with charge and reception) many times, or when I did call they wouldn't respond from their end.  Kids knew there was no means of communication, so some assumed it was the wild, wild west and anything goes.  Thankfully, only had a couple minor fights and a few kids threaten me in that span of time.  After the last school year ended, I was offered a position elsewhere, resigned, and never looked back."
highschoolteachers,"Woohoo! Enjoy your new school. 

I also got hire.  I'm moving from 7th grade in a high end private school to a massive high school. I'm excited for the change. "
highschoolteachers,"I was in your exact boat last year. I did all practicums and student teaching in high school, ended up being hired for middle school.

8th graders aren't too terribly different from 9th graders.

Be prepared to get tough on classroom management, as middle school kids need a structured environment.

As for what you should do over the summer, I'd say read up on your state standards for your grade level (or Common Core if your state does that), start brainstorming activities, but really relax until July."
highschoolteachers,"I'm sorry so many of you are seeing these awful behaviors. Our students have been very chill this week, thank goodness. Today is our last day, and it's been a great year. 

I'm so glad I left middle school and went to our alternative high school. I'm also glad I didn't listen to all the negative comments I heard about the school from people who'd never taught here. We have 300 kids, and the classes are small, around 20 students each. It's amazing what a difference it makes. "
highschoolteachers,"In other words: your degrees are in the language arts and you teach language arts.  Turns out that you, a person with a degree in the *specific* thing you teach do a good job. You would appear to be an example that supports the study.

FWIW: According to the abstract of the paper, the study only involved *math* specifically. The extension to other topics is speculation. (My guess is they'd definitely be right for STEM, particularly path high school level. But the study didn't look at data for all topics.)

The paper itself is behind a paywall.  "
highschoolteachers,"I've seen a math teacher teaching cross canceling but couldn't explain why you are allowed to cross cancel. 

Taking advanced calculus wouldn't help her with that.  I'm not suggesting that teachers don't need advanced classes in their field. 

I was originally going to pharmacy and took a bunch of science but graduated with a b.a and ma in history.  I'm going back to get my chem license.  I already have taken general chem and organic... I've taught and tutored chemistry for 10 years.  Will taking physical chemistry help me teach high school level chemistry... I doubt it... maybe... idk."
highschoolteachers,"You could take my approach and just not have social media. I've gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and can't say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you weren't friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, lets companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that's trickling out, now).

So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is ""I don't have it, here's why,"" because you not only answer the question in a way they can't wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

I might give out my email address, if they're seniors, but that's it. "
highschoolteachers,"You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. They kids behave that way at times, and I just remind myself that life is going to really suck for them after high school-and it's due to THEIR decisions, not mine."
highschoolteachers,"My (Canadian) school district does a ""red gun"" drill in all our high schools once a year. The cops come and basically run through their own training with one cop acting as an active shooter with a gun (it's literally a red gun, they went all out naming it).  Thankfully they don't go as far as OP described and have people pretending to be victims, but they do scream and shout and try to break into rooms/pound on doors.  Students are always in school when it happens, and one year they just happened to have the ""shooter"" in the room across from mine.  It was quite realistic the way the cops treated the whole thing and the ""shooter"" was yelling back until they finally finished it and tackled him down.  It's very very unnerving to do when you've got students with you.  No matter how much we warn them what may occur there's always a couple that end up freaked out.  

In the past I don't remember there ever being a letter home, however this year an email was definitely sent out to all parents telling them the date, exact time it would start and a pretty clear description of what it would involve.  
"
highschoolteachers,"I wish I could upvote this a million times. I keep running into people who can't pass their math praxis but just know that they are going to be GREAT secondary math teachers. I'm sorry to sound elitist, but if you're having trouble passing the high school level entry test, you probably shouldn't be a high school math teacher. Maybe consider a different level, at the very least."
highschoolteachers,"Just today.

Two kids destroying my class. One of said kids straight up says ""It's the last week, I can get in trouble and no one will care. No one can talk to my football coach, my mom's too busy, let's have some fun."" This is a sophomore in high school. 

Basically screwed up my entire class. Repeatedly doing crap to distract everyone. I kick the two out; the class runs smoothly and discussion is actually happening (even though it's almost the end of school)!

Kids come running back in, screaming at top of lungs. Kick them out again. Finally, one asks me to grade something for her--something she did in 3 days after having time to do it for a whole quarter. Grade was a low, low, low F. Kid is convinced ""I'm out to get her"" and ""playing favorites,"" and her grade is only low because I'm mean or something. 

I'm so over it. She copied and pasted 5 things from the internet and wrote 2 sentences on a quarter-long project. I love these kids, but some days they sure make it freaking difficult to want to help them. "
highschoolteachers,What’s funny is I teach high school and my mom teaches elementary. She says she has no idea how I deal with those hormone riddled monsters and I say I have no idea how she deals with ankle biters
highschoolteachers,I teach sophomores and juniors.  I went on a field trip with my middle school daughter. It.was.interesting.   And made me realize how much I like teaching high school. 
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, teachers can have a very deep impact. I had a teacher in high school who helped me through some difficult and some silly problems by just listening and caring. It's always appreciated what you do. Thanks for being an awesome teacher!"
highschoolteachers,"“Uh Ms. Nerdylady86.....why are there teeth marks in this glue stick?”

There was definitely a bite taken out of the purple glue. 

I teach high school."
highschoolteachers,"Not backwards, but you will not be as good at your content area as someone who specializes in it.  I minored in Ed and absolutely have weak areas there because of it, fortunately for me at the university level classroom management is t as rough because the students who don't want to be there just don't show up. I'm awful at convincing students who don't care to be there to actually engage with the content outside the class though, one of the reasons I decided not to teach high school."
highschoolteachers,"I think they are OK up to elementary school.  

Beyond that, yeah time to specialize or the smart kids can exceed the teacher's expertise.

Example: My daughter's high school chemistry teacher just has the education degree.  When my daughter entered her class it was her third year teaching chemistry after spending the previous 9 years teaching Spanish - of which she is also not a native speaker.  

I don't see how you can switch around like that.  I have an engineering degree heavy in chemistry and it was pretty clear to both me and my daughter that the teacher didn't have any depth beyond the text book/canned lesson plans.  Not very inspiring."
highschoolteachers,"In NJ to teach middle school you need 18 credits in the content area now, to teach High school you need 30.  So, a minor for the middle school and a major for the high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I agree! The students I taught my first year will be moving up to the high school, so this is really the first time I'll be saying ""goodbye"" instead of ""see you later."" It's definitely bittersweet."
highschoolteachers,"Someone from The Murican state of Illinois here. I'm currently double majoring. At least in Illinois, if you are doing high school or above, you need a content major, (math, history, english, biology, etc..) and another major with secondary education. If you do elementary school you just need an elementary education major. Some states might do this differently. Cheers!"
highschoolteachers,For my province you need a degree in your teaching subject as well as a teaching degree to teach high school.
highschoolteachers,"What’s the split between a major and a minor (we don’t really do those here)?

The closest we have is joint honours for teaching. That’s about 75% subject and 25% teaching - they basically just miss out the final year thesis which is pretty far beyond anything you’ll do in class. 

Our primary (elementary) teachers have a degree in education which focuses more on broad pedagogy because they need to be a jack of all trades.

However, our secondary (middle/high school) teachers *have* to have a degree in their subject. I’m a physics teacher and I’m not allowed to teach maths beyond a certain level because I’m not qualified."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah some form of collateral would probably work, or maybe say ""give it back or lose a point on this assignment""? Wouldn't apply to 3rd grade but maybe like high school"
highschoolteachers,"FYI wore a pretty skirt suit as per recommendations here. Looked and felt great. 

MUCH more dressy than 75% of elementary teachers and 99% of high school teachers though!"
highschoolteachers,"I only read to the point where you destroyed his drawing.



I was an excellent student. All A’s, never in trouble. Teacher helper. I do not have a violent bone in my body. 

I am also an artist. 

If someone had taken a drawing of mine and destroyed it in front of me when I was in elementary or high school, I can probably guarantee you that I would have screamed at the top of my lungs and lashed out physically. 

Art is deeply personal."
highschoolteachers,A high school student asked me if my balls were the same size. I told her that was inappropriate. So she apologized and asked me if my testicles were the same size.
highschoolteachers,"I was made to teach middle school. Those three years were the WORST for me as a kid, and I love helping then develop a sense of self and emerge happy and excited for high school. "
highschoolteachers,"Anyone have experience or advice to share withs someone (me) considering a career change towards teaching? I am in my mid-20's and currently work in non-profit administration. I work with nice people for an organization that does good work, but the day-to-day is just plain dull, and I feel like I need something more engaging. I've worked with kids on a shorter-term basis (summer programs, sports coaching) and enjoyed it. Would probably be more interested in middle and high school teaching - I studied Political Science and Spanish in college, so those areas of study (including social studies in general since Political science is pretty specific) would be likely topic areas.

What things should I be considering? Questions I can ask myself or things I can do to determine if teaching might be a good fit? Both from a practical perspective, or more philosophical things. I am a bit wary of a wholesale career change with limited prior teaching experience, but am starting to seriously consider it."
highschoolteachers,"Because it's not something that I can control, and whining about it wasn't going to change that. The students all knew this was from the administration. They've also had the luxury of two days outside literally just hanging out and having fun in my class. They should be grateful that they had that opportunity and deal with it, but instead they had to whine and moan and pout. These students are about to be juniors in high school. I understand their disappointment, but the fact that they came to class determined that they were going outside that day (never mind what *I* had planned), and then sulked because they couldn't get their way? Eh. I think it was a bit much. "
highschoolteachers,"If I had my druthers, I'd take all of my classes outside. But our principal has asked that we do not for these last few days unless it is directly related to our curriculum. The class in question has been out twice this semester, the only class to get that treat. And it wasn't to work. We went out and just walked the track and some of them played ball. Literally just getting out of the building and enjoying beautiful weather because I believe that's important. 

There are two reasons the principal wants them inside. One...I think some classes that have gone out recently got into mischief. Kids sneaking off to vape, kids getting in fights. Two...another local high school in our district had a student with a loaded gun on campus last week. With the Texas shooting still fresh, safety is legitimately becoming a concern. This time last year we had to go into lockdown over a threat, and I think something may be brewing again. We've been asked to be on our toes and very alert. 

So it's understandable. Regrettable, but understandable. "
highschoolteachers,"There is nothing toxic or institutional about the culture of my classroom or my school. This is the same school that I graduated from many years ago. These are the children of the people I went to school with. This is a small, friendly, rural school. 

This isn't something new. When I was in high school, I'm sure *we* were crazy by this time of year too. In fact, I know we were. Not because the school or teachers were driving us crazy, but because we were teenagers in the spring ready for summer vacation. 

Society needs to stop making endless excuses for children and blaming everything and everyone else for their behavior. As I said before, no one is *blaming* the students. It's just how it is. 

Interestingly, what prompted my post was that I *did* go off-script and try to teach a more engaging and thought-provoking lesson. Some of them just weren't interested. They no longer want to be engaged. They don't want to participate or even appear to care at this point. Students who are normally very upbeat and enthusiastic were whining and/or indifferent. Again, not *blaming* them, just recognizing it as a sign that summer vacation is approaching and needed. "
highschoolteachers,"I experienced something similar in high school: A classmate and I both took the same summer course at a community college.  The advising office told me that if I got a B or better, they'd consider allowing me to go up to the next higher math class.  I got an A, but in the end they still didn't let me take the class I wanted.  My classmate got a C-, but he was allowed to skip a level.

Based on that I would say that the evaluations for college-prep tracks need to be less arbitrary."
highschoolteachers,"It may depend on the state that you are in. A teacher whom taught at the last high school that I attended (he was never my teacher), was recently arrested for an alleged relationship with at least one high school student, who attends a school in a neighboring school district. He allegedly met this student on a dating website. This was in Texas, where teachers who pursue relationships with K-12 students are charged with a felony."
highschoolteachers,"I love Elementary even though they do drive me crazy at times. Bigger kids scare me, they’re so much sassier.  I also remember how poorly we treated some of our teachers in high school :/"
highschoolteachers,"I am in rural North Coast, and the high school plus middles schools are at record enrollment. We had to hire a new teacher to accommodate more students. "
highschoolteachers,"Middle is a funny kind of beast. We’ll get the goofball nonsense and fun-seeking of the little kids, the deep-and-serious life stuff and the self-exploration of the high school kids, and a brand of new-hormone-fueled hyperdrama and “I-really-love-this-but-I-have-to-pretend-to-hate-it-to-look-cool” that’s all our own. 

And I wouldn’t trade it for any other grade level. "
highschoolteachers,"THIS! Thank you for all you do! You are the foundation for the kids I work with in elementary school! I don’t think people understand how many steps that seem so small but are SO important - a lot is lost after I work with sped m/s. There is not a systematic and consistent middle school or high school system in CA anyway.
There needs to be a way to continue the system of building functional and social skills so these students can be productive adults. "
highschoolteachers,"A lot of our students are the first in their families to graduate high school. Most of our students aren't going on to college, at least not immediately. All of our students flunked out of traditional schools for a variety of reasons, including pregnancy, abuse, homelessness, learning disabilities, being ELLs, etc. Some of our students are 20 years old and just finishing before they age out. 

I'm fine with the hooting and hollering. We teachers do it too, especially for kids who've overcome ridiculous circumstances to get that diploma. "
highschoolteachers,"Reacting only to the comments, I teach high school because there's no fucking way I could teach elementary or junior high."
highschoolteachers,"It’s not insane. I teach high school, and we are regularly drilled that “legally, our first responsibility is the supervision of students.” If something happened in those 2-5 minutes, the teacher would be liable. There are even court cases of a teacher being physically present but texting on his cell phone when a freak accident occurred. He was found negligent. I’m not being preaching, but to CYA, I’d be careful about leaving students unattended in this day and age."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, but the devil brokered the deal, and after five years, I spent an entirely unexpected one year stint in second grade. Whenever I saw my former colleagues that year, they gave me that look that Samuel L gives Bruce Willis when he first meets him in Die Hard...and I looked like Dr. Emmet Brown right after he fell off the toilet in 1955."
highschoolteachers,"This is when you take the time to TEACH about diversity, which also includes disabilities. As a physically disabled woman who was an IEP student from the time I was seven and in a wheelchair in elementary school, kids asked why I got to go up the elevator to the second floor of the school and no one else did. \(It was a locked one that was never used except for 2 kids who happened to be in wheelchairs: myself and another boy who was years older than me.\) So for years I was the only person who used the elevator in an entire elementary school. I was also able to wear sandals, because I am unable to wear actual shoes. In addition, I was able to miss as many days of school as needed, due to my many different medical problems. Turn in assignments late \(this RARELY happened\). If I told the teacher I needed to leave, I was able to leave and head to the nurse at any time and they had to call my mom if I asked and she would come get me. \(I was really good at reading my body and knowing when I needed to be home. I also could go to the office at any time during recess or lunch to call my mom just to talk to her \(due to all the anxiety all of my medical issues from birth on had caused me to have. If I was able to talk to her at lunch, it was easier for me to stay at school.\) The calling her at lunch just to talk stopped inn 5th grade. My medical conditions are all invisible to the naked eye. When looking at me I look like a completely healthy 26 year old and then I looked like a completely healthy 6\+ child. My whole life teachers, doctors, strangers, guys I have dated and even friends have assumed that I am faking my illnesses from anything from attention to pain medication \(when having to go to the ER\) often without the chance to explain. As a young child people thought I wanted attention or didn't really know what I was talking about. As a teenager and young adult people thought I stole my handicap placard and am a drug seeker.

Despite missing more days of school than I attended, every semester, up until the second semester of freshman year I got a 4.0 GPA and never missed an assignment. I never got in trouble for behavioral issues, and rarely used my ""late assignment"" accommodation even when I was in the hospital. After the first semester of Freshman year I did independent study and graduated from high school a year and a half early with a perfect 5.0 \(weighted\) 4.0 \(unweighted\) GPA and got multiple scholarship offers.

Through my education before college although I encountered many people whole didn't believe in me I got very lucky with a certain handful of people who did: my teachers. I will always be grateful and forever blessed for every single one of my 6 elementary school teachers \(I had the same 4th and 5th grade teacher, my favorite actually\). They taught me to love school even though I was terrified to be away from my mother. I always loved learning and they all taught me that I could find people that wouldn't make me feel different. They made me believe that I actually couldn't do things everyone else could do.. I couldn't go run around at recess but I could learn to do things in a different way and that is just as good. They didn't make me feel like they judged me based on my  accommodations \(even if they did, they didn't make me FEEL like they did\) they made me feel like every other kid, and that is all I wanted.

First I went to a college that was amazing with accommodations. I did a semester there but it was to far from home. I got really bad health wise and I was only 16. I couldn't even go to the doctor alone. So I transferred to a different school.

I had to drop out of college because when I became epileptic in my 20s during my junior year I lost a lot of my cognitive ability and the head of the office for students with disabilities already \(before I was epileptic\) already was extremely unhelpful. She often compared me to other disabled students, saying stuff along the lines of ""xxxx gets headaches and she does xxxx, so you can too."" I fought like hell to get the accommodations I needed to no avail. I had never needed them for my academics, just for physical needs, not for extra testing time, etc. Now I did, I had the diagnosis, I had the doctors notes, but I now had a director that didn't believe it me. So I had to leave.

\(After leaving I ended up with a 2 year memory gap and having to relearn most things, couldn't hold a conversation, and my brain will never work the same but I am much much better so I probably would have had to leave anyway, but I lost my scholarship because I was gone for too long with both things together.\)

YES, STUDENTS AND PARENTS RIG THE SYSTEM. THEY ALWAYS WILL. But the way I see it, I would rather multiple students GET accommodations that they DON'T need, than ONE student NOT get accommodations that they DO need.

So sorry for the long post but this hits so close to my heart. For what to say when one child asks why another kid is doing something. I guess it would depend on whether the class knows about the students IEP and disability. Every year at the beginning of the school year I would do a presentation on my main disability: RSD/CRPS. It helped a lot. I wasn't shrouded in mystery. I never had teasing or picking on me. There were stares and stuff but once I answered questions, like I did with the presentation, all that stopped. Maybe an idea to spread for any handicap kids in your classes. Other kids started doing it at my school and it was actually really cool to see us be more knowledgeable and open about disabilities."
highschoolteachers,"I coach my daughter’s hockey team. She’s now at high school age, but when she was younger it was clear. I couldn’t teach anything under high school. Even the middle school boys drove me crazy. "
highschoolteachers,"Exactly. I don’t have any of those, but last year at our district’s high school, some teachers were pitching a fit about black mold. The district paid someone to come in and investigate. They found no black mold anywhere, BUT they found tons of smell-good products. They said those are the worst things for people with allergies, asthma, etc. Needless to say, there is new policy in place in my district."
highschoolteachers,"Many schools adopt curriculum from other countries or organizations, e.g. IB or Common Core or GCSE. Often there will be one person or a small team at each school to manage curriculum adoption and implementation. 

That being said, the unit planning and day to day lesson planning is the work of teachers, often at a team level (I work in middle / high school). 

For me, I wouldn't have it any other way. I find lesson planning to be the creative element as my work as a teacher and enjoy it quite a bit."
highschoolteachers,"IB = International Baccalaureate. It was created to provide curriculum consistency for international students. It is inquiry based and concept driven. It’s a compilation of best practice and research from the last 44 years. It uses standard practices within the framework but give the teacher breathing space for creativity and the development of the whole child. If an expat family moves around, an IB World school would offer them this consistency. You may also see PYP, MYP, and IBDP a these are abbreviations of the IB curriculum programs for primary, middle and high school respectively.

To teach it you need a school with IB to hire and train you, or you can pay for the training yourself. It’s kind of the golden ticket of experience for many international schools.

The other popular curriculum is IGCSE which is the British system."
highschoolteachers,"This has happened to me so many times! I teach 4th grade science now and HATED science in high school so much that I took the bare minimum in college. I have learned alongside my students and learned to love it! I still learn WITH my students daily and just constantly keep myself engaged to make sure I can engage them actively! Find a good PLN outside of just your co-workers, participate in twitter chats, and Pinterest it! You’ve got this!"
highschoolteachers,"I'm glad you've had such a positive experience! If it was a high school position I would have accepted it without question, junior high just isnt my jam."
highschoolteachers,"I'm social studies 7-12 certified and was hired for a January start at high school to start my career. GREAT move, the teacher I replaced got a job counseling at another school, best start to my teaching career I could have hoped for. Would have had to sub daily to make ends meet without it."
highschoolteachers,"What you don't like dealing with that shit? I worked at a local high school in Shanghai for a few years. Well there are definitely some cool features, there were some absolute stressors as well."
highschoolteachers,"Wow I almost feel like I wrote this post except I’m in my second year teaching! I teach high school, though. 

I’m so glad I’m not the only teacher who actually reads books and looks up strategies online. In my experience, very few teachers consult outside resources and just rely on what feels right for them. Early on, I fully believe that’s irresponsible. So thank you for restoring my faith lol. 

I currently feel the EXACT same way and feel the EXACT same confusion you mention in this post. The only thing that makes me lean one way or the other is that the first days of school was written in - was it the late 90s or the early 2000s? Whenever it was written- I was in elementary school. So it’s possible that the kids we are seeing now may respond to different strategies. And since SCM is MUCH more recent (2019), if I had to pick one, I would use the strategies Harry Wong mentions and then anything contradictory in SCM I would change to match SCM. 

I could be wrong, though. Haha! Bookmarking this thread for future reference 👌🏼"
highschoolteachers,"I'm an engineer on his path toward teaching, and a couple years ago I was volunteering at a school that lost two teachers in two months (November and December) for the same reason:  Each was pregnant, had complications, and was placed on mandatory bed-rest.

The school had excellent subs, but none wanted to fill-in once the new semester started.  It was a small ""continuation"" high school, so other teachers weren't rushing to transfer in.  A frantic recruitment effort did yield two acceptable candidates, but only one accepted the offer.  Fortunately, that teacher's mother had recently retired from teaching, and decided to join her son on the new job!

I had never seen two teachers get better support at all levels.  It didn't hurt that the teachers on bed-rest were always willing to pitch in (which was desperately needed, as each was the only one teaching their subjects).  Even their students went the extra mile to help them come up to speed (quite a surprise).

I'm certain this was a special and unique situation, but starting mid-year may have benefits that outweigh the negatives.

(BTW: Both teachers on bed-rest had happy and healthy kids.)"
highschoolteachers,I’m starting in my own classroom in August and Ive been wondering/stressing about what to do if  you don’t know every exact detail about a topic you’re going over (high school history). So what do y’all do in this situation??
highschoolteachers,"I had zero experience. I only ever worked as a high school English teacher. My interview was to teach a 20-minute lesson using tech and teaching a skill, then a normal interview. I'm a ""credentialed trainer"" which means my supervisor trained me to teach all of the courses in an application (like lab, labor and delivery, cardiology, etc...they all have cutesy names...Beaker, Stork, Cupid...) according to lesson plans that were created, with Epic's plans as the spine, for our system. 

I don't work directly for Epic so I can't speak much to their process. I know someone who worked for them in Madison straight out of college in some kind of testing capacity, and the pay was as much or more than I made as a teacher (in a poorly paid state) - I think she found it a little grueling and boring but she got her foot in the door in a year or two, and now works as a trainer like I am. I know my system pulls teacher applications with basically equal optimism as a person with software or clinical experience, so I'd say start applying directly to Epic or a specific system if you want to try! I do really miss the kids, but man, being treated like a professional in so many other ways is wonderful."
highschoolteachers,I’m very interested in this. Currently a high school math teacher in my 5th year and not sure this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. How much more additional schooling did you have to do before you were hired?
highschoolteachers,"My high school had a male teacher of almost 30 years transition to female extremely quickly and hardly anyone batted an eye. It was at a small, red, and rural school and I’m being honest when I say literally no one cared. Yeah, people were shocked because in about two weeks Mr went to Mrs, but nothing happened to her, the school, or the students.

This was almost ten years ago and things are even more progressive now. You do you and all should go as planned!"
highschoolteachers,"I left teaching this year after teaching high school algebra for 3 years. I'm currently working for a company that's training me to be a commercial real estate appraiser. It's a great job, especially for anyone analytically minded, but open positions are few and far between. I found it by doing a general full time position job search on indeed. I wasn't aware of the position until I saw the posting. Look around, you never know what you'll find!

Before I got my current job I was primarily applying for project coordinator positions. If you're good at managing people and organization, it's another job worth checking out."
highschoolteachers,"Is he still in high school? If so, then yes that's a problem. She is still an authority figure over him if so.

But if he's out of high school and is 18... mind your own business, dude."
highschoolteachers,Ugh that's my fear. I was hired on to a high school with my 5-9 math license. Which I guess technically I was teaching mostly 9th grade math. That November I got my 6-12 endorsement.
highschoolteachers,"I think there are some instances where it is acceptable. For instance, my friends and I are in our early 20s and we play fantasy football with a few of our former high school teachers and have for years.

Some of my friends have coached sports with those teachers (two friends are varsity head coaches now) and a few of us, myself included, are educators ourselves now.

Obviously this all has a lot more going on that your situation OP. And while not everything in the world is fine and dandy, I would say there is a real possibility it's nothing malicious."
highschoolteachers,"Once the kid has left high school and is a legal adult all interactions are fair game. That includes romantic ones. 

Remember many early career teachers are actually pretty young. Often easily inside the cultural normal dating range for school leavers. I even know a few teachers that ended up marrying former students. 

Alternatively they could be just hanging out. Or doing mentoring. Or just catching up on the old days. Either way it's fine."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah! I was a high school teacher and now work at a large healthcare company training staff on the electronic medical records software we use, Epic. I had no clinical background whatsoever. It depends on the company, but my department weighs experience in education equally with clinical experience. I guess they figure you can teach people what they need to know to explain how to, say, order medication, but it's a lot tougher to teach someone to be an effective instructor."
highschoolteachers,Go for it. I started mid year teaching high school with no experience whatsoever. At least you have already been working in a school. You’ll be fine.
highschoolteachers,"It is sooo hard. And the pressure is real for sure. I’m second year and I didn’t get renewed after my first year so I’m starting all over again. I was devastated not getting renewed and can’t go through that again. I like my new job and new school and feel way more supported than I was last year. But yeah the feeling of being judged rings true for me too. I teach high school so I am judged by the students too! Not that they have any say in my performance reviews, but they are the ones I want to impress the most because they are the reason I’m there. Meanwhile admin is who decides if I stay or go. Until a teacher is tenured there is no job security and it’s so stressful. I’ve stopped relaying any issues I have with my colleagues because even though I know they can related I still feel like I don’t want them to know everything! I only bring up situations if it’s about a certain student and they might know them to offer if the kid is a jerk or is it me and/or what worked for them. Anyway, I feel ya. It’s hard. But don’t doubt yourself, you’re passionate and doing the best you can do. It’s all we can do. Good luck."
highschoolteachers,"1/ Districts: there are something like 850 districts in Illinois. It is not at all unusual for a mid size town to have 2-3 elementary districts (EC/K-8) and then feed into 1-2 high school districts and then there's often a separate special ed district on top of that. One school districts are also not unusual. (""I should get an administrator and superintendent's license"" may have just gone off in your head). The closer in to Chicago the more prevalent this nonsense is. That said, Chicago city (CPS) is one big district.

2/ Job portals are k12jobspot and IASBO. There are also job postings on Regional Boards of Ed websites.  There is no consistency to how jobs are posted so make your search broad.  I would also bookmark and regularly check the districts you are interested in as postings don't always make it to jobspot etc in a timely manner. 

3/ Each district is required to complete ""school report cards"" which have achievement, demographic, teacher, etc info on them.  Use these to get familiar with the districts you are applying to.

4/ Job searches can start as early as winter break. There are districts with full time postings up now for next year.  But, there are also plenty of districts that hire into the summer or into the school year.  Like everywhere else, the more competitive/desirable higher achieving districts tend to have their shit in one bag and get hiring done early.  

5/ ESL will help a great deal as will a SPED endorsement.  ELA is going to be pretty competitive. 

6/ Don't limit yourself to Cook and DuPage especially as a new teacher. Lake, McHenry, Will, and Kendall county will all have districts where you can get your foot in the door and - who knows - maybe even stay."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a HS bio teacher at a charter in CA, and I see you've mentioned that's where you are now.  CA is desperate for teachers, so they won't be worried in the slightest about alternative certifications.  I will forewarn you that there isn't as much of a market for bio teachers as for the other sciences; if you added chemistry and physics or earth science to your portfolio, your hire-ability will increase.  If you want to stay in CA, your best bet to find work would be away from the coasts and look in the Central Valley (cost of living is also cheaper in the Central Valley).

Your age might be a concern for people, especially if you were to teach high school. You have to have CLEAR boundaries between you and your students, even though you'd all be close to the same age.  You might consider teaching middle school science instead, where the age gap is greater.  More so than older teachers you would REALLY need to make sure that you're professional at work at all times and not trying to be ""friends"" with students.  Your students might also have a hard time drawing that distinction, especially if they find out how old you are or find you on social media.

If you do decide to go into a teacher prep/credentialing program and teach at the same time, just be aware that it is going to consume a LOT of your free time. The first year of teaching is hard anyway, but having to do work for your own classes on top of teaching makes it extra stressful. I'm not trying to discourage you, but give you a better picture of what to expect.  It is do-able, but it isn't easy.

TL;DR: most schools aren't concerned with alternative certification programs, you'd find work in the Central Valley (if you stay in CA), school/life balance is shot especially the first couple of years, draw HARD boundaries between yourself and students if you teach HS, and consider teaching chem/physics/Earth science too."
highschoolteachers,"Even though you would be teaching one content area like English, you could teach different grade levels so you’d have planning for each of those classes. Classroom management is different and tactics and strategies are more complex since you might have 18 year olds who hate school and are disruptive but want to be treated like young adults even though they don’t seem to know what that looks like. I love teaching high school though in terms of content and the kids. Young adults is more my style than unruly middle schoolers. Not saying high schoolers aren’t unruly buts they aren’t bouncing off the walls either. You have to have a passion for your content area because that will carry over in your teaching, which for apathetic learners means a lot. I’d you’re lucky and after a few years of teaching you might get to teach advanced classes, and that’s kind of the sweet spot, so it seems. I teach gen ed and I’m okay with that. I can deal better with apathy than grade grubbing."
highschoolteachers,"I went from teaching high school biology to being a librarian, and it's the best decision I have ever made. Depending on your district, the requirements are different, but in my district all that was needed was a bachelor's degree in anything. The benefits and retirement are exactly the same as teachers, and the pay is about the same as teachers. The stress is basically non-existent and you never have to take home work."
highschoolteachers,Dont forget that even though you'll likely spend less time planning (if you are teaching one subject at high school level) you will spend more time grading because you'll have more students. Plus high school teachers often get tasked with extra responsibilities like club advisors or supervising dances or sporting events.
highschoolteachers,"It all depends on the students/school/class/administration. Success in one  high school class is about finding ways to connect  disengaged learners with basic curriculum and another class will be about discussing higher level world issues with advanced students. It’s a broad spectrum. 
I think both things are fun, so I like teaching high school :)"
highschoolteachers,"Here's a novel approach: change the laws and don't require that kids come to school. Make it so that only the students who give a shit come to school--and make it so that parents are fined if their children disrupt the classroom. Forcing children who don't care to attend school make everybody's life difficult, and it also artificially inflates the value of a high school diploma (given that such kids are pushed through the system)."
highschoolteachers,"California high school biology teacher here. 

I finished with a B.A. in Health, Exercise, and Sports Science in dec 2017 and was teaching biology at the high school I had graduated from (teaching in the same classroom i, myself, took biology in, pretty trippy right?) by Aug. 2018. 

I enrolled in a teacher prep program in the summer of ‘18 (school districts either have their own  prep program or an outside program makes an agreement with the school districts) and applied for my current job early August of that year. 

I believe if you don’t get into any of the prep programs you are still able to teach with a PiP or a STP (temporary credentials) but you won’t be at the top of the applicant pool considering you aren’t credentialed or even applying to be credentialed in the future (at least this is my understanding, I could be wrong). There is also a pretty short time limit for those (couple of years). 

Do some googling- are you considering moving literally to any state in the country? Bold move, lol. Impressive, if you are."
highschoolteachers,"You don't need to do five years of university (college is something different here) to be a teacher in the UK. 

I started studying for my BSc when I was 18. Teacher training is a one year process after you get your degree. Your degree is 3 years. 

So... September of age 18 I started my degree. May of age 20 I finished my degree (this is a normal pace). September of age 21 I started teacher training. May of age 21 I finished teacher training. June of age 21 I started teaching high school. I'm a summer baby so I turned 22 during the summer. 

None of this was accelerated. This is a normal pace here."
highschoolteachers,"The thing I hate most about teaching is that I feel like I'm babysitting more than teaching, high school. 

I think the only other options would be to teach adults somehow. Tour guide would be fun, but as others have said, it would get boring and the pay would suck, unless you're retired. I've thought about corporate training, I used to work in industry in the chemical field, and there are people that train employees for a variety of functions. Other than something like this, teaching at the college level would involve less babysitting."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I show my students gratitude for everything. I say thank you when they do the bare minimum of things, etc. I also have a good rapport with many of them and will often thank myself in a fake student voice.
""Thanks mr""
""Oh you're welcome""
""You're the best teacher ever""
""That's sweet of you"""
highschoolteachers,"Not a teacher here, but a high school student. I don’t necessarily think students will care about your race, but in case you haven’t noticed, high school students and kids in general are ruthless assholes. I’m ashamed to be grouped in with the other inconsiderate high schoolers, but there is no doubt you will be mocked if you reveal your trans past. It’s almost certainly going to be a different experience with high schoolers rather than elementary and middle schoolers. 

On the other hand, I definitely wouldn’t be able to tell that you came from a trans background, and neither would pretty much anyone else.

Despite all that, I hope the best for you."
highschoolteachers,3-6.   I'll deal with high school.  But I'd rather die that teach 7 or 8
highschoolteachers,"I agree with this comment. I student-taught in a high school last year and came in after winter break. No need to do a get to know you activity, just an introduction and start to build relationships with the students. High school students don’t want to do these and won’t take it seriously."
highschoolteachers,"Hey, sorry for the late response but my sister has a high school teacher vlog ""Blissful Biologist"""
highschoolteachers,"It generally comes down to the complexity of ideas and the quality of the diction and syntax that improves as students progress through high school. We spend 9th and 10th grade focusing on the ""rules"" of writing--i.e. mastering the standard five-paragraph essay structure, supporting claims with evidence, writing a clear thesis statement. 11th and 12th are more college preparatory in focus; once students have demonstrated mastery of the basics, they are ready to move on to college level writing, which often breaks those rules. You will have students at all grade levels who write beautifully and are able to break the rules before the rest of your students can. This can't necessarily be taught; those kids develop style and voice over many years of avid reading and writing. All you can do is encourage it, celebrate it, and get them to push boundaries.

I think giving kids ""numbers"" of things to include in a thesis or in an essay is arbitrary. I give guidelines, like sentence starters etc., especially with lower level writers but emphasize that it's not the only way to accomplish the task. The most important thing is, in argumentative writing, do they make a claim? Is it arguable? And do they back it up with clear evidence?

It will become more intuitive to you the more essays you read. You'll start to notice patterns in student writing. I don't know what level of kids you are teaching, but you may want to look up the writing rubrics for AP English classes. I actually like the new one they've released this year and think it's usable in standard level classes too."
highschoolteachers,"3rd-6th. At the lowest end of that you get so much sweetness and love and at the upper they are starting to have a decent sense of humour. And across that age range they are capable of doing interesting work and showing some independence and collaborative skills.

That said, I've only taught those ages and high school. I'd quite likely love k-2 if I spent a year with them."
highschoolteachers,"I’ve had this same dream, and I’m not teaching at the same high school I went to. In my dream I am teaching classes, but during my prep period I have to take a math class from one of my coworkers because it turned out I didn’t have enough credits to graduate high school."
highschoolteachers,"These seem like anxiety dreams, but keep in mind, they don't have to mean you're anxious about teaching. The brain is weird and it seems that our jobs and school experiences are two fertile grounds for finding past anxiety, and you merged both in your life. I will have the typical ""forgot to make copies"" or ""have to go back to high school because I didn't pass a class"" dreams, but just to mix it up, I also have the hockey-related ""it's my shift and I can't find my skates"" ones too. But, and this was the long way to get there, if you take steps in your life to reduce general anxiety, you'll have less of these types of dreams. And if you are anxious about teaching (which would be perfectly normal), the same thing still applies, although making sure you're feeling prepared for the upcoming week may be one of those steps."
highschoolteachers,I’ve definitely got some ideas for personal finance and investing that we will do. I remember my high school Econ being super boring with mostly vocab and I want to bring more life to it if possible.
highschoolteachers,"(ex) student here.
In elementary school, I had a really kind teacher (she was (is, but at different school now) teaching math and physics), her and I somehow became friends, it happened at first sight. We saw each other and I felt a ”click”, you know when something gets to its place. We always teased each other in her classes (I was 12, and where I live you graduate from elementary at 14-15 yrs old, we don't have middle schools, you go to elementary school for 8 years and 4-5 years at high school). So anyway it lasted for a good 3 years, we often talked about basically nothings, just some random stuffs in periods, and we lived really close to each other, so sometimes we went to school together (we went to school with the same bus and we often met there by accident).
And after graduation, I went back to my elementary school almost every Friday, or when I had time for that, just to meet her. At that time we had never spoken to each other ”outside” of school. And again we didn't speak about important subjects just some random things, like about my high school, education, favorite tv shows/books, etc, you know just some small talk kinda stuffs. And at that time we often went home together (I mean, we went with the same bus). Before I graduated from high school she changed school, so after that, we didn’t meet each other, except for once, and that was just a random thing, she had business at the same location as I had, so again by accident, and that went for a couple of years.
We started talking and meeting again for almost 3 years now. But this time we use Facebook messenger for talking and we are planning our meetings now. I was very shy and awkward (mostly awkward) like every teenager, but now we can talk about anything, it's now way more than just a teacher-student friendship, she is really a close friend of mine now.
FYI I am a woman too, and I had an average childhood, I was just a little bit weirder compared to my classmates (and family members). And somehow she saw the real me, when nobody bothered and listened to my every little nonsense, she was really patient with me, she was (is) a really good teacher despite the fact that I hate math and I never was good at it.

Sorry for the TL;DR and my horrible English (I am Hungarian)."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for this post.


I'm a gay high school teacher, out to a few colleagues but not students. Some of them have asked me if I'm gay and I usually deflect, but I'm hoping to be more open in the future.

Your post gives me hope. :)"
highschoolteachers,"You need a new job outside your same high school! :-) 

I have a similar dream about a class in college I showed up for maybe three times. I keep waiting for my college to rescind my degree. I've been out of that college for more than 20 years! I write it off as guilt for never going to that class."
highschoolteachers,Third year teaching high school. Taught college before
highschoolteachers,"My mom and I are both teachers, but she teaches elementary and I teach high school science. 

She currently teaches second grade at a title 1 school where she frequently encounters students with horrendous backstories. I’m talking about kids who quite literally have parents that are obvious drug addicts, in jail, or just absent for whatever reason. 

I don’t teach at the kind of school she does, and I felt the same way you do. Hell, I might still feel that way. But, one day I asked her why she puts herself through all of that difficulty (because she deals with some nightmare behaviors I won’t ever experience), and she gave me some perspective. 

In life, generally we’re more proud of the things that took us a lot of time and effort to do. The harder we work at something, the more accomplished we feel when we succeed. 

Working with a difficult population is kind of like that. You put in a lot of hard work and deal with a lot of problems, but there’s also the possibility that you might change one of your student’s lives for the better, forever. Imagine being able to impact children in that kind of way. For some people, the work is worth it for the reward!

She also said that with each kind of population (title 1 vs. affluent), there are different problems and different positives. For title 1’s, there’s typically less parental involvement (i don’t want to generalize but that’s been my mom’s experience as a teacher for over 30 years). That also means there’s less pushback from families and less helicopter parents reporting you to admin. This alleviates some of the stressors of being a teacher. 

When teaching at more affluent schools, however, there’s generally higher parental involvement. AKA- more helicopter parents questioning your teaching and reporting you to admin, which forces you to do more tedious documentation and causes additional stress that is less likely to occur if you taught at a less affluent school. 

So, I’m not sure what the answer is. I think it depends on you, the population of kids, the people who work at the school, and honest to god luck of the draw. You could work at a school with great kids, but your coworkers and admin are toxic. Or you could work at a school with highly difficult kids, and have an awesome support team. And it just depends!

Just thought I’d provide the unique perspective my mom described to me, I hope maybe it helps give you some clarity!"
highschoolteachers,"I do know one teacher who ended up adopting a former student. The story is a long one, and doesn't really matter, except that she went through all the proper channels- became the child's foster parent, etc. It literally ended up happily ever after, which was nice to see. 

I do have favorite students, and keep in touch with some former students via social media. But I am very strict about such things- I do not connect with them on social media until they have their high school diplomas in hand, and they are at least 18 years old. 

While they're in school, I ask about how things are going a lot. My students frequently come from less than ideal home lives, so a staff person going to a basketball game just to watch them play, for example, means the world to them."
highschoolteachers,"You can have a fulfilling career in private schools, but be prorated to make a lot less money. At least that's how it is around me in the Northeast. And no matter where you teach, at the high school level, you will spend too much time babysitting."
highschoolteachers,"For high schoolers, try to break up the routine with a day (Friday?) each week that is dedicated to a quizzing game, independent study, ask questions say. 

My AP US History teacher did that every other week on Fridays and we all loved her for it. Many kids have so much going on in high school and get burned out. Knowing they have a safe space to ask questions about the course or just catch up with work during the school day without getting “punished” for working on hw in school can really help a lot."
highschoolteachers,"Australian high school perspective. We have been explicitly told we are not to have students on social media until 5 years after they graduate. The only exception to this rule I have ever done is if the student also happens to be a colleagues child. 

I have met for coffee with past students but it is always in a very public place and there has been another person there if possible (e.g. fellow colleague) and I had a lot to do with the family. I still see the mum because her youngest is in prep at my school. 

There are very strict rules with relationships with students. I  feel these are potentially relaxed in small towns/ communities but the big thing is transparency. For example I have driven students home after late night school events but only with the explicit permission of both their parents and my school administrators and only as a last resort (e.g. the kid would be stranded late at night). Even then I have a dash cam in my car and use that as insurance to protect myself. 

What complicates a Miss Hunny type situation is that children in at risk environments like that are more likely to be at risk for grooming etc. More likely for Matilda is that Miss Hunny would have called child protection services and keeps detailed notes on all of the abuse Matilda faces but that was also at the school so who knows. 

There was a great Aussie TV show about a setting scandal and the teacher takes home a kids phone and I was literally screaming at the TV ""what are you doing?"". 

Another factor is who the teacher is. It isn't fair but a young male teacher (or any male teacher I guess) will always be looked at more suspiciously than a middle aged Mum teacher. Not fair but that's how it is."
highschoolteachers,"Even though we love all our students and want to help them be the best they can be, there are boundaries. We are in a professional relationship with our students and the specifics you ask cross all kinds of lines. I teach high school and I wonder and worry about so many of my students but we have resources available to them if they need help beyond what I can do. I care. I listen. And when they tell me they couldn’t do the work because their dad is going to kick them out of the house, then I no longer care about the assignment but I also can’t invite them to my house but I can help connect them to the resources at school that can help them. I see so many movies where these lines are crossed and it’s so frustrating because it’s not ever like that nor should it be."
highschoolteachers,"My high school students usually communicate with me through the remind app. They register with their phone number but when messaging through the app we can't see each other's numbers.
I teach sped and it is hard to keep track of all my kiddos and their needs. They are putting good at messaging me when they need help with oral administration of exams, need homework done, or need to stay for tutoring."
highschoolteachers,"I try to take an interest in their lives,  ""I saw you are in the  school play, that's awesome. ""   ""Good luck at your game today.""  That sort of thing. My students also know they can reach me through my school email and I can get them help if they need.   I can forward emails to our school counselors for example.  But what you're describing is inappropriate for a teacher.  

I teach high school.  My mom teaches 1st grade and some of the parents (ones who volunteer regularly) have her cell number but the students themselves don't."
highschoolteachers,"Only look at the teacher contract in districts that you're interested in if you want an exact number.  But yes, you will probably start around 30-40k depending on where you live.  

I actually live in Michigan and caution you against becoming too optimistic when you look at averages.  Collective bargaining agreements in this state also don't differentiate pay between a high school teacher and an elementary one, although you could get paid extra if you take on extra duties."
highschoolteachers,Go for it. My first teaching position was at an alternative high school at the age of 23. So go for it and best of luck!
highschoolteachers,"Note-taking is a **requirement** if you want to be truly successful in college.

I took sooooooo many notes. Not only in class, but I probably took 3-4 times as many notes outside of class--if not more.

My students would never take that initiative. And I don't think it's because they don't know how. I didn't really ""know how"" to take notes. I learned as I went...it turns out that simple notes just seem to help me. So write down big/key ideas and follow that up with simpler ideas, etc.


In my class I do give guided notes, but not many. As I said...I really only give them if I want to speed up the notes or if there's a lot of drawing or diagramming. Or graphing. The second set of notes in my Physics class is guided because are dealing with graphing of motion--so position, velocity and acceleration vs. time graphs. It's just easier/quicker to give them some note sheets that have those graphs and have spots for them to fill in next to each thing.

Then when we spend the next 2 days doing activities related to motion graphing I tell them ""look at your notes!"". And when we quiz I actually give them a new set of notes on white paper (the original is on blue or yellow paper or whatever). Why? Because I tell them that they need to transcribe or re-write their notes onto the white paper and they can use that during the quiz. If they don't want to use their notes then they don't need to do that.

The colored paper is so that any clever ones can't just use a copier to transfer the notes (if they have access to one which some do at home). It will transfer the color over as well and the white paper will be darker/grayer.

There is a way around that, but I don't think my students are smart enough to know BEFOREHAND so they'll screw up their only copy.


There's something to be said about: taking your own notes. Re-writing notes. And giving more notes. Notes **help**. They guide students to what they need to study. Yes, they are boring, but don't do straight notes for more than 15-20 minutes. If a kid can't deal with 15-20 minutes of notes then deal with that however you need to (at least in high school). Otherwise, have an activity ready to do after the notes.

Hell...I've thought about telling my students ""Now re-write those notes onto another sheet of paper and add drawings/diagrams to help you. You have 10 minutes"" right after doing notes, but I'm not sure how much that'll help."
highschoolteachers,"All of us have kids like that. It’s so sad. It’s usually a combination of learned helplessness, a lack of understanding that **they have to pass this to graduate** and a fear of trying because — if they tried — they might end up finding out they’re not as smart as they think they are. (Nobody believe they are a C student)

You’ve hit it in the head: you either hold their hands or let them fail. I’m in the same boat. I’ve got a handful of kids throughout my day who are failing. Some for good reason, others not so much. In high school, I’m somewhat philosophically opposed to hand-holding. But, for some, it’s what’s needed. You have to decide what you’re going to do"
highschoolteachers,"1. Doesn’t hurt to try. If you have the credential, might as well apply!
2. 23 isn’t too young. I’m in my second year of teaching high school and I turned 23 when the school year started. The age gap is scary, especially if you teach upperclassmen, but consistency, especially with discipline, will get you far in a high school setting."
highschoolteachers,"I started teaching at a public high school at age 23.  The security guards on campus kept trying to bust me for ditching class when I would walk to the office during my prep period- even though I was wearing a suit and had my ID tag on.  

Go for it!"
highschoolteachers,"Go for it! Plenty of teachers right out of college teach high school. I started teaching in a private school HS at 24 (masters) and am at a public school now. Just turned 26 two days ago. Definitely look young but hasn’t caused any problems or difficulties. I get the occasional comment (more from PEERS than anything) about looking young. Kids always try to guess my age but they usually guess 26-28 so that’s fair. I never say if they’re correct or not though lol, unless they say 23 and I say nope that’s not possible (I guess if I was a young college prodigy it is lol). As long as you’re confident (and certified - which you are), there’s absolutely nothing holding you back! Plus you could potentially get similar judgments from parents and colleagues in an elementary school as well - it’s just a fact of life as a young teacher. Just my two cents!"
highschoolteachers,"Taught a single semester of virtual classes in multiple high school science preps in Florida on top of my normal classes.  I found integrating a kanban board solution for project management and student run work tracking to be invaluable.  

I personally used Trello, but your district may have other solutions that are free if you have Enterprise access to MS Office 365.  Had a few colleagues using Microsoft teams for this same process."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the reply. If you don't mind, I have a few questions. I am naturally a very anxious and obsessive person (in therapy to figure this all out) and lately I have been obsessing about my future. I can't enjoy break with all of it on my mind. Is it true that I will have to work a second job while I teach? I think its ridiculous that I will need a second job after paying and grinding for a 4 year degree. Also, how do you scrape together money for classroom supplies? Does it come out of your pocket? Do you receive a stipend? Lastly, I love kids but some of them are straight up rude to me (yes, elementary aged ones) and I get easily offended. How do I avoid being offended by this behavior? Do you have any tips for dealing with this? I worked with some kids this summer and a second grader told me, ""I never liked you"" while a kindergartner told me ""You're annoying."" I know its stupid to be offended by children, but I take these so personally and I'm so sensitive. It really affects my self esteem. Sometimes I think I'm too sensitive to teach :( I was teased a lot throughout middle school and high school, and from there I developed my sensitivity."
highschoolteachers,"She finish all her courses and they refuse to give her a degree? I have never heard of that. These colleges are scams if you have to pay a lot for them. I have heard of them pushing people to sign up for useless degrees and then students can’t find a job to pay back hundreds of thousands in loans. 

If you are wary of them, then look for online programs from a brick and mortar school. I see a lot of all online programs from GSU. https://academics.georgiasouthern.edu/online/

Don’t know the costs but make sure you’re not spending a lot of money on it. See if you can get reimbursed for classes from your job. Don’t worry about the workload of online education classes. Like I said they were easier than my high school classes. It was honestly a joke. The only way you fail is if you don’t do any work and don’t turn in anything on time."
highschoolteachers,"You’re going to want to do an online program if you work full time. It is very hard to do in person when you’re tired from working all day. It is not just going to class, but finding and paying for parking, getting on a bus or walking to the building where it is located, etc. 

I tried to take an on campus class one time and I had to drop it within 2 weeks. It sucked because due to timing (after school when I’m tired), traffic, parking, walking, and generally being super late at night (so they can attract more teachers). From then on I only did online courses.

 Masters in education degrees are kinda fluff to be honest. If you wanted to get a masters in math I would be wary. But most masters in education degrees are just a checkbox to tick. My courses were easier than my high school classes. Basically online education courses follow these same pattern: they assign a reading for the week, then may require you to post about it on a discussion board, or write a paper reflecting on the reading. They may require an essay about a topic, etc. unless you do NO WORK and submit NOTHING then you get at least an A-. 

My recommendation is to find an ALL online program that is the cheapest. If you’re looking for the pay bump it doesn’t matter where you get this degree. Also, since you’re not looking to get 
extra endorsements, it is even better for you. You just need that box ticked off. Lots of people do online universities (WGU, Phoenix, etc). Or if a state school is cheaper (my state school was charging like 3 times what the online universities charged lol), then go to that one."
highschoolteachers,"Same. I tell everyone to go into dentistry or civil engineering. Both easy to do and are in constant need.

I actually find teaching to be relatively easy job to do, but at the high school history level we are stuck to the state testing so it's a common curriculum that just gets boring after a while."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, no. If I could go back, I would’ve stayed on my original path to be a high school history or English teacher rather than elementary. If I could do something non-education related, I’d either be a baker or doing something in accounting or law."
highschoolteachers,"It's a conundrum. We get in trouble for this but if we pack every minute, kids are going to get stressed, and we get in trouble again for that and are told ""build relationships,"" etc. Where is the time anymore if one minute on something non academic can lead to punitive actions for us?

Anyways, to OP: Since you're in high school, I think your teachers would be willing to have a mature conversation with you about it if you approach them privately like before or after class and make a reasoned argument for it. I'm sure several would even tell you exactly what we're saying: we are always under the microscope, even if it doesn't look like it."
highschoolteachers,"I can relate to this some.  I always liked math and found it easy in high school so I knew I wanted to do something related, but no idea what.  

If I were to do it again, with current knowledge, I probably would go in one of 3 directions: accounting, engineering or something tech related.

All the time off is nice, but I just don't enjoy it the way I feel like a teacher should enjoy teaching.  I've actually signed up to do a tour/admissions thing at a university nearby to see what I need to get into the master's program for accounting."
highschoolteachers,"You reminded me of a teacher I met during my years of subbing. She taught a Foreign Language at a Title 1 school where it was a dream to work. At the risk of sounding racist, it was a dream to work there because the school was 80-90% Asian; and, as such, it was a high-performing school where disciplinary issues were few and far between. I subbed many times there, and one time it was during an assembly day for a guest speaker. I was shocked by how quiet and respectful these high schoolers were as an audience, and by how much they engaged and went along with the dumb little activities the speaker had asked them to do.

All that said, that teacher in question was bored. There may have been other problems to contend with, such as admin's BS, but at least the students were not among them. Anyway, after many years there, she left to another district. I had only one email communication with her not long after her departure, and she said that she missed the tranquility of working at her old school because now she had to deal with a lot more disciplinary issues, and now had to spend more time on classroom management than on content, although she did like that there was more variety of interactions and experiences with students."
highschoolteachers,"I have fun doing this stuff with my high schoolers.   No spring chicken anymore at 36, but there's a lack of nerd teachers at my school so I always get a few good reactions when they realize I'm knowledgeable on video games, anime, comics, etc."
highschoolteachers,So I teach high school at two different campuses in my district (freshmen have their own campus and 10-12 in another building) and I start my day at the freshman campus before traveling to the main campus. I had a dream last night where I was teaching at main campus and halfway through a math lesson (I’m a music teacher soooo....) I realized I forgot to go to the freshmen campus entirely but no one had called me or wondered where I was. I was freaking out. I want school to start I guess even though this break has been nice.
highschoolteachers,"The night before last I dreamed that I took a few high school, world geography classes on a field trip to see 2 old 17th century navy ships with a collab teacher that doesn't have much business teaching. I live in the middle of the country, hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean.   


On the trip, the students managed to use a canon to blow one of the ships up. The other ship they managed to untie and I had to swim after it(I have a bit of a phobia about the ocean and waves) then learn how to get the sails down and steer it back to the pier. Other students I caught having sex or vaping in different places. No one would listen, they were disappearing all over the place and I was constantly having to have talks and threaten calls home.  


Finally, near the end of the dream there were shooting noises at one of the nearby warehouses and students were refusing to be silent or wait orderly in a safe area.  


  
I woke up grumpy."
highschoolteachers,"That's part of the problem. Even the company that espouses the benefits of PLC's (which again...has very *sparse* research) says ""Most schools are just doing it wrong and kidding themselves"". But that doesn't stop them taking $600 per head at their conferences and trainings...of course not.

Whatever you were doing sounds stupid. It sounds like your admin. had no clue what the point of PLC's are. You should not have been ""forced"" to meet. You should not have had to meet every single day. You should not have been forced to get a product of any kind that you had to show to them.

My admin seems to be struggling with it as well, but they are supposed to be the ""experts"" as they've gone to trainings. A few teachers from our school (at $600 a head) recently went and basically said ""It's a great idea, but there's **a lot** that needs to happen before we get there"". And part of that is changing the culture of the school--both the students and the teachers.


I also think the issue is ultimately going to be consistency. We recently had an entire subject matter (at a high school) of teachers that essentially left. There was one teacher remaining out of 4. Their team devolved from being on a pedestal to being in shambles. 2 new teachers that had no clue what was going on with PLC's joined and a third teacher joined that is hard-headed and **knows** what works for his students joined.

Part of the hiring at my school has become ""Can they work well in a team?"", but I question whether that is sufficient. What about transfers that we have no choice on? How do you tell from an interview whether someone will work well? How do you get new teachers to *stay* with all of this work that is necessary?

PLC's are nothing new. Even when the term was new...it wasn't new. It was a couple of educational researchers wrapping up old ideas into a new name (which is nothing new in education).

They are going to last because they tick all the boxes that parents and admin want to hear, but there is no way to be truly consistent with them in the long-term at a school. The entire dynamic of a team changes with old members leaving and new members arriving which means everything goes back to square 1. And that's just not going to sit well with veteran teachers who know what works in their classrooms--we all know them and work with them. We also know that some of them are right and some of them are wrong. That's the nature of the beast and PLC's seem to expect that given time...eventually...everyone will be able to reach that ultimate goal of ""perfection"" in the classroom. And that's just ridiculous."
highschoolteachers,"My students are in shock when I tell them I have a 90 minute edm album on iTunes that I made

And that I was a goth kid in high school so I have a soft spot for those students"
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for your service to our country! So I’ve been teaching for 2 years now (last year as a long term sub, this is my first full time role) and I can honestly agree that 9/10 days coming home to feel exhausted but I love the kids I work with (I work with high school kids in Special Education (mild to moderate) near Chicago) and it really is worth it! The only thing I dislike about my job is all the paperwork that is required. I wish I would have been more certain about wanting to teach during my undergrad, instead of thinking about Law School, so I could have started my career earlier! I’m a social studies teacher by trade, but I really enjoy teaching and my current role. I am curious, what made you decide to teach in an elementary school and what advice would you have for a first year teacher to help them be successful?"
highschoolteachers,"This is a tough one because honestly I could go either way. I both like and dislike the job at the same time. However, I’d think I would feel the same way about any job I could have picked. If I could go back, I would probably go about it in a different way. I’d probably pick another area instead of high school or just bite the bullet and go for an MFA"
highschoolteachers,Well if you look at other jobs that require a 4 year degree (or likely a masters) 70k is on the low end for that level of education.  My son who is 22 and a high school graduate (and one semester of college) makes 13 an hour a Goodwill.  He has zero student debt.  I on the other had am making 52k (I'm not complaining)  with 40k in debt.  If my school didn't reimburse for my master's I could have double that.
highschoolteachers,"No. I should have stuck with freelance sign language interpreting or gone into spoken language translation. (I took Spanish and German in high school and ASL and Russian in college, and was always told I should think about that as a career, because languages clearly came easily to me.)"
highschoolteachers,"No

I went into teaching as it was the one career I knew the most about since I come from a family of teachers. Everyday though, I wonder what would have happened if I would have gone into computers. I am old and when I graduatwd, computers where a new thing just happening. I loved coding on the old Apple IIe our school got my senior year of high school but didn't know about any real careers except maybe business. I knew computer programmers where a thing but they where typically males (and I am a female).

Fast-forward to now. I am a school librarian who not only integrates technology into classrooms but I spend 90% of my time on computers...more tech director than book worm sort of stuff. My best friend in high school though went the computer route and has done very well for herself. If only I was brave enough to do the same back then..."
highschoolteachers,"I don't have these during breaks. I have them during the week though. Lesson not planned. Walking into work and my clothes start disappearing. The worst is when I'm teaching a class and kids are being rude/disrespectful and they literally just don't listen to me at all. I even remember shouting in that dream and a kid just laughing.

Nothing like that shit happens in my classroom. If a kid is being rude/disrespectful they \[usually\] get kicked out of the room. Full stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I still have dreams about being in high school and riding the bus. I mean...I haven't been on a school bus for...well over a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I would try to watch what you do with work throughout the day. If something is stressing you about work then address it with yourself. What's the cause? What can you do about it?

And sleep on time. Teachers are notorious for falling out of habit over breaks. You might have to stick to a good routine to avoid the nightmares.

Others have made good suggestions as well. If you can get them (and use them legally because we are on a teacher sub...!) then THC edibles are great. Go very light though if you just want to sleep. A single gummy. Hell...some people have reactions with half a gummy (which makes no sense to me because I can eat 5 and just feel *slightly* out of it). If you can't then maybe try meditation--mindfulness meditation seems to help a lot of people."
highschoolteachers,"I have been teaching for three years; I started off student teaching 7th grade, but moved up to the high school level after completing that. I've had five different preps (subjects taught) at my school, so I've had all grade levels. I am currently teaching on-level Physics as well as AP Physics 1, so I only have juniors and seniors right now.

I'd say the largest behavior problem our teachers face is defiance/cellphone use. However, our admin is generally supportive of actions we take, and students do receive consequences for their actions. (I work in ISS one period a day, so I hear it all...) 

The biggest problem that I'd say I've heard from other teachers is the lack of pay support here. My city is about a 2 hour drive from four major cities in Texas that all have a starting pay that's 8k+ larger than here, without increasing the cost of living by much. We lose a lot of teachers to those larger districts because of that, and because their spouses may not be able to find well-compensated jobs here. We did, however, get a new superintendent a year and a half ago, and he has been very willing to involve the community in decisions that need to be made, and willing to hear the thoughts of people here. I think things are definitely looking up."
highschoolteachers,It doesn't stop once they get to high school. Have a junior who thinks they are going to play in college at a top 10 football team despite not playing on their high school team.
highschoolteachers,"I said I was going to drop out of high school and be on the Disney Channel in 6th grade.   

I never made it to Disney, and I never dropped out."
highschoolteachers,"Do nothing but smile and give a noncommittal answer like ""okay"" or ""let's make it through sixth first.""

In their own way they are testing you. Seeing how you will respond. If you affirm them they might see it as an excuse to do nothing the rest of the year. If you try to convince them to graduate high school then they can perceive that you are trying to deny their agency and they will do nothing out of pure rebellion.

Once you get to know them and them you later in the year then revisit the topic. You will have a much better idea of why they think that way and can better help them."
highschoolteachers,"They're joking. 

Think about what these kids see all day.....they probably spent the last year watching tiktok. there is this culture of putting yourself down, even when you are successful. Its been a thing since I was in high school, back in 2014."
highschoolteachers,Hello neighbor! I'm a junior high teacher in Katy. Only a few of our social studies teachers are coaches. It's common for social studies teachers to be coaches in 6/7th grades because there's no STAAR requirements. May be different for high school. I'd definitely recommend getting certified in more than 1 content area as that will increase your job opportunities.
highschoolteachers,"You didn’t mention peer reviewed articles but you mentioned a lot that can be BS and  can be convincing if you are uneducated. People can read all kinds of things, doesn’t mean they understand it……again I trust immunologists and experts who study this stuff, not a dude who barely passed high school that is  paranoid that big bad chemicals like dihydrogen monoxide is going to kill them. People who think the government is out to get them are paranoid….. that is a mental health disorder, again not the person that is making the most rational decisions."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English in the US. It does get better. First year is hella stressful. First semester is hella stressful. Getting a rhythm, gaining respect, establishing what works and doesn't takes time. But yes, I agree with the other posters. The students really are the best part (excepting the 5 of my 150 every year who are pains in the asses). You do form relationships. You do make a difference. You can make students feel like they matter. You can inspire them (event the pains in the asses)."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school but when I hear a student say this (oftentimes not seriously), I just immediately make it about money.

Your income and the type of jobs you can get goes up a crazy amount just by graduating. Sleep through class, put in as little effort as necessary, do whatever you got to do just to graduate. Then you can start living the life you want with more money to spend on the things you like."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school science teacher and I have never decorated my rooms. To be fair, I didn't have my own room for nine years, but the four years I've had a room, I refuse to decorate. I get away with it by (1) inviting students to decorate it if they want to (they usually don't) and (2) by requesting the funds for decoration be put into my supplies funds.

Edit: so, if you are bad at decorating because it's not something that floats your boat, skip it and let students fill the empty space as the year goes on."
highschoolteachers,"Not all history teachers have to coach, and not all coaches are history teachers.  I teach Physics and AP Calculus and I am a football and wrestling coach.  My head football coach in high school whom I coached under and is now in our state coaching hall of fame also taught math.  Heck, in my high school, the only teachers who haven't at some point been a coach are our Band (though he does run marching band), Choir, Biology, Chemistry, and one of our other Math teachers.

Now, having said that, the supply of teachers in the social sciences is way higher than, say STEM.  So, often, when admin is deciding on who they're going to hire, anything else you can add to the table will tip the scales in your favor."
highschoolteachers,"I have a student who repeatedly tells everyone he doesn’t have to care about school because he’s going to be in the NFL. But he’s never played football, ever. He says “I’ll just play in high school.” What’s worse is his mom 100% thinks the same way."
highschoolteachers,"100% 

I usually get at least one cold during the school year but last year, nothing. I teach high school. We were in person all year - part hybrid, then mostly in. Masks on."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly my high school is not very normal, but yeah idk! My history teacher in rural Texas was a coach, but he was one of two history teachers in the whole school, so it's a small sample size!"
highschoolteachers,Really? I went to a high school in CFISD and literally all my history teachers were coaches lol must be a district thing
highschoolteachers,"I’m sorry. It’s really frustrating to be in negative environment, especially with kids at that age. 

Just remember they aren’t necessarily planning this. They’re going to grow and mature a lot of the next few years. Planning and sixth graders... it just doesn’t go together. They might drop out in the future. There are a lot of factors in and out of school that would lead to that. I don’t know you’re kids, so I can’t say. 

My advice:

1. Kids will keep saying this if you have an emotional reaction. If you calmly say, “no” or “I don’t think so,” they’re more likely to stop. You probably want to have honest conversations about this, but you also need to stop them from flippantly saying it. 

2. Work to make your classroom a non-frustrating place. Be a reason they don’t hate school. Have a positive classroom. This should really be number 1. 

3. As an ELA teacher, make sure everyone can access the reading at their level. I don’t have data right now, but reading level is a predictor of sticking in school. So a good ELA class really helps. 

4. Down the line, when you have less emotional response, do a lesson on the better outcomes for people who graduate high school, college, etc. 

Lastly, remember that it’s your first year. You cannot do everything for these kids. It’s good to care, but don’t become a martyr."
highschoolteachers,I work at a high school in Houston and most of the history teachers are just that: teachers. A majority of the coaches at my school are actually math teachers believe it or not!
highschoolteachers,"I taught 6-8 for years and I heard that a lot. It was always incredibly disheartening. That said, it's been long enough that those kids are 11-12 or graduated. As it turns out, very few dropped out.

Middle school is rough. Nothing works right in your body or your brain. By high school, the ride smooths out for most kids. Not all, but most. That fatalism will fade away."
highschoolteachers,"For myself I have all of what you listed but I also have a toothbrush/toothpaste - I drink my coffee on the drive to school and I like to start my day with a clean mouth. I also have hand lotion, chapstick, deodorant, and hair ties. For students I have bandaids, an extra charger, and cheap ear buds (they can keep). It’s high school, they never ask me for anything more than bandaids and charger and for be only offered the ear buds once. Otherwise they’ll get stuff from the nurse or counselor’s office."
highschoolteachers,"I think this is more of a stereotype than a real thing. I teach in Texas and only 2 of the history teachers on my campus coach. There are actually teachers in every content that are also coaches. 

As for programs for coaching, I don't think you have to have any special certification or extra training to be a coach. I mean obviously you have to know and learn the sport you're coaching, but that's about it, and typically you aren't alone in it. There are multiple coaches for each sport due to the different levels and teams (A, B, C, or Varsity and JV) and from what I know they all semi work together and help each other. 

I teach at a junior high for context. High school might be different to a degree, but I do know people who teach history at high schools and don't coach as well."
highschoolteachers,"Not in Texas but in another football crazy state(South Carolina-not as crazy as Texas).

I think the “history teacher as a coach”  thing is way overblown.

The social studies department at my high school has at least 15 or 16 teachers.  

3 of us coach football.  1 coaches girls tennis.  And that’s it.  

My previous school had 8 members of SS department.  I coached football.  1 guy coached football and baseball.

You should be fine, it’s not like there’s a surplus of teachers out there.  

I really don’t think you have much to worry about.  You may need to be willing to help with something like yearbook, student government, Model UN, etc."
highschoolteachers,My high school teachers always used aliases on social media- things far off their real first names. They kept their accounts super private and didn’t accept any students (until after grad). Another good way to “hide”
highschoolteachers,"Similar to what others have said, at the secondary level stuff like this can seem infantile, especially to upper classmen (don’t get me started on teachers who call high schoolers “kiddos”). And truly what is really going to be different about your rules than most others. I teach a lab heavy science class so I focus a lot on safety and such but I place my classroom policies in my syllabus and try to keep it at a list of 10, and that usually includes procedures and rules. But I generally I sum it up with being respectful and being safe. Throughout the year I constantly tell them guys you are are 16,17,18, biggest rule with this lab is don’t be dumb and they generally seem to appreciate that tone. Same with bathroom policies, I follow the general only 2 out at a time, but other than that yeah you can go. If I have to tell my 18 year old seniors how to use the bathroom then they have bigger issues. Not to say that works for every student at every school but with the vast majority of my students they can handle it. Again you mileage may vary based on your population."
highschoolteachers,"It’s not really selfishness as much as just being ignorant 

Most of these fuckers have a 9th grade education, barely passed high school and are just dumb as shit"
highschoolteachers,Absolutely….. but they barely passed high school and they know more than immunologists.
highschoolteachers,Texas teacher here. On Monday we will have over 800 teachers crammed into a high school auditorium for a cluster convocation. Not looking forward to it.
highschoolteachers,"In addition to what everyone else has said here, don’t have any social media. I teach high school and don’t have anything. My cousin’s wife is a teacher and has a fb under a weird combo of her initials and her middle name (like Bt Anne, when her name is actually Bethany) and is only friends with family and a few close nonfriend teachers."
highschoolteachers,Every positive breakthrough case at a high school will send one hundred kids home to isolate and test.
highschoolteachers,"I had an old co-worker from my part time college job who always made Facebook posts that were anti-vax and anti-mask. He was one of the most outspoken critics in my life and it infuriated me to read the nonsense he spewed, but I left it alone since I knew I wasn't going to change his mind.

Last week his wife posted on his account that he passed away due to complications from COVID. I want to take his case, frame his anti-mask quotes, then frame his wife's post along with all the condolences and use it as an example.

He was in his early 40s and now his high school aged daughter will finish growing up without a father because he bought into the disinformation. I don't feel sad about him dying at all; I feel like he openly invited it. But I feel horrible seeing it impact his family and community when there was a very simple solution for him to prevent this all for free.

People need to understand it's not just that they're willing to roll the dice with their own lives, but they leave a huge gaping hole that affects everyone around them if something happens. You're not just risking your life."
highschoolteachers,"Hey! I started my career the same way as you did (hired as an ELD teacher after applying  for an English position) but at the high school level. I'm not entirely sure about how ELD looks in middle school but it looks like we teach in the same state so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I've been teaching ELs for 5 years and I'll never do anything else. They're the best kids in the world."
highschoolteachers,"I do teach high school.  My apologies, I had not even thought about it from the elementary perspective - it could definitely be a problem in that context."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly I had a teacher back in high school who was “old” I honestly don’t know her age but she was a great teacher. She had students help her grade, she would put on documentaries, and just kind of went with the flow. Didn’t seem too strenuous on her"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a bit confused and I apologize if I'm misunderstanding what you're saying. 

On the one hand you are saying that you have no problem getting a breakthrough infection if it means not having to wear a mask. On the other hand you seem to be complaining about being around lots of unmasked people. You're also at a high school - how many of those teenagers do you think are actually going to be vaccinated? 

None of the vaccines are 100% effective and hardly anyone on my campus is wearing masks (I also know some who have refused to get it). I already know some people who have gotten sick with the delta variant after getting vaccinated and it still knocked them out for almost two weeks. The goal should be NOT to get sick at all (at least as much as humanly possible) since it's not just about you as an individual. You can still spread it to others, take it home, etc. I'm just really having a hard time understanding people's logic in discontinuing the wearing of masks because they have been vaccinated when none of them are 100% effective. This isn't meant as a personal attack or anything, I'm just trying to understand the logic."
highschoolteachers,"Teaching Physics/Astronomy in high school, this is also my experience.  

For a while, I made up a short contract that I would have copies of on hand for students who refused to do any work, wherein it's stated that I tried to engage and help (and had sections to check indicating which methods were attempted, including an ""other"" spot w/ room to explain), and that the student is still refusing based on their own desires and that this would forfeit their right to get extra/make-up help from me on those topics.  

For the most part, this worked well, and many students were happy to sign this contract day in and day out (btw, it had provisions about disturbing class so I could still follow basic/required procedures for such situations according to our school's policies).  This was a thing mentioned in the syllabus that parents and students signed at the start of the year, which was an effective CYA as far as my use of it.  Parents were sometimes surprised about this when they ""found out"" later in the year, but even then they generally understood and took it up with their student - I found that this method did a good job of relieving the duty to do an impossible thing (""making"" an apathetic kid do anything) while also making it clear that I did indeed do my best to help and engage (my class was damned fun, but those stories will be saved for later).

The one issue that came up with this was when admin decided they didn't like the clause stating that I wouldn't go back to help remediate them over stuff they didn't do.  I removed it and was allowed to continue with these, but I did have to adjust how I handled students coming in (often the day before/of a test or the week before finals) begging for help with ""everything"".  I'd just look at their signed forms and figure out what content they were missing from those dates and very slowly work through it.  It was often impossible for them to get the amount of help they needed in time, so it was still a somewhat effective encouragement to be more engaged in the future, though plenty would still just bail when they realized I wasn't just going to give them a busy-work assignment that would make up all the *points* they had missed.  That just ain't gonna fly."
highschoolteachers,"A ton of what I run into in my high school English class is that students think that their complaints will make the work go away, or that they can lessen their load by being loudly against doing it. The simple solution I have found is to merely state, “This is not a negotiation. Your assignment is your assignment. It’s due on this day. I will grade what you turn in on day. Every complaint after this will cost 5 points.”

Usually stops them, but you’ve got to hold firm."
highschoolteachers,"I would assume it’s because the girl is performing at a higher level than the boy, and the school admin doesn’t have any concerns about her ability to be successful in high school.   On the other hand, I would guess the boy has a much lower reading and math level and is not yet reading for the high school contend."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;30min activity if it’s hands on and presented right. then we do a 10-20min break—all day was like that. they did that since kindergarten, so i was following that same system and it worked well.

I'm just saying, I've had autistic, ADHD, and behavior kids that could not handle 30 minutes of continuous work even with the ""fun"" stuff, and I'm in a gen ed setting so I was surprised by your wording in the original post.

For some, I literally started with the goal of 2 minutes of pro-social, on-task, appropriate behavior and then they moved to a short 1-2 minute break. I teach kinder in a gen ed setting so I understand this may seem extreme if you're dealing with older kids, but my husband is a high school SPED teacher and has definitely had kids that need to start with a 5-on, 5-off system. Not too different than some of my kinders. For kids with autsim or ADHD I'm surprised they didn't have frequent breaks as part of their IEPs since 30 minutes can be pushing it even for gen ed kids depending on the activity and intensity.

30 mins of work is fine for some activities, but it's school. Not everything gets to be hands on and fun lol. Sometimes there's work to be done. My lower-functioning kids could maybe handle a 30 minute block of fun and hands-on stuff, but when it came to actual work would struggle. I also don't have the time, resources, or energy to plan every single lesson to be engaging specifically for the one kid (or small handful). Sometimes we gotta sit at our desks and do math. This is a normal expectation in society so it was my goal to get my kids to a point where they could do this to some extent. Not everything in life is gonna be fast-paced, hands-on, engaging, and fun. My job is to build functional skills so they can sit at a desk for periods of time without distracting their peers, throwing a desk, ripping up their work, and actually learn.

Are you trained, certified, etc in SPED? Like do you have a SPED degree?

As a resource teacher I love your systems and I would do pretty much the same thing. I'm in first grade next year and my ELA block will be a lot like what you described--centers with one-on-one or small group being a station, and a station for free choice or brain break. 100% that's the way to go.

As an adult, I still need things to be highly visual. I don't remember anything, legitimately I have a horrible memory to the point that it impairs my life so I need instructions, important dates, etc to be written out somewhere. Lists are helpful if they are short and short-term. I also need to see a calendar to get an idea of how long or close something is in time. I need concrete. Watching movies with subtitles is a necessity for me so I can follow what's going on. Routines are incredibly important for me. 

I also need clear, simple instructions for new or complex tasks and repeating them back helps. I do this with my adhd kids to make sure they understand and will remember multi-step instructions. Daily routines and expectations need to be visual, repeated every single day, modeled, referenced, and practiced. Reminders and accountability are important too."
highschoolteachers,"It will get better! I promise! I usually fill the first couple of days with information as well as fun games, surveys, personality tests, and color pages/activities for my high school kiddos. 

The first couple of days are always chaos with attendance policies, schedule changes, new initiatives, new protocols, students who just want to talk to their friends instead of learning, and the works. You're 100% doing amazing, and it will level out once the new wears off and they get into the routine and schedule."
highschoolteachers,"Yup. What’s worse it’s almost always a bored housewife or Horny husband who finds this shit. I had a teacher in high school, amazing history teacher, who lost his job because he did gay porn back in college (late 80s/early 90s)….who the hell has the patience to search that far back?! The scandal happened when I was a senior back in 2009. So…It sucks. He was beloved but the district decided he was “dangerous for the children”"
highschoolteachers,"Maybe it's because I'm in high school, but I've certainly had kids try to look me up as well as other teachers on social media. Definitely scrub that asap. 

Everyone already gave great recommendations on how to bury your name in searches with more boring professional information. Just keep testing out your name to see how your results would shows up until everything you want is sufficiently buried."
highschoolteachers,To be fair the plus side of her doing elementary is that high school students are pro stalkers
highschoolteachers,"I also do the boy girl boy girl seating chart and it’s super effective! Especially with 9th grade boys, who are bonkers but the girls are mature and so over the boy antics. It’s pretty funny to watch the dynamics. Although, I teach gen Ed ELA, high school, so my classes are pretty dude heavy, so the boy girl ratio is off. All the girls are taking advanced classes. But it still works for sure."
highschoolteachers,"Never underestimate a stay at home mom with no kids during the school year. This will buy about 4 months of 'safety' if that. I coach high school, parents I haven't even met know where I went to high school, the fraternity I was president of, some even know I had an underage drinking ticket in 2012."
highschoolteachers,"I have been arrested when I was ~20 and still became a teacher...... teaching at a high school inside of a youth prison nonetheless. 

I genuinely believe you will be fine. Just make a basic online presence with social media and you will be ok. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I would hope not. The educational field is all about growth and opening doors for young people. You did nothing illegal. I’d hate to imagine that our actions be held against us for the rest of our lives.  I took on a student teacher years ago that had an arrest record from when she was 18 for marijuana possession. I told her during her interview (we interview student teachers) that I saw her arrest through a simple Google search. I am not judging and I don’t care (side note, I’ve never done lot and have no interest, the smell is terrible).  I’m not going to be a gatekeeper because an 18 year old made a bad choice. I teach high school, I constantly see bad choices being made. I’m giving her the opportunity to enter a career that she might have a passion for. But I did tell her to be prepared to answer for that action in future interviews. 

No one in any profession should be should be held to unreasonable, fabricated standards. I wish you good luck."
highschoolteachers,I remember a long time ago before I became a teacher. My wife taught high school at the time. We were at a Christmas show at church and sitting in the balcony. Right in front of a bunch of teenagers. They were goofing around and being loud during the show. My wife turns around and gives it to them hard. I was so shocked. Both that she did it and that they all listened and got real quiet!!  That was the day I knew I was married to a bad ass!!
highschoolteachers,"It is possible. I am high school and work at a low socio-economic school. I get there by 7.30 and leave around 3.30-4.00. I do not take much work home and typically only do 1-2 hours beyond this a week.

I prepare during school holidays are try to have planning done for the first 6 weeks by the time school time starts.

I book my meetings with firm end times. I like morning meetings because the end time is the bell to start class - can't run late if I have to be in class

I understand that close enough is good enough - my room is undecorated, I don't always have the best lessons, I am not the world's best teacher - that is okay. Sometimes I end the class with 15 mins of YouTube. Sometimes I go out and get take away lunch from across the road. Sometimes I don't get my assignments marked within 2 weeks. I often answer emails in class time, as well as record things on our management system.

I spend my money on things I want to for students, not supplies. I do pizza parties and give away chocolates, and that's fine. The school pays for pens and, if not, not my problem.

Family comes first."
highschoolteachers,"I despise comic sans. I work in a high school though, and my mom who works as a secretary in a pre-school made a good point that it is common and the most similar font to how those tiny kids are learning to write, particularly because most fonts put that little curve on top of the lowercase letter ""a"". And I haven't thought enough about fonts to have a good argument against that."
highschoolteachers,"My high school had a couple incidents not too different that this last year; we had protocols in place for it. Teachers reached out, then guidance staff, then resource officers that did home visits. These culminated in guidance-led mediations involving the students, students' families, and whoever the students were staying with.

*Politely* ask your school district/superintendent what the protocols were supposed to be and if they can help facilitate some mediation. They're busy folks, so--for best service--try to keep your message as brief as possible."
highschoolteachers,"Second-year (second-career) teacher ... the art classrooms smell the same as they did in the '80s when I was in high school. So do the band hall, the theater, and the library. Aaaaah, nostalgia! :)"
highschoolteachers,"Last year was my first year teaching. But before that I did sub and did student teach so I was in schools for the past couple years. I usually got a really sore throat a couple weeks in. I usually got bronchitis in the winter (This goes back to me even in my high school and college times). I remember November 2019 while student teaching, I got hit with a sinus infection from Hell. So much so, I remember thinking in March 2020 when the Covid conversation was getting serious that I might have already gotten it (certainly wasn't the case).

This past year, the only thing I got was Covid. I had some congestion and a sore throat. Looking back, I was a little more tired than usual also. I felt overall fine. I only got tested because Covid times and my Father had a pretty bad cough and he had brief less than 15 minute contact with someone Covid positive. But yup. I got Covid but that's it in terms of sickness. Unless allergies count. They hit me harder than ever to the point I wore my mask outdoors for a while."
highschoolteachers,To be honest I felt I didn’t get sick at all. However I did get Covid from my coworker. As soon as I stopped wearing my mask and got vaccinated I instantly got a cold. Also I’m a technology teacher. Last year I taught middle and high school. Now I’m at a new school teaching auto shop and architecture. I honestly can’t wait for school to start to teach these classes.
highschoolteachers,"I was able to hang out in the teacher's lounge without issue when I taught middle school and substituted high school.... but I avoid it like the plague now that I teach elementary school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being a male teacher in an elementary school (5th grade) will quickly show you that sexism is NOT a one-way street. Far from it."
highschoolteachers,"My advice: Multi-day group projects with an oral presentation. Whenever I feel really overwhelmed (high school,  6 different preps), I stagger these projects throughout my courses. 

Design a group project (PowerPoint, poster, etc) where they will independently research a topic and present to the class. While they are researching and preparing, you can prep, grade, etc. The added benefit of an oral presentation is that you grade it while they are presenting so you won't get further behind grading. If they work in groups, there is also less grading (grade one project instead of four). Collaborating, researching, and presenting are valuable higher-order thinking and soft skills anyway so it can be win-win.

Don't resign. The first year is always tough. Eventually you will build enough reusable lessons that it won't be as bad. Breaking your contract can have consequences that impact future job prospects. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Was not sick one single day. Still have not been sick since Jan 2020 (not covid). Thanks, masks!

ETA high school teacher"
highschoolteachers,Ugh yes I’m a high school special Ed para and my teacher has the walls COVERED in posters with inspirational quotes written in cursive. Our students can barely read..much less read cursive! It bugs me so bad
highschoolteachers,If the mom is really that upset over that comment she is the one with the problem. Trust me when I say your comment was no where close to being over the top.  I’ve heard coaches tell high school players to literally “stop fucking up the drill.”
highschoolteachers,"This is my first year teaching and I definitely approached it as decorating for me. I’m high school STEM, so I found some posters off Etsy I liked, frames from Amazon, and hung them in my room. Found an airplant decoration I liked. Need to do my bulletin board still, but I found cheap bulletin board boarder from Target. It makes me happy &amp; with my run down/non AC room I wanted joy for myself."
highschoolteachers,"You’ve articulated something that’s stood out to me for a while! Thanks!

My room is basically void of decorations (high school). I’ll have important things on part of the walls like the fire drill route map. I have some of the highest performers kids in the school. It’s not because I don’t have decorations…but like the OP said most people do it for themselves or to look good…it doesn’t really help the kids."
highschoolteachers,"I disagree. I didn’t really decorate my room at first. At the end of each year I give my kids a detailed feedback survey. Overwhelmingly students said they wished that I (and other teachers) decorated more. “Why was high school so sterile?” Moreover, as I taught more, I realized a lot of my kids came from crap homes with crap things. Scented lotions to use? Stellar. Nice smells? Comforting! A clean, warm space? Safe. I wish I could paint my walls. I largely have artwork and photos from me in high school through present — kids LOVE that. A few quotes. Then a space for kids awesome stuff. They like to make art to hang in my room like hanging something on the fridge at home. 

I try to make my room look and feel cozy and kids always comment on it."
highschoolteachers,"I feel this post in my soul.

I'm taking over a high school classroom that was abandoned by the former teacher. I'm talking overhead projector transparencies, VHS tapes (in a room with an HD tv and SmartBoard), and tacky ass posters and decorations that look like they're built for elementary students.

One of the posters in this high school English classroom says, ""Sometimes I use words I don't understand so I can sound more PHOTOSYNTHESIS."""
highschoolteachers,You can’t reveal problems in teaching. Lots of pretending at work bc there is a lack of trust and community (perhaps mostly high school).  If you share an idea that is contrary..you’re negative..if you don’t tKe in more tasks..you’re disengaged..etc. just my 2 cents😝
highschoolteachers,"I’m a retired teacher who substitutes K-12. The range of classroom decor is broad. Elementary teachers often have so much decor that it’s distractingly busy. There’s way too much stuff! 

At the other end of the spectrum are high school teachers who might have 1 thing up on the wall. I saw one classroom where the only thing on the bare bulletin board was a notice of some sort."
highschoolteachers,"I had a dad tell me he played in high school for a good coach and needs to be at practice to see that we are teaching the right things.

He called the AD to bitch. The AD, who I wish was still our AD, told me he recited my playing and coaching resume and told the guy there were no plans to request I change my policy.

I have three girls in my school now and all play something. Only one plays basketball. The only team-related communication I have with their coaches is about what we can do to help with snacks or meals on road trips. I want to be the very last person their coaches worry about."
highschoolteachers,"I was once in a plane with what was clearly a varsity team of high schoolers acting like complete fools. No idea where their chaperones were at.

So I noticed that they were from our local governor's school, and I knew a former colleague of mine, with a reputation for being very strict worked there. I dropped his name and told them he'd be hearing about this if they didn't stop. I don't think I heard a peep from the entire team for the rest of the ride."
highschoolteachers,Anyone already have school open?  What’s happening with COVID specifically high school teachers?
highschoolteachers,"Eh, I disagree - you're being too hard on yourself.  For every student who didn't like your minimalist approach, there's another who would complain about another teacher's cutesy or garish approach.  Minimalism is an aesthetic like any other.

Some students will complain about anything, and any time you're teaching a group of people, pleasing some will disappoint others.  In my department, I have a teacher (who I deeply respect and would never want to criticize) who's basically the opposite of my teaching style: I'm the AP Calc/Physics guy who believes in students shooting for the moon, getting excited about exploration, achievement, puzzles and thought, and who will openly tell them I respect their time too much to spend it on anything that doesn't further the study of the amazing world they're in.  That clicks, strongly, with some students: I have kids who visit me from college every year and brighten my day telling me how much they remember and like my classes.

But others hate it; they see it as nerdy, intimidating, lame and no fun.  My coworker didn't graduate high school initially and had to get her GED, and she identifies strongly with kids who struggle.  With her, math is a tough pill they have to swallow, and she's all about being their friend to help them through the struggle.  Her classes are marked by frequent breaks, coloring and wordsearch assignments, and walls filled with every oddity you could imagine.  She's amazingly effective with the students that are hardest for me to reach, but I've often had to have words with some of the students who look up to me the most when their complaints about the 'fluff' in her classes border on downright mean.

&amp;#x200B;

If you beat yourself up over anything except shorting them on their education, you'll drive yourself mad trying to please everyone.  Students complain more loudly than they praise; I'm sure there are students who appreciated the minimalist environment that helped them focus and be calm."
highschoolteachers,"My only experiences in SPED was as a sub, and I had a bookcase pushed on me by an autistic child. And then I was in a SLC in a high school classroom and was not knowledgeable on the depth of the kiddos disabilities or temperaments, so I took each day I was in there as a massive learning curve. That just took a lot out of me. 

My experiences have always been challenging bc I never knew any of the students. I was a stranger, and that never went well with some students who depend on stability."
highschoolteachers,"Well, hell yeah I’m decorating for me lol. If I have to be in a classroom for eight hours for five days a week, you better believe I’m going to make it feel less like a prison cell and more like an extension of my home and what matters to me.

I think there’s a balance you walk when decorating a classroom, though. Research shows that wall to wall busy-ness is distracting for students and harms learning more than helps it. Moreover, what you put up should be either strategic or let students in on the type of person you are. On the other hand, too bare of a room, and students generally are less likely to want to be there. Believe it or not, students do talk to other teachers, other staff, and their families about their teachers and their classroom spaces. Last year, during PTCs, I had several comments from families telling me that their students like how “beachy” and “soothing” my room is and that it’s one of their favorite spaces in the school. Kids notice when you put a lot of thought into things; they also notice your emotional state and that can affect their emotional state (because quite frankly, I’d be sad if I couldn’t so much as put up a single poster in my room). I find especially middle school students pay so much attention to classroom spaces.  My high school students didn’t care as much.

I highly recommend putting up student work samples (ungraded, of course). Many students love to see their work on display. If you do put up academic posters, I think you should set a goal to then incorporate that poster into your instruction. Classroom management related posters work the same way; I have my lab rules posted on a wall because we refer back to them before every lab session. The only place in the room that has my own personal stuff is right along my teacher’s desk area, and I’ve never gotten complaints about my macrame wall hanging or Animal Crossing pictures lol. The AC stuff is actually a talking point for students with me. Everything else is decorated in neutral colors with a scattering of plants.

Also, some kids definitely do like stools lol. I have lab stools and then regular seats, and some of my kids always want to sit in the stools as opposed to the regular seats."
highschoolteachers,"Young man... when they force you to pray

I said, young man, when amen they will say

Then just go man, go straight today

And call the A. C. L. U. (bomp! bomp! bomp! bomp!)

It's fun to call the A - C - L - U.

It's fun to call the A - C - L - U.

They take cases for free! They have fancy degrees, at the

A - C - L - U....

Seriously, when I was in high school we said 'amen' after the 'moment of silent meditation'. An agnostic parent happened to be in the building one morning and heard us, and noped out of there directly to the ACLU. It only took a letter from the ACLU for my (pretty conservative) public school to figure out some other way to get on with their mornings. The letter didn't even name the parent, if I recall correctly -- there's no reason they would need to name you unless they actually filed suit against your school.

(I apologize if you are not a young man.)"
highschoolteachers,I decorate my room and teach high school chemistry. Many of my colleagues have a room that looks like a prison cell.
highschoolteachers,"Nothing in the quote you're provided implies that anybody is giving anybody a gun, or even ""giving"" training.  My Florida Concealed Carry License costs me $102, my Wisconsin Concealed Carry License costs me $22, and my Minnesota Concealed Carry License costs me $75.  This is not including mandatory classes and training I need to keep my licenses current.  Compare this to the fact that I just paid $125 to get my Lifetime Teaching license, paid $125 to get my initial educator's license, $130 each for three subject Praxis II tests, $150 for the Praxis Core Academic Skills Test, and $300 for the edTPA. 

Check the definition of ""give"":

1. freely transfer the possession of (something) to (someone); hand over to.
2. cause or allow (someone or something) to have (something, especially something abstract); provide or supply with.

Again, nobody wants to ""give"" you a gun, as in issuing you one or having them available to sign out in the school office.  The entire discussion is surrounding licensed individuals being allowed to conceal carry on school property.  We are talking about removing a prohibition, not about giving anybody anything.  

Besides, I have several firearms, thank you.  I do not need or want or advocate for a school-issued firearm or to be given a firearm(nor does anybody), especially if it works as well as my school issued computer or the high school copier.

Let's examine your original statement:

&gt;they would trust with guns but question what we say with regards with CRT

Have you been trained to carry a firearm?  Have you undergone marksmanship training?  Do you even own a firearm?  If the answer to any of these is ""no"", nobody wants to give you a gun.  And ironically, my guess is that in general, the Venn diagram of teachers pushing CRT and that of teachers whom we should not trust with guns due to inexperience or ineptitude is a circle.

;tldr - if you're a big fan of CRT, they never wanted to give you or allow you to have a gun in the first place.  It's a false equivalency."
highschoolteachers,"I don’t think I saw this addressed here, but the pressure for the perfect room (one I happen not to experience at the high school where I teach) seems to be shouldered largely by female teachers.  It’s why I chafe against the expectation a bit.  I’m pretty spartan- bare-ish walls, rows are the default seating, etc.  I don’t really care about decor, to start, and I’m just not spending time/money to bedazzle my room.  I’ve got no problem with other teachers going all-out, though.  Just not my thing."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school biology. I don't decorate for my students, I decorate for me. I have a clock in the back of the room as well as science related art that I like to look at. On the side walls I just hang up student work so they can be proud of what they have done.
I also made ""bulletin boards"" by hanging up a plastic dollar store table cloth and putting borders on them and just tacking things into the wall... it works.

In terms of looking for teaching tips online, I have found that watching videos online of teachers actually teaching is really helpful. Edutopia on youtube has some decent content.

Best of luck to you."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with you. I teach high school and kids hardly notice the stuff on the walls. I tend to decorate with work the students do. 

1. This looks great when admin walk in
2. The kids get excited when they make it on the wall."
highschoolteachers,"My high school students are in my room only 90 miniutes every other day. The decor in the room is for me. The ""pretty"" part of my room has nature posters and decor; forests, waterfalls, mountains etc. If Ikea has a really god sale, I might change the posters occasionally.  I have a few live plants as well. There is one wall where I post important information, but I keep it very simple and clean and change it only when necessary. Everything that requires constant updates goes on my website or Google classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I relate! Last year was my first year too, but I teach 8th grade math. I’ll be going from cohorts of 18 to classes of 30. Still waiting to hear if they are going to require us to “social distance” with those numbers. I am definitely intimidated by the potential for more management challenges. 

My only advice that worked pretty well in hybrid is to find some management system/routines that you use every day and reinforce regularly. I use the power teaching teacher vs students strategy among others. I also used classroom jobs and group roles which helped some (a lot of “naughty” kids like having the right job). This may not translate as well to high school, but you may be able to adapt it."
highschoolteachers,"Great to see another Aussie here, and inspiring to hear your story, mate. Teaching high school (12-18 yr olds for the yanks out there) I feel that my exercise routine is definitely my school. It can pay off to be a good role model, say what healthy food I ate, and healthy activities I did on the weekend. I'm in a lockdown school this week, and it is going to drag. Term 3 was going so well!

Hope you have a great rest of the term!"
highschoolteachers,"I taught 7/8 resource room for a decade. I was fortunate enough for a two year span to have enough space for a corner with low lights, my old stereo and big box ear headphones, a couch and a recliner from a garage sale. It really did make a difference with the students that had anxiety issues (which seems to be most of them these days). I had a young lady with test anxiety who could be in the general education setting and score a 30% on an exam she had worked hard to prepare for and then retake it on an old coffee table sitting on the couch blaring her music (thinking it was the Spice Girls back then) and get in the high 90s two hours later. To the point where the general education teacher accused us of cheating and came to my room for planning the next time (I was helping grade tests as far as the student knew). That’s some serious anxiety. A few boys who’s anxiety was more outwardly manifested would come in and put on Green Day or Korn for 20 minutes and their write ups and office trips went down considerably.

Another thing I noticed is a few students who were profoundly ADHD/ADD would make the honor roll during football, wrestling and to a lesser extent cross country and fail miserably during their down time. They needed the physical contact and exertion to keep their chemicals in balance? One of the moms got her son into martial arts after this and he excelled all the way through high school.

My point is don’t paint your kids with a broad brush. Welcome them, make an effort to know each one for who they are. Make sure you provide a safe, positive and loving environment for them (many of your resource students have never known anything but failure and negativity, there’s a high chance that one or both of their parents had the same experience and do not support school at home) a kid cannot learn in a “fight or flight” state and you’re tasked with the impossible duty of finding the answers for their quirks. 

You will lose as often as you win but 15 years from now seeing a student who was a basket case married with kids, working a decent job and just living a happy and productive life makes it worth it."
highschoolteachers,"The best thing I can tell you is to approach every kid, even if they’re having a behavior issue at the time (with the exception of a major safety issue), from a place of concern for them. “Hey there Demarcus, I notice you’re feeling a little chatty today, but you’re getting behind on your work. What can we do to help you focus so you can finish that lab sheet?” Tone of voice is important; you’re still firm and not sing songy, but you’re putting the focus on student success and not just fussing at them. All kids want to be successful, but most need some help sometimes to act that way. Basically, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. 

I also try to keep the preacher teacher time to a minimum. I flipped my class so I don’t have to compete for whole class attention. I had a horrible class of kids who were not successful in middle school and had very few skills to operate in a high school classroom. Once I stopped demanding them to be quiet and focus on me and put them to work on student centered learning, things got way better. It removes the opportunity to act dumb for peer attention and puts the ball in their court. 

Lastly, I notice you teach a lot of SPED kids. Really keep the focus on scaffolding for all your kids, but especially your low babies. Behavior amps up when they feel frustrated and not capable. It is okay if there are a few gimme questions on each assignment. It’s better to build up their confidence than to stretch them too far too soon. I would keep the ratio close to 2 parts questions you know they can answer for every 1 part you know is a stretch."
highschoolteachers,"I always try to bring in as many natural elements as I can, it makes the space reflect the outdoors and makes for a very calm, neutral environment. Go outside and see what you can find to make things and decorate with. 

Also, check the dollar stores first before buying stuff. It tends to be lower quality, but it works while you save up for better (and if you're teaching high school it would probably last awhile. My students are 3-5 and wreck it so fast...). 

Last, see if you have a Buy Nothing or Freecycle group in your area. Useful things for classrooms pop up quite frequently."
highschoolteachers,"The federal government according to the department of education’s website provides on average about 8 percent of a public schools budget. That 8 percent is also split up by literally everything the federal government provides from funding for meal plans to any additional funds used to support the school. 

Additionally, When the federal government increases funding to schools they’re often making use of things they have more squarely in their domain to do so, for example the Biden whitehouse ties a lot of their programs to title I schools which already receive a larger share of federal funding. Similarly the No Child left behind act didn’t actually require schools to teach to the curriculum it entailed, it was more like a threat to remove funding from other parts of the states budget if they didn’t comply. So as with many things with questions of the federal governments power the answer solidly falls between probably and maybe.

That being said there’s still that 92% of funding made by the state and local governments. This might be the idealist social studies teacher in me but you can make a difference. If you really care about the salary you make reach out to the people who can change it. Go to town meetings, get to know all of your representatives, research not only how higher salaries affect not only your life but the education of students as a whole. Local elections sometimes struggle to reach the triple digits in turnout, making this a do or die issue for you and every one you know can cost a city councilor their job. There was an anecdote I got when I was in a high school civics class myself. My teacher went to discuss issues of education with a state senator and he actually made a big difference getting the legislation he wanted passed through (unfortunately I don’t remember what it was) as he was quite literally the only person who lobbied with the representative."
highschoolteachers,"Oh FFS, we don't need more money for civics education. We already teach civics. A lot. Every kid who graduates high school has learned about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the three branches of govt, separation of powers, checks and balances, and federalism multiple times. What we need are students who care about learning."
highschoolteachers,We had an elementary teacher move up to high school. She brought all her posters with her. And her Catholic school perfect cursive.
highschoolteachers,"The most memorable decoration I remember was in my AP calculus teacher's room in high school.  Everybody had their name written about 5 feet off the ground, going all the way around the room.  When you screwed up the Chain Rule, you added a link to a paper chain under your name.

We learned the Chain Rule real quick."
highschoolteachers,"How should I decorate my high school English classroom? I am a second year teacher who didn't decorate at all last year due to COVID. This year, I feel like we will also have to go virtual because of COVID at some point, but I want to start the year off with a slightly decorated classroom... I've literally amassed no materials or decorations (only books, but I have no shelves to put them on) from coworkers. My problem is that I want to spend very little money, preferably under like 30 bucks. Does anybody have any tricks of a small thing I can buy or do to make my blank classroom a little more welcoming for students?"
highschoolteachers,"I like for my students to make their own contributions to the classroom decor. Not ALL students- but students who are artistic and wish to be commissioned for a classroom contribution. As a high school math teacher, I’ve been fortunate to be in a classroom with colorful mandalas, a fractal tree that takes up an entire wall, and some portraits of Leibniz and Newton. I feel as though it gives them a sense of belonging and ownership in the classroom? Who knows. But one thing is for certain, there are not any posters of golden retrievers wearing sunglasses or F-15 planes encouraging us to “ascend to great heights.” Not that there’s anything wrong with that!"
highschoolteachers,"Yes! And yet, I taught high school and my admin said I should decorate my room more. It's not always the teacher's choice."
highschoolteachers,"This is pretty much what I did for high school science. I posted 10-30 minutes of lecture, including me walking through practice problems every day I ""had class"" then had a couple 1 hour windows of time for students to drop in and ask questions or for me to shore up anything. I made short Google Form quizzes for each video that had to be done within 48 hours to attempt assessment.

I had fairly good results, but my pacing was maybe 20% of what it would have been any other year. As always there were a few students this did not work for (or that did no work) but most got the hang of it after a week or two."
highschoolteachers,"Wow lol talk about a low bar. I probably should’ve mentioned that I only have 13 students because I am supposed to be the lead teacher for an alternative program at a high school. So I suppose the idea of them coming to show up live would’ve worked for the 13 kids but the people who designed it did not take into account that our students have jobs and that’s part of the reason why they are in our program. Like they are very very likely and at risk of dropping out in order to continue working because part of the problem is that school doesn’t appeal to them and they are growing up. So naturally the people who designed this totally forgot that and then gave them no opportunities outside of synchronous learning. And go figure that everyone is failing, and those who are actually trying, they have like low C’s. Why would they even keep trying? They were already not motivated by grades"
highschoolteachers,"I can assure you that you are well within your lane to try and help motivate him. Unfortunately, as the saying goes ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink"". 

What you may find effective is showing him the meaning of why he should do his work. Salary statistics of high school dropouts vs those with a high school diploma or higher. Show him the jobs available to a high school dropout or flunk-out.  Show him why he's learning this stuff or cool applications of the classes he is in. 

Alternatively, and this is probably the approach I'd personally take. Let him crash and burn, and get his ass handed to him. Failure and pressure (to actually do the work) can be a great motivator. If the teachers are allowing him to turn assignments in whenever then that's on them for allowing this situation to happen.

There has to be a point where you worry about yourself and how best you are serving yourself and the other students you tutor."
highschoolteachers,"Just make sure it's really the kids you are doing it for, and that it is not to your own detriment.

In one of my first years teaching, I was having a really shitty time with some high school seniors, and I asked one that I felt pretty comfortable with if he could offer any advice.

""Mr. ProfilesInDiscourage,"" he said. ""You care a lot more about us than we do about you.""

It was a punch in the gut, but it might have been the best thing I could have heard. It made me evaluate what was really worth the effort. And busting my ass for kids who thought I was a joke wasn't.

I still work hard for my kids, but I know where to draw the line, and depression and self-loathing are a bridge too far."
highschoolteachers,I did positive emails home this year (my first) and NEVER had a parent respond. Should I keep doing it? I’m a high school teacher if that helps.
highschoolteachers,"Not an ASD teacher, but my son (high school sophomore) is high-functioning ASD and distance learning has been a thick slice of hell. His teachers have been great about accommodations, but it’s been rough. Although each kid is different and ymmv, some thoughts:

1.  Understand that a kiddo on the spectrum may not be able to join in video learning. Even phone calls are difficult, so video is right out. 

2. Kids on the spectrum will need much more specific directions than neurotypical  kids to complete tasks. Much. More. Specific. That executive functioning piece is huge. 

3. Cut the workload. Much much easier to get overwhelmed and shut right down. 

4.  Most of all, remember that none of this is a choice. If the teacher is feeling frustrated, the kid is feeling 100 times more so. 

Hope that helps a bit. 

4."
highschoolteachers,"Our superintendent, of a small suburban 1 high school district, has a car allowance. Why? And he makes 6 figures the same as a district with 6 high schools. Worked in the district his whole career. And he was the choice after a “search” where they spent $10k each on three other candidates that we all knew they weren’t going to choose."
highschoolteachers,"Your welcome, I only visited Washington, Nevada and Hawaii. I work for a private school and there are certain things that I don’t about it. 

Actually my history and English teachers in high school made me enjoy learning again. I moved to another city and I started to skip school. After I took their classes, and I started being a good student again. My history teacher also taught government too. 

Makes sense that Memphis and Birmingham to be liberal with all the movements happened there.

I taught in English conversation in group study at the University, where I studied abroad in Seoul. I noticed the students are very respectful to teachers more than here in my school district. I volunteered teaching little kids at a festival and they listened to my every word. My teaching experiences were great in South Korea."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;bluster could accomplish. 

I provided concrete issues that you had no response to except ignore them and reply as if I'd written something entirely different. You are creating more problems than you solve, taking from currently troubled high school students in favor of adults who were given an opportunity when they were younger and didn't use it. You should be ashamed of what you are doing. Now that I know about you, I will be sure more teachers know about you."
highschoolteachers,"Bags are very personal to the user and what they personally carry. I don't think you're going to find the ""one perfect bag;"" if you ask 100 teachers what they use, I bet you'll get 100 answers. 

I use a purse and a canvas grocery bag for my laptop and lunch. If I bring papers home, I use some green Ikea bins. They are from the kids section.

Edit: I additionally don't think there will be much difference in what works for elementary vs what works for high school. Bags are bags are bags.

Edit edit: if you actually want suggestions, I would recommend r/femalefashionadvice or r/malefashionadvice. You should come up with a list of actual requirements. For example, what colors and materials do you like? Bag or backpack? Price range? Laptop size? What else do you expect to carry on a regular basis?

But honestly, I would not worry about it right now. Wait until you're in the classroom (which may be a year with covid) and have a better idea of what you will be carrying around. I know as a semi-recent grad that it feels really exciting and you just want to buy cool stuff to feel more ready, but you probably shouldn't spend money on stuff without knowing exactly what your needs will be in the classroom. So many of my expectations changed in the first month of being in the classroom and I imagine it will be similar for you."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school so I’m not really sure about the differences between secondary and elementary but I always ask about lesson plans and prep periods. Something like, what does your planning look like?"
highschoolteachers,"Most admins I've known were in it for the money.  And that's fine.  It's good money.  At the high school level you end up spending a ton of time on extra-curriculars so be aware of that.  Most admins are either gunning for a principalship and are fairly motivated or else they just kind of get into the grind of being an AP.  There's a lot of BS but it's also a pretty secure job and once you figure it out it's easy.  Just meet your deadlines.

In 20 years I've been blessed with pretty good APs and principals.  My fav APs/principals are the ones who had my back.  At the least, get both sides of the story before throwing a teacher to the wolves.

I think admin can be fulfilling but it's more about adult relationships than it is about the kids so much.  I have no desire to do it but I think you can grow a passion for most any job.

But really I'd talk to admins in your district about how things are."
highschoolteachers,"I agree, college should be one of many options. However, when [college grads earn on average 56% more than high school grads](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/12/pay-gap-between-college-grads-and-everyone-else-record/96493348/), can you really blame families for wanting to send their students to college?

In many areas of the country, vocational programs are not seen as viable alternatives to getting a bachelor's degree. Not having a bachelor's degree is currently a major disadvantage in the job market. I don't think it should be this way, which is why I support expanded, academically rigorous vocational education programs that can convince students, families, and employers that they are actually good options. 

The more fundamental issue is that American society as a whole is extremely inequitable, but [many Americans underestimate levels of inequality and are overly optimistic about progress towards equality.](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/39/10324) ""Meritocratic"" college admissions contributes to and legitimizes this inequality, and affirmative action policies that try to address this are [under serious attack](https://www.educationdive.com/news/justice-department-backs-appeal-in-harvard-affirmative-action-lawsuit/573027/) or have already been banned, [to the detriment of disadvantaged applicants.](https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning//_files/uc-affirmative-action.pdf)

Race-based affirmative action policies are not perfect, just like how test-score based admissions policies are not the primary cause of inequality. However, race-based affirmative action policies have been shown to benefit (certain groups of) disadvantaged students, whereas test-based admissions policies systematically disadvantage less privileged students."
highschoolteachers,"OMG, on top of that, you're a charter school. I will be sure to talk to the union about opposing your prison charter school getting funding while traditional public schools suffer with historically massive cuts.

Every public dollar spent on your prison charter school is a dollar taken from K-12 education due to the $52+ billion budget deficit. Harm K-12 education and by extension you harm at-risk youth (say goodbye to counselors, classroom aides, anything but bare minimum resource staff for learning disabilities), making at-risk youth more likely to not graduate high school, more likely to end up in prison.

Sit this budget crisis out instead of growing the prison population by taking from at-risk high school students. Place your program into a state agency (I don't mean a charter school) and during a normally funded year, I'd fully support it."
highschoolteachers,"Anybody who has a half-functioning brain and has been through high school and college should be able to waltz into that test and pass it, if not ace it.

Look at the ETS study guide - it’s 8th grade math. The example questions are fairly indicative of the types of questions on the actual test, so they’re a good place to start."
highschoolteachers,It is if the degree curriculum is mainly used as vocational. Ex. campus ministry at the high school level.
highschoolteachers,"Finishing my 12th year (HS Science) and I love this. A few things to add (especially for high school):
1. You don’t need to grade everything. Feedback is important, but not every problem of every worksheet needs to be checked and passed back. Spot check, and go over the answers with the class. 
2. Yes! To the positive calls and persistent behavior issue calls...but keep a spreadsheet. When the time comes to finally write a kid up, you will have data to back up that you did allllll of the classroom level interventions. 
3. Relationships are everything. That paired with some mutual respect will get you 99% of the way there with kids."
highschoolteachers,"With a $52 billion state budget deficit (and growing) it is not going to happen... not when public schools (which comprise 40% of the general budget) are set to be gutted. People will want to support the kids still in high school, not the ones that failed to graduate when schools had proper funding."
highschoolteachers,"Kids humor is not as developed. What I thought were hilarious YouTube videos in high school and middle school now seem completely inane.

On the flip side there are some TV shows that I now find funny, whereas I used to not get it. 

Don't get me wrong, once in a while a student will hot the nail on the head and crack me up. But a lot of their humor is.. not as developed."
highschoolteachers,"The nature of the job for a Music teacher versus a Science teacher is worth considering.  

At the middle and high school level in my district, being a Music teacher means you are cult leader for the marching band.  An incredible amount of dedication to maintaining the program.  Band camp, Disney field trips, half-time shows, that kind of thing.  I don't know much about elementary music, but think it involves seeing a rotating bunch of kids.  

Being a Science teacher means you are regular teacher.  Being a physics teacher with an interest in music would be fantastic.  Our last chapter was on sound and music with an emphasis on how instruments work.  In any case, as a regular teacher, you could informally work with the music teachers."
highschoolteachers,"I was watching a class last year during a pep rally. The only kids left were the ones who didn't buy tickets and one kid (a freshman) brought the money to buy a ticket but spent it on candy instead

Well the thing about freshman in high school is that they believe literally any rumor they hear and, apparently, the hot take was that there was a sound cloud rapper at the Pep rally

His name? Jizzle.

So about every 4 minutes I heard this kid complain under his breath too his friends ""man i wanna see Jizzle!""

And it's difficult having to keep yourself from laughing at that as an adult"
highschoolteachers,"I definitely wouldn’t mind having fun all day! Haha. I do also think that teaching about science would be a joy, but the downer would be most of my kids probably wouldn’t think so, which is another reason music is so appealing. The kids are just as passionate as myself, if not more so! (usually).

If I can ask, what made the days so hard with the elementary music? 

When I think of going the music route that is the ideal scenario I have as well! And I would definitely be all over the extracurricular scene, that would be so rewarding! I had a similar idea for science, as far as making a little competition team (I did this in junior high school!) but I imagine any extracurricular anything would depend on the school? I’m glad to have the input that not every music job is probably going to be the ideal though! Looking at everything in the rose colored way I do, I would more than likely have overlooked that possibility"
highschoolteachers,"Oh yeah, it’s terrible. It does nothing but reinforce laziness and sets them up for failure later because they don’t form good habits before high school."
highschoolteachers, This is a huge reason why our high school freshmen struggle to take high school seriously.  They've always gotten passed along no matter what.
highschoolteachers,"If you read the study, the authors actually found that, at high achievement levels, ACT scores were negatively correlated with college readiness. They state that

&gt;there is little evidence that students will have more college success if they work to improve their ACT score because most of the signal from the ACT score seems to represent factors associated with the student’s school rather than the student.

I don't think that standardized tests are inherently bad. Students should be assessed on what they've learned from school, and these assessments should be comparable. What I disagree with is the use of standardized tests to perpetuate the myth that American college admissions is a fair and equitable process. Moreover, the obsession with test scores results in unhealthy competition and credentialism, and it distorts the goals of public education.

If I could remake American public higher education, I'd first start from high school. If it weren't for the massive devaluation of high school diplomas over the past few decades, not everyone would need or want to go to university. Students who don't want to attend university should have the option to enroll in vocational training programs that would provide them with professional certifications and guaranteed job placements.

Students who want to attend university should have to take a rigorous state-administered graduation exam which is closely aligned to the high school curriculum. Passing this exam (no matter the score) should grant you a high school diploma and a guaranteed spot at a state university. Students would rank their preferences, and if schools were overenrolled, a lottery taking preferences and/or proximity into account would be run. Ideally, states would recognize each other's diplomas, and admission would be opened to out-of-state students after all in-state students had been admitted.

Community colleges could serve as the providers of many vocational programs, as well as transfer programs into university for adult learners.

States might elect to establish a few elite universities or programs with separate admissions policies and/or their own entrance exams. Similarly, private universities could continue to have their own admissions policies. I have no issue with this, as long as there's no pretense that this is somehow fair or equitable."
highschoolteachers,"Okay, here's a long-ass answer. Calculus was invented about 50 years after the invention by Descartes of the Cartesian coordinate system, and really made popular and known about 80 years after, almost exactly 300 years ago. Descartes literally invented the graph of the polynomial. 

It's hard for us to understand how *separate* the disciplines were. In the 1000 years prior, geometry had settled into being a proofs based system with a fairly understood sequence for teaching. This was used as training for priests, and the upper class, and represented a fundamental belief in *certainties*. 

When they asked, ""How many angels could dance on the head of a pin?"", this was a *real* question that they thought would allow them to use the absolute dictates of an internally coherent logical system to make statements about the physics and understanding of the universe. Descartes' *cogito* uses this kind of mapping from internal ideation to external validity to round off the stumbling fourth step of the cogito. 

* I think therefore I am

* I am, therefore I must be in *something*

* I can imagine a perfect benevolent God. 

* Because I can imagine perfection, therefore perfection, and therefore God, exists. 

* and because he's a benevolent God, he wouldn't leave me to be a brain in a jar, and so therefore the world exists. 

* I think --&gt; therefore reality exists. 

Anyway, long story longer: The rise and development of Al-Jebra rose out of trading and Silk Road, so think Marco Polo (13th century). By the writing of Descartes, it's had about three centuries to percolate outwards, and upwards in class. However, it's still seen as very dirty, lower class. Think of how a priest might feel about the mathematics of a merchant CPA. Separate. 

Along comes Descartes, and says, ""well what if we try placing plane geometry - which has only two tools, the compass (fixed distance) and the straight edge. It does NOT have angles ratios, in the trigonometric sense, though certain triangle ratios have been explored in proofs. So this is the birth of **analytic geometry** and **functions**. 

50 years later, *using that new tool*, Isaac Newton and Liebnitz begin to consider limit functions as instantaneous rates of change. *Out* of that - not before, trigonometry is developed to what we think of as trig in 1745. 

So now you have **algebra**, specifically equation solving, and a new discipline, *analytic geometry*, and now a **new** discipline, **trigonometry**. 

Once you had studied each of these, in depth, you could begin to understand Newton's Calculus, and by the time of the birth of trig several hundred people or more could do Calculus, with more becoming interested all the time. 

Now let's look at the state of education. In the world of the 17th century, much if not most education was within the framework of the seminary and the idea of the modern college was emerging. Harvard - 1636. Yale - 1701  Cambridge and Oxford and the University of Paris had lineages as old as the mid 12th century, but perhaps it's best to view those in the context of being THE school, not in a world of readily available schools. By the foundation of the United States, Calculus and Trigonometry exist in the world and some people at the University - some - study it. 

Literally at the same time as the birth of Trigonometry and the spread of calculus is the **industrial revolution**. They are the same thing. They are part and parcel of one another. Things that mark the industrial revolution were only possible through the birth of these new mathematics, such as standardization of bolts and screws, the ability to manufacture matching parts, etc. Eli Whitney built his factory for interchangeable gun parts in 1798. 

So the upper class, and some middle and lower class adults who develop some skills and get into colleges (the seminary was a way for the poor to become educated), are studying Calculus not at the post-grad level, but now at the graduate level, and now the undergraduate level. Calculus *requires* you to be deeply facile in the other three disciplines, algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. As younger and younger students are needing that, the study of these things gets pushed into teen schooling, first at boarding schools for the middle and upper class, and then of course we have the invention of the modern public school by Horace Mann in the mid 19th century, and by the late 19th century, public schools **begin** to outnumber private schools. Dewey, at the turn of the 20th century, began convincing Americans that education should be free, universal, and focused on character and civic virtue, not simply trade school or erudition. 

In the 20th century, mathematics at the high school level was frequently, if not almost universally, taught as Algebra, Trig and Geometry, and calculus for those who could achieve it. As soon as calculus entered the public high school system, it re-oriented the purpose of the other classes, just as the invention of calculus had conjoined algebra and geometry two hundred years early. This can be viewed as the driver for mathematical reform in the 70s and 80s (""New Math"") and our current trend towards integrated mathematics and communication in mathematics. 


Obviously, I've skipped a million things, but here's the **tl:dr - of course you'll never USE calculus in the middle school or even high school level, but if teachers didn't have to take calculus, they would have zero idea of what the pieces of the puzzle fit together to make.**"
highschoolteachers,"You need to really look at the feasibility of becoming a professor at a college. Full time-tenured positions rarely open up and you are competing against a lot of folks. Also, once a professor you will be doing mostly research instead of teaching the class. This does not apply though if you only plan on being an associate/adjunct instructor.

As for high school teaching, this is a different beast. Each state will have different requirements and demands for subject areas. You can do a job search in your surrounding district to see what kind of demand there are for English teachers (yes, even during this covid-19 situation they are still hiring). For California, almost all districts use edjoin.org for all job listing."
highschoolteachers,I didn’t say mass school shooting. My high school had a shooting. One person died. I feel like that is tragic enough. Doesn’t have to be a UTA or Columbine situation.
highschoolteachers,"Hey, as you become a math teacher, consider this as a ‘cheat sheet’ to content. Do the exercise yourself, because the point is to orient you to content.

Set up khan for the standard set for your district - ccss In Oregon and Washington, for example. 

Then, make a spreadsheet. Start a few years earlier than what you’ll be teaching. For example, I am a high school teacher and became a 7th grade teacher this year, so to understand depth and breadth I started with fourth grade.

Make a list of the quizzes in each section. Don’t go down in the weeds, this is about wrapping your head around the entire arc.

So one column: 4th grade, another one 5th grade, etc. 


Those section and quizzes match up in weird ways year to year, which makes sense if you think about it - you need combos of previous years’ topics to do the next year. 8th grade Pythagorean theorem needs powers, roots, addition, subtraction, and equation solving. 

It took me an hour or two, plus I like to color code the sections and add dates. I did this when covid began and was trying to plan out my year, wish I’d done it earlier. 

Here’s mine:

highschoolteachers,"I dealt with this during my student teaching. I’ve had all of my social media’s on private/ super restricted for as long as I have been able to. That doesn’t stop high schoolers from trying to find their student teacher and friending them. One of my student found my Instagram and requested to follow me. I immediately deleted the request and decided that I was going to have a talk with all of my students about respecting my personal space online. I didn’t mention the student’s name or what class he was in, but I know the point got across. 

You are allowed to have a life outside of the school, and to have an online presence. If they want to find you they will, but in no way shape or form do you have to let them into your online life."
highschoolteachers,"It is never to late. 

Do you have a bachelors degree? If not get an education degree and basically go from there. You can start at your local community college and get you associates before starting at a university. This will save you money. Then transfer to a university to finish up your last 2 years. At that point you need to decide what you want to teach. Elementary, middle or high school. Not every university offers all degree options. Idk if any universities in OH offer online teaching degrees. 

If you already have a bachelors (in any field) you go through an alternative certification program and get certified that way."
highschoolteachers,"I do not know why and when it changed to us having to be responsible for students not turning in their work. My teachers, in middle and high school, told me the assignment and I either did it got a grade or didn't and got an F. And it was never the teachers faul and they only told me once. I got told once and if it didn't get done my parents would put the blame on me, rightfully. Parents are what I like least about my profession."
highschoolteachers,"If you don’t end up getting a job and schools are open, try to sub in as many different districts as possible. I subbed for 2.5 year before I got my first full time job. I did long-term positions in middle school science, high school biology, 9th grade English, middle school Spanish and a few middle school social studies. I was a preferred sub at a lot of districts around me. I don’t live in that area anymore (moved out of state for my husband’s job) but I still keep in touch with the principals and am hoping that if/when we move back I’ll be able to use those connections. 

I had more job rejections than I can count and it definitely sucks, but you just need to keep your head up and apply for everything you can."
highschoolteachers,"Seconding the recommendation to do substitute teaching, if you can afford it. After finishing my credential (and not getting hired at the school I'd done student teaching for), I got substitute-certified for two other districts and bounced around their schools for a year. It really gives you perspective for each school on 1) what the students can be like on their worst days and 2) how the teachers/staff treat people who might be considered ""dispensable"" (subs and new teachers). 

I ended up finding my current high school halfway through the sub year. The staff is incredible and friendly, the students are still occasionally dicks (but the majority of them are polite and empathetic), and the campus is fantastic. I honestly think I'm a lot happier here than I would have been at my first choice of my student teaching school."
highschoolteachers,"""We don't know how to get him to do his work.""

""I don't want you to think we are ignoring you."" (no responses for 4 weeks, calls, emails, texts, etc)

""Only 2 weeks to complete all that work?"" -  Unfortunately, I can't extend the school year for your procrastinating senior high school student, who waited 6 weeks before getting started on school work. I have impoverished special ed clinically depressed students turning in their work. Your kid has no excuse."
highschoolteachers,"Classroom management in high school was pretty laid back in my classroom. Need a tissue? To go to the restroom? Get up, don’t cause a distraction, and come back quietly. No practicing needed. Do what you need to do and don’t waste anyone’s time. Spoiler alert: this did NOT work in my middle school classroom. 

After moving from high school to 7th grade, my classroom management was absolute shit the first 9+ weeks. I was NOT prepared to have explicit directions for everything. Middle schoolers need lots of reinforcement, and expectations need to be taught, modeled, and revisited routinely. They want you to think they’re independent, but they most certainly are not. I was ready to quit after the first semester, to be honest. 

I’m now entering my 4th year in middle school (2 years in 7th, 1 in 6th, and upcoming in 7th), and I love it. They’re goofy. They have hilarious stories to tell. Most are willing to engage and participate. There’s still some level of hand holding in the beginning as they learn the rules, but as long as you stick firmly to your rules and expectations—and consequences—it gets a lot easier. If you can think of absolutely anything in the classroom where you can establish expectations and routines, do it."
highschoolteachers,"I can think of some ways in which knowledge of high school level calculus (so-called horizon content knowledge) can help inform instruction in earlier courses. For example, I see a unit on piecewise functions in Algebra 1 as an opportunity to get students thinking (informally) about limits and continuity, and this exploration can be a great way to have them put into practice their understanding of piecewise functions. And I think there are lots of other examples of where knowledge of calculus and real analysis can deepen instruction, not just in algebra but in geometry as well. 

But I agree that calculus is kinda overrated. I'd rather that middle school teachers be expected to know number theory and be able to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic than be expected to know calculus and be able to do integration by parts. It'd be nice if we could have both."
highschoolteachers,"True. Thanks. I guess I'm mostly just embarrassed? Or a little worried that it will impact my ability to look like the responsible adult in the room. But you're right. Thinking back to my high school days, this would probably only score a teacher points with me."
highschoolteachers,"I am at a high school.  We are required to reach out for every missed assignment.  I make a generic email that this week's assignment is missing and bcc all of the students and parents.  I am VERY careful that it is bcc.  If I accidentally shared that with names visible, I would be in a world of trouble."
highschoolteachers,"Are you required by the school to send these emails? (question is for everyone) 

I'm doing a long term high school assignment right now and I can't imagine sending e-mails for missing assignments, to parents. It would be way too time consuming for me. But I'm wondering if some primary school teachers are required to."
highschoolteachers,"I agree 100%.  There is so much gaming of grades already.  I teach at a high school that's known for tough grading, so the pressure to move away from real grades will get even worse."
highschoolteachers,It will start with a few schools making their own tests. Then a few more. Until so many schools are administering their own unique tests that the burden on students becomes too great suppressing application rates for each school. So a handful of universities will team up to give a Common Admissions Test to make it more convenient and attractive to high school graduates. Then the group will expand as more schools want access to a broader applicant pool the test attracts. Until finally the non-participating schools feel enough pressure to standardize their own admission tests to align more closely to the common test. Finally every school will decide on a single standardized admissions test for all college applicants. They will call it the SAT for convenience.
highschoolteachers,"I totally feel you on this! I have the same exact thoughts. I'm a high school band director and we are unsure on even how to carry out a program and still be successful next year. Sure, there are ways but it's going to be a pain in the ass. I just finished my 5th year as a teacher. For a lot districts in my area we had to make this grading period higher than last for students even if they were passing this current period. So a kid who maybe got a 90 last grading period and didn't do jack during the pandemic (even thought the student and parents had all the materials provided to them) has to receive a 91 for this current grading period. And then the students who worked and received true grades may score below the kids who didn't do shit. With us having to change grades like that, what was the point of distance learning?!? Every year I at least know three people who quit teaching and I'm sort of leaning towards that choice as well. I notice with almost every school these days admin doesn't care for students and teachers. It's a business now. Scores and money is what matters and being better than every one else by creating misleading expectations and throwing kids into ""college courses"" that don't do anything for a student in the end."
highschoolteachers,"I have to ask something out of ignorance. I’m currently a career paramedic in the middle of moving to a new career. As it happens that career is hopefully teaching high school biology although I haven’t ruled out becoming an EMS educator full time. What exactly makes a colleague toxic in the environment of an educator? I get that there’s just shit heads at every work place, but what could someone do to really make your week a bad one? 
Again, asking out of ignorance. I’ve spent over a decade of my adult life working with the public and couldn’t have been more removed from public education."
highschoolteachers,"I once worked in a very large high school and almost the entire English department was on some sort of meds for anxiety and/or depression. I think it’s pretty common for teachers to struggle with mental health issues, unfortunately."
highschoolteachers,"Hey man, don't worry.  I'm not from California but I've got some advice.

1. Don't panic.  If you were laid off because of budget cuts your are golden.  It's stressful and it sucks.  But you know what, I've been laid off before too and it's led to better opportunities that I never would have gotten if I didn't get canned.

2. They were right!  Math and science ARE in high demand and you are in a better position than many of your peers.

3. The highest demand is in high school Chem and Physics, especially physics.

4. Again, don't panic, in states where school starts in September, HALF of all positions are filled in August.

5. Contact your professors if they are local and see if they can help you getting a job.  They may have connections because odds are their students are currently administrators in public schools.  You can also check out your colleges career center for help.

6. Send out at least a 100 applications.

7. If you have already paid for next semester call them and tell them you want to pause because you lost your job.  Make sure figure something out with your loans as well.

8.  Apply to every job you can that's also not teaching so you can make money.

Here's a post I wrote earlier.

Good luck man."
highschoolteachers,"I’m not that observant about my OWN kids, so it’s a bit much for me to expect it from a teacher.  I teach high school and am blown away by the granular details parents expect from elementary teachers ."
highschoolteachers,"We had a high school with 650 seniors and they broke it up into 3 different groups. They had a graduation for students A-G etc. That way each graduate could invite 4 family members. 

Think of how many weren't even able to graduate with their friends."
highschoolteachers,"All of the CDC recommendations are just that: suggestions. States are going to use them to work out their own guidance. In my state, that guidance is going to be filtered again by the local districts.

To wit: your question about changing classes in high school. There’s no way any decent sized high school could keep students in one room. There’s too much difference in schedules for that to make sense. (I often get the feeling that none of my students have the same schedule.) There will have to be class changes. I just don’t know how to do it and enforce distancing! At every HS I’ve ever been in, class change is controlled chaos, with kids walking every which way and people right on top of each other. I’ve seen suggestions of a staggered period release schedule to limit the number of people in the halls, but I’ve no idea how that would work either.

Someone will come up with some plans. Suggestion to you as a student: get some masks, get some latex or nitrile gloves, maybe get a face shield. Don’t wait til August. Oh, and stock up in schools supplies because most places are saying sharing will be out"
highschoolteachers,That's amazing! I'm currently applying to teach high school dance/drill team assistant director. Do you have any advice?
highschoolteachers,high school for me too
highschoolteachers,"You are often, even in junior and senior level high school classes, only learning the basics of whatever content area. 

Most public schooling does a good job of giving students a very broad knowledge base, but not often a very deep one.

Take, for example, your average high school math teacher teaching Algebra or Geometry. To be able to teach high school math, that teacher likely has a college degree in some field of math, and passed a comprehensive secondary math praxis exam.

They could likely explain to you exactly where the quadratic formula came from, what the different parts are for, and how it's useful. But most kids aren't interested in that. They just want to know how to get the answer. So they're told just to memorize the formula, and to plug in the numbers in the right place."
highschoolteachers,"No downvoted from me.  You can feel however you want. I could’ve done without the “no respect” I have zero desire to be one of the spiteful, bitter teachers I remember from high school.  I didn’t love teaching like I hoped I would, but I loved so many of my instructors and  I felt that staying in the classroom disrespected every good teacher I’d ever had.

If you read anything I posted after the initial post, I’m making educational posters.  I’m not one of the reps who shows up to tell teachers how to change what they’re doing and eat up an afternoon when you’d rather be prepping packets and unpacking your supply order. I’m just trying to make classrooms a little prettier, maybe a few more engaged students, and a spark of joy for teachers.  

Mea culpa if that is so onerous to you."
highschoolteachers,"Huh. All of my students have shown up to IEPs since SIP. They’re high school students, but when we were in session there was a lot of refusal"
highschoolteachers,"Point blank: the idea that, since I *chose* to be a teacher, I should tolerate being disrespected. Because, you know, *boys will be boys*. (Always young men who say this to me. I’m a young woman and I teach high school English.)

Also: too many students think that they’ll only learn if the following conditions are met:
1) Their teacher is “cool” (code language for teachers who care more about being liked by their students than challenging them with rigorous content and high behavioral standards);
2) They “like” the subject (code language for not having ever seriously explored their interests, AKA laziness);
3) Learning the material is “easy” (code language for no actual learning is going on, since *learning* requires *productive struggle*); 
4) Little to no classwork or homework is given (code language for not wanting to be expected to do anything at all, ever)

I could go on, but this is plenty to chew on."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for being there for that student. I remember telling my math teacher my senior year that I had run away from home. He gave me his phone number without hesitation. He took a huge risk, seeing as he was a male teacher and I was a female student (granted, I ended up being gay anyway, so nothing was ever gonna happen), but he didn't even think about it. I did not end up needing to ever call him, thankfully, but it meant a lot. He trusted me and cared that much about me, when it felt like many adults really didn't. It's still in my phone today. I also remember texting a health teacher once over a school break week because I was having a panic attack and didn't have anyone else I could call. I didn't even particularly like this teacher, but for some reason she had set up a class group text, so she was the only number I had (this must've been before the math teacher gave me his number). I felt bad, I think she was actually on the beach at the time, but she still took the time to calm me down. Anyway, what I'm trying to say through all of this is that sometimes teachers are the only positive adults in a kid's life. I had a difficult time in high school, and I owe any and all success (and quite frankly, my life)  to the teachers who went above and beyond in supporting a student who needed help."
highschoolteachers,"Are you serious? Every teacher I had as a kid has some sort of weird hall pass. Most teachers I've worked with, including myself when I taught high school, had weird hall passes. This is completely benign, not something someone should lose a license or career over. Are we not allowed to have a sense a humor as teachers anymore? Give me a break. None of the parents, students, or admin had an issue with it. Some random person on facebook did. No one should have their career threatened over a super benign facebook post about a harmless hall pass, that's ridiculous and absurd. There's no reason we should be this hard on teachers. No wonder people leave the profession. We need to stop treating teachers like the children we teach."
highschoolteachers,"Sometimes I think students believe that there is a book hidden somewhere in the school with _all of the correct answers to all of their classes in it._ Students believe that it is their job to try to find this book and, if they do, their schooling is complete!

I wish they understood that the whole purpose of school — especially high school — is to make you into a *thinker!* A problem solver! Someone who can plan and execute an idea! Someone who can look at a piece of writing and see through the bullshit!

Instead, we seem to have a lot of sheep who, at the best of times, mindlessly do what’s in front of them."
highschoolteachers,It’s already happening. My high school recently hired a new teacher a few weeks ago. Last week she was told there’s no longer a position for her.
highschoolteachers,"I went to high school where my mom taught and it made me a little goody two shoes. But I was always that way, I guess. I even struggled in my mom's honors chemistry class (small school, she was the only one who taught honors) &amp; she was the only teacher in my whole life to give me a C.

I just finished my second year. First year I had my principal's son &amp; this year I had my assistant principal's son. Thank god both of them were smart and hardworking. I would've died inside having to write them up or fail them. (I also know, though, that they would have had my back.)

Sorry that happened, OP. Idk how you can be a teacher and not have that understanding."
highschoolteachers,"I have a handful like this. Foster kids, at risk kids, ones that rely on my so much for four years that I know there's no one there to catch them just because they graduate or age out. I don't let them out of my grasp until I know they have a way to reach me if they need to. One that's a current student goes by ""he"" at school, but made sure I know phone calls home need to use ""she"" - I worry about him being himself when he doesn't have our campus as a home anymore. Another one of them texted me the other day asking me to send her transcript to the adult school because she's finally getting her GED after an abusive relationship cost her her high school diploma.  And one from earlier in my career just invited me to her wedding next spring. There's ups and downs of letting kids like that into your heart, but once they are mine I'm not letting them go out into the world without at least me there cheering them on."
highschoolteachers,"Like I said, I was in high school at that point so I unfortunately can’t answer any questions about what the contracts looked like."
highschoolteachers,"Reminds me of my high school senior year English teacher. He’s such a great man!!! He’s beat cancer since I graduated high school (4 yrs ago), turns out he had cancer while I was in school with him(we just didn’t know) and during that summer of us graduating he was going to get treatment. 

I had talked to him about my situation at home throughout the year. I had towards the end come out of the closet along with other such things and my dad reacted a little rude. It was a scary time and such. In fact I think a lot of stuff during that time was because he wasn’t so nice to me and I had so many issues with my health too (seizures) but they were also getting sooo much better! 

And I would sort of rant to my teacher....... so one day I think like during lunch or after school since I would talk to him. He gave me his phone number and he told me if I ever needed someone to pick me up or help me from a really bad situation (my dad had threatened to have my mom choose either I leave or he does... it’s sad to think my mom could maybe choose him tbh, but also other threats) he would be there. He would help me out so I wouldn’t be alone and didn’t have to go through anything alone. And I could call him at any time and he would be there. I never had to use it though. 

I only had a tablet back then (this is about 4 yrs ago) and I remember I saved it but I didn’t ever use it because I graduated and I left home. I was seizure free 7 months. I got my drivers license no thanks to my dad and got into a community college away from home even as my dad threatened and told me he wouldn’t let me leave and that I wouldn’t be able to do it. He was kinda inconsistent because he would say I couldn’t do and he wouldn’t help, and then would help a little but also just stop and say no. Like he bought me a beater car but then it turned to something else. He’s totally different on that now though because I proved him wrong on that since I got my AS last year (took me a while, life doesn’t stop happening just because you’re in school lol) and now I’m getting my BA! Ive held a job just like any other person going to school full-time and having something part time. Plus just recently I got a full-time job and am living in another state while I’ll be going to school to finish my degree! I’ve never given up before and now isn’t the time. 

I’ve worked in schools during college (part-time but lesson plans and such things that I would do at home made it feel like full-time with no pay haha) from being ASP tutor with my own class of students from 1st-3rd grades. I’ve been a substitute tutor for other grades as well as working for summer programs all day teaching stem classes (science/engineering) for the kids! We made workbooks of the projects! I would have about 20-30 students (30 was over summer and I had a co-tutor/teacher and a para-pro who was awesome!!). I couldn’t have more than 20 students just myself because I’m not credentialed like you guys, I just had to take a few exams and training (monthly but also online ones) to be able to hold the job, as well as be in college.  But mannnn I did elementary and those kids can be kinda rough lol but they are really lovable and kind. I miss my kiddos. I moved up to more admin positions where I would run the program and talk to parents more since I’d ID them and their contacts to pick up kids. I memorized over 190 students in program along with their parents. I also put them in classes, updated contact and sign outs, etc. I was all over the school most days. Rough. 

But now I have a different job doing something else and it’s full time lol. The school was just part time but in those few hours I worked and would do lesson plans, file, contact, admin, etc. It felt like I was there all day and to top it off I had school lol with some relatively low pay for what I did. 

I’ve had incredible teachers to help me get at where I’m at today though. Principals, nurses, office staff, random family friends I would meet, classmates. I have too many to count and there’s no way in hell I could repay them. They really helped this socially awkward kid who was having seizures almost everyday if not weeks through the hardest transition he had from being a teen into adulthood. Especially had a teacher who despite going through an extremely hard health battle or knowing he was up for something that could bring death, was still there to be the person to help when it could of been needed. 

I have some of the teachers and principal on Facebook and it’s always so great to see them do great. But seeing him on my feed and knowing he exist gave me hope of the marvelous teachers out there who are truly there to make that change. And I like to think I’ve started something like that too in my run working at schools. I don’t know yet if I want to be a teacher, I guess I’ll just see where my journey to leadership takes me. But don’t ever forget how much you guys are doing for the students like me. If you’re just like him. Remember I’ve gotten this far in life because of you. If no one else has said it today. I appreciate you and everything you do. Much love man. :)"
highschoolteachers,"I’m kind of surprised to see so many people concerned about you giving out your phone number. Granted, I wouldn’t give any of my middle schoolers my phone number, but I had four different teachers’ cell phone numbers in high school! They were all mentors, and remained professional. I guess it just depends on the culture of your school. 

I’m glad you were able to be there for that student and she knew that she could trust you to get her out of a sticky situation."
highschoolteachers,"I only teach the high school curriculum from Big ideas (Math 1-3), but most of the material is pretty good imo. Judging by how some of the material is (some of the ""exploratory"" material assumes a pretty high level student), I'm not surprised to hear about your experience, though.

Have you tried getting a perspective from a co-worker who teaches 6-12 grade? Ive found that while some of the material is presented in a way that I hadn't learned, it is done in a way that is more conceptually sound or cohesive with the overall curriculum."
highschoolteachers,I have gone from high school to elementary.  I kinda loved both but I love elementary more.  It's just a better fit for me.
highschoolteachers,"I've taught both and love both (and both have their challenges as well).  The only way to really tell is to get experience - you can get experience while you're still in high school by asking your guidance counselor to help you set up job shadows with teachers who teach both middle and high school.  Depending on how close the schools in your district are, you could volunteer to help out in both types of classrooms during a study hall you have.  You can also volunteer with after-school programs with both age groups, or get a job at a summer camp for one and then the other age group.  

Just keep in mind though, you might change your opinion as you become an adult yourself (like for instance you might feel too close in age to middle-schoolers now, but that wouldn't be an issue when you're 22 graduating college).  Your own growth into adulthood may affect your perspective in general, too.  If it's possible to get dual certified in both those age groups in your state, that might be a smart idea - then you could have the option of applying for either grade level."
highschoolteachers,"Here’s my huge problem with grades—they have no intrinsic value. Receiving a good grade does not improve your human life in any real way. Just like how being overly motivated by money causes people to lead stressful, overworked, empty lives, being overly motivated by grades leads students to lead empty academic lives.

Let’s assume that it’s possible to design assessments that guarantee that only students who “learn the material” are given good grades. A student who has motivations for learning besides earning good grades would’ve learned the material regardless. A student who is motivated by grades will indeed “learn the material” to succeed in the class, but what happens afterwards? Their learning was instrumental to getting a good grade. Now that they’ve achieved this, unless they continue being graded on this learning and they continue to be grade-motivated, they’ll have no desire to retain anything they’ve learned or to continue learning on their own. And ultimately, there comes a point in everyone’s life where grades are no longer given or grades don’t matter to them anymore. 

My goal as a teacher is not just to get the students to ingest the content and to vomit it all out on their final exam. As a math teacher, I want my students to come to enjoy math, to engage in mathematical practices, and to continue doing this long after they leave my classroom. In my experience, the most grade-motivated students are the ones who are the most resistant to this. That’s why I spend a lot of time trying to help them break free from grades. Unfortunately, by the time many of them get to me in high school, their attitudes towards grades are too deeply ingrained  to be significantly changed in one year. 

My even bigger problem with grades is that they’re misused outside of the classroom to make decisions about students’ futures. As an example, in one of my high school dual-enrollment (college credit) classes, I had a classmate who wasn't prepared enough to take the class. However, this class was required by our high school program. He tried his hardest, but he ended up with a C. He was not only forced to leave the program—he was denied admission to our state university because of his low college credit GPA, even though his high-school credit GPA was higher than average. If he hadn't been required to take the class, he would've been admitted.

This is just one example of how grades can hurt students. Not only will low grades hurt their college admissions chances, low grades can disqualify students from scholarships and financial aid. Issues over grades can stress students' relationships with their families and their peers. And they often improperly influence students' feelings of self-worth and self-efficacy. Why cause so much harm to students over something that has no intrinsic value? That’s why I try not to inflict upon my students the misfortune of having a hard-ass for a teacher.

If I wasn't required to give grades, I'd stop immediately. They're awful. They go against everything I believe about the purpose of education. There are so many better ways to motivate students and to provide them with useful feedback about their learning. I hope that one day, we can dismantle this inhumane system and the greedy corporations that exploit it (looking at you, College Board)."
highschoolteachers,"1) No

2) You don't need a fancy degree from a super expensive college to be a teacher. A girl I know from high school went to Baylor university, paid private tuition for four years, and teaches kindergarten making less than half what she paid PER YEAR at Baylor. My beat advice is to go to a community college for your basics, then transfer to a four year university that has a standard program for you to get a license in the state you want to live in."
highschoolteachers,Please please please work with some ENL teachers! The posters we have for our kids are abysmal. Especially for high school kids - beginner English immediately gets thrown on a poster that looks ... Babyish. (or keep me in mind if you could use an ENL consultant in the future!)
highschoolteachers,"We always have an open house and I don't know how home visits would work for high school. Last year our open house was scheduled before we had scheduled time to work in our rooms, so my room was completely not set up to make a point. Again, I'm high school so that probably flies a bit better for me than it does for elementary.

I wonder if/hope that our open house in August will be canceled."
highschoolteachers,"I LOVE making posters for my high school classroom. I’d kill for this job. Kudos to you for seeing a need and advocating for yourself. I currently teach ELA, but have done the gamut, and have a Science degree. If you happen to remember me when you’re looking for consultants, I’d love to help. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school science and have also taught high school biology and engineering/stem electives. Of those, biology and related topics are much more my thing than physical sciences. I had a very mixed experience with science in K-12 - sometimes I loved it, sometimes I hated it and really struggled. I didn't hit my groove until college, and even then, it wasn't always an easy subject area for me. I think it helps in the end, because once you *get it*, you've got a few more tips and tools for explaining it. I ended up tutoring chemistry privately for a while before I went for my credential, even though I'd failed chem in high school!"
highschoolteachers,"Let me just present a controversial and unpopular opinion about grading and public education in general.  I am ok with any potential downvotes just please share your thoughts and discuss.  I will also admit that I come from a high school background so that may color my opinions.

High school is a cultural coming of age ritual rather than a place for learning.

Grades, as they are now used, are a means for student compliance.  They are not really used to judge how well material has been learned.  My argument for this is simple.  If, on the first day of class, you told all your students that they were all going to get an A no matter what, what percent of students would do anything for your class?

I can honestly say that the majority of my students really don't care about what I teach.  The best that I have been able to do is capture their attention with a little edutainment.  When the gimmicks are all gone and its time to do serious work I lose them again.

At most three to five percent of my students really care about learning the material.  The rest just care about their grades.  My ""best"" students want to get A's and many other just want to pass.

It doesn't matter how engaging, interesting or relevant I try to make my material.

At the end of the day, students go through a social ritual and once they graduate they are now ""adults.""  This is just a sophisticated and time consuming social ritual that is very similar to those that primitive societies use to establish man or womanhood.

I am not making a value judgment here.  This can be good or bad.  And this is also not to say that learning doesn't happen at the high school level.  Rather, those who DO want to learn usually have the opportunity to do so.  There are AP and Honors classes.  But I would argue that these classes make up a tiny minority of the students in the schools.

Schools with highly motivated upper middle class students are all just jumping through elaborate hoops so that they get good careers.  Again, they are less interested in a quality education than they are in grades and GPA so they can be accepted into prestigious universities.

Which brings me to the topic of grades themselves.  I don't like them.  I feel like my job as a teacher is to teach and educate.  However, grading is a bureaucratic   sorting mechanism.  I am aiding in the administrative ranking of students.  Is grading even good for students?  Even higher education struggles with grade inflation.  Truth be told, grading is a scam.

I won't lie, I am an agent of the school system, so, working in the system and trying to preserve my job, I make use of grading to get student compliance.  But I don't pretend like those grades are real.  And I don't think having students attend summer school or retaking my class the next year is beneficial for them.

Perhaps if the system had some consistency then, yes, failing students makes sense so that they will learn their lesson.

But everywhere I've worked, my most problematic students have reacted in the same way to threats of failure.  They tell me they've done the same thing in all their classes and passed anyway.

Sorry about the long response, but really, I make sure I don't fail anyone unless that person is a no show, has literally done ZERO work all year and is also failing other classes.  Why fight the culture?"
highschoolteachers,"I taught EL in a charter in a poor area of the city. It was a high school. Many of the students were new to the country. They were legitimately concerned about how to graduate before they aged out. We had 18 year olds sign themselves out of beginning level EL classes and put themselves in American Literature and then fail. We tried to talk them out of it, but there was a small portion of students who would do it every year. The worst was when we had students under 18 get their parents on board for this plan. 

At the same time, there were so many parents who were grateful for our educational programs, and did not see the EL program as an obstacle, but rather as a benefit."
highschoolteachers,"I teach middle school humanities and Japanese, and my principal asked me to teach 6th grade English literature.

Hadn’t studied it since high school but sure, I read a lot of books how hard can it be? Or so I thought

There are so many different aspects of the English curriculum that I had no idea about and no good ideas on how to teach it. I relied a lot on my department members to ask for advice - I lucked out with some great co-teachers and we shared in the planning

I did Bridge to Terabithia first with focus on the themes. When they asked me why the hippy teacher was looked down or why Jesse’s dad wouldn’t just let him enjoy art... we went down a rabbit hole of counterculture and gender stereotypes and it felt like social studies again XD"
highschoolteachers,"No, we're under a freeze in high school, as well.  3 people are leaving my department this year and my AP was hoping to hire a student teacher that has been with us since September to replace one of them. At the moment, it's a no go."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I wanted to teach middle school originally because I'm small and I was afraid the older kids would be bigger than I am. 

I was placed in a high school for student teaching and surprisingly, liked it.  

I'm recently  k-12 ESL certified and I loved doing pull out with little people. I was also a 3rd grade assistant while working on my Master's --before student teaching--8 yr olds are fun!

That being said, there isn't enough money for me to voluntarily teach general elementary.

--Walking kids to lunch
--Nose wiping, bathroom in the room
--Parents!
--Out of control children that bite, hit, scratch
--The tattling
All of the mandatory after school activities"
highschoolteachers,"It's a very personal choice and there is no way to know until you get in there. If you're going to be doing a certification program, try to observe both. If you can start subbing, DO IT. I thought I would love middle school, but I hated it with the fire of a thousand suns. I thought I would hate elementary, but it turns out, fourth grade is my sweet spot. I also like high school. It's 11-15 when kids become sociopathic dick heads. Some people love it, some people hate it. There's no way to know until you spend time in the trenches."
highschoolteachers,"Both have their challenges and rewards. I know people who love teaching junior high and do a fantastic job working with teenagers. Not me- I taught 5th grade last year and that's about the highest age I'd want to go.

Some things I like about teaching elementary: most of the kids are sweet, you get to do a lot of ""fun"" things (field day, show and tell, field trips), content is generally easier. You get to teach a lot of basic skills, and it's usually easy to connect to the real world.

Some downsides: depending on what grade you teach, the kids need a lot of help and can't be very independent. If you work with little kids, you'll be tying a lot of shoes; even older kids will need help with directions and staying focused. Also, you may have the same group of kids all day. I teach only ELAR now and had two classes, which felt like an eternity some days. When I taught 3rd grade, I was self-contained and oh boy. Not only did I have to teach all the subjects, but some of those kids wore me out.

That being said...I went to college thinking I would teach high school. I don't remember why I changed my mind, but I love elementary!"
highschoolteachers, I wanna be a teacher as well had some of my classes done for my degree it’s elementary education and I was thinking of doing 4th or 5th just to test the waters eventually I want to move up to middle school and high school I just wanted the experience first mostly bc I am shy but not around little 11 year olds haha
highschoolteachers,"I didn’t read all the comments so I’m not sure if this has been said, but I’m in TX with a huge ELL population right next to the border. 90% of the time when a parent waives services, it’s because they don’t understand what the services are or how it helps both the student and the parents. It’s so critical parent meetings and other positive relationship building events are scheduled to help improve the relationship between the school and the family, and providing resources and all communication in their home language. A lot of parents I don’t hear back from via email are because they don’t understand my email in English. It is frustrating trying to contact parents in my broken attempt at Spanish, or relying on others to facilitate communication, but I can’t fault the family, or the kid, for not understanding what ELL education provides and supports. 

Of course this doesn’t apply to all kids or families - some just flat out say no without any clear reasoning - but, it is important to maintain empathy for second language learners, especially when they enter at the high school level not knowing much English. It’s crazy to me how few districts mandate ELL training and certification for teachers. I taught in SC and had multiple students who could only say “hello” and I was given zero legit training except a booklet with suggested strategies. In TX, I had to pass an exam and take a 2 day course to help me study for the exam. I learned so much more about teaching ELL that is actually applicable in the classroom in 2 days than the 3.5 years I was in SC at a rural school with a large ELL population."
highschoolteachers,"My biggest challenge is lack of participation. I teach high school ESL. I did online meetings at pre scheduled times 3 days a week for the past 9 weeks. 90% of the time not a soul showed up. The remaining time it was 1 to 2 students max. Only about 30% turned in weekly assignments, even though they were only 10 question multiple choice quizzes about short stories. Quite disheartening."
highschoolteachers,"Every year without fail, in my small school we get 1-2 students whose parents fight to put them into a math class they’re not ready for, and they end up failing miserably. They end up repeating the class and not passing it until their second year in high school. If they had just taken the class they should have the first year, then by the end of year 2 they’d be in the same place but with two credits instead of one. So frustrating."
highschoolteachers,"First, Congratulations!

Second, I recommend the Geronimo Stilton series, if you don't already have them. They're a blend of picture &amp; chapter book with tons of bright illustrations and creative design. I don't teach elementary (high school teacher), but my son adored these  from 1st through 5th grade. We had the entire series at home and he read them over and over."
highschoolteachers,"Agree on mask mandate and glad i also got for first shot. I not keen on full reopening specially losding tje madk mandate and capacity limit. I do high school sped its about 50/50 and overall the kids  actually doing better then those in  class . That may not be true for little ones though. 

Imy experince suggests that online learning can  been viable alternative during the pandemic and for some long term.  I do see trend that it's the students who were doing better pre pandemic who are the one's whose parents are willing/able to keep them safe at home. 

Classes remain onlime with kids in room ( and other rooms) which is safer and saner then tryimg to lives stream a class  which would imo looses  the virtual learners. I suspect that data for the in house onlime learner model will not show much if any gap versus the live stream model which i suspect scews toward online failures 

We had only 3 weeks of  synchronous live  virtual so while it was going well its not long enough to make conlusion one way or another. The online asynchorpus from the spring was a badly designed flop

Imo the now 1000 cases in  my district (and rising) alone is an unacceptable cost for  preventing any potential  educational losses  specially since  teachers have died and probaly community members too though without any real contract tracing cant prove it 

Real contract tracing periodic testing and priority vaccines would have saved lives and I am glad that unions in other states are pushing for at least thst"
highschoolteachers,"I work at a high school, and most teachers call each other by last names when we're in front of students (title is used some of the time).  First names are for emergencies or in more casual/non-student settings.  Also, students don't really know our first names, so it can be confusing for them.

I do get the occasional student that want to see what happens when they use my first name.  I respond with their title and last name, and they are usually not a fan."
highschoolteachers,"Oh yeah, I feel this deeply. It goes further back than the pandemic for me. My first year I had high school honors, which I am fully aware is the dream job. But my strength as a teacher always was that I was entertaining. Kids liked being in my class because I'd make lessons that were usually pretty enjoyable. 

I got a new job at a new school a few years ago and everything changed. My curriculum was written for me without any of my input and daily lessons were drill and kill boring. I liked to start classes with a funny Office clip or article or YouTube video and asking students to make a connection to what we were talking about in class. When I told my new supervisors that I liked to do this you'd have thought I said ""I like to start my class with some hardcore pornography."" Absolutely no straying from drill and kill. Ok then. .

Fast forward to this year when the circumstances further limit creativity and I fully surrendered. Here is your worksheet, here are the exact answers, you have the next 40 minutes to work (or more realistically turn your camera off and walk away). I'm curious if schools realize they are assuming the role of Dementor, sucking the joy from all who come into contact with it."
highschoolteachers,"I heard somewhere that teachers who refused to come back to work in Texas were having their licenses taken away. Is that true? Also, I'm listening to this podcast called ""Odessa"" about Odessa high school and the pandemic, brilliant!"
highschoolteachers,"Student came in to my high school class tweaking out on hard drugs. We were watching him escalate as we tried to quickly get help from admins and the school resource officer without making him more paranoid and aggressive. 

Did he have a weapon? Was he about to snap and use it? 

He fled the building and was hiding among cars in the lot while responders came. 

I am ALWAYS afraid of school shooting situations and physical harm in the building/classroom.

Where do I teach? Your Normal School System. I feel like anywhere is a tinder box these days.

 I teach everyday with my two eyes wide open and my doors locked. I spend a lot of time talking to and explains to my students how we all need to be alert. Many truly get it and appreciate it because they too are very concerned! I keep myself and my students safe #1."
highschoolteachers,"It happened to me when I covered an 8th grade class, I was asked to cover the class because the teacher was doing high school registration. I had taught them in 6th so no problem I set up a Kahoot and put them in  pairs. Never had an inappropriate name before didn’t notice until they came on the leaderboard, Norfolk n chance!!!"
highschoolteachers,"Do you have any other career interests that deal with math? Accounting? Engineering? Or do you see yourself teaching in another subject area or grade level? Are you interested in the medical field at all? Nursing? What about anything technology/computer related?

I'm just throwing out some ideas. I know how limiting it can feel to be trained as an educator and not really seeing life beyond the classroom. A friend of mine taught math for several years and decided he needed a career change. He took an electrical engineering course at the local community college and really enjoyed it, then applied and was accepted to an engineering master's program at a university with a great engineering program. He's now making *way* more money and is much happier. 

I'm a high school English teacher and have been for 19 years. I was on the verge of resigning back in November because I'm just so burnt out. I really don't have many other options and I want to stay in the system to get my retirement and where I live there just isn't much else I could do and still earn the same salary and benefits. So, I'm moving to middle school next year! It's still ELA, but it's going to be enough of a change that I'm actually excited about it."
highschoolteachers,"I said this to a colleague the other day. I’m disturbed by the fact we have just accepted that school isn’t about learning instead it’s some sort of weird daycare/ social services provider. I think it’s great to give support to kids who need it but, a high school should not be the answer to physical, emotional, and psychic help. That’s not something to celebrate, we’re not these kids families, I know we all love our students but I’m not their parent or guardian. School should not be the dispensary of all these services that we’ve dumped on teachers."
highschoolteachers,"My school went to a block schedule with A and B days and out of 8 periods, I have one planning. We have 4 periods a day, plus our advisory. I would have had NO planning on A days, but they get a high school teacher to cover our advisory on those days since they all somehow get atleast 90 minutes of planning every day. It's messed up."
highschoolteachers,"Contact the parents and tell them what he's been doing.  Unless they are Puritans you aren't going to say anything shocking to them. If they are decent parents, they will straighten that dumbass behavior themselves. If not, then write the kid up for sexually harassing the class the next time he does it.

Sometimes the wording can sting the offender.  I had a high school kid who kept ""cup checking"" some of his friends. I knew what he was doing, but his referral stated that he ""keeps touching the genitals of other males in class without consent."""
highschoolteachers,"Hi! This may not apply to your situation, depending on your students’ demographics, but I just attended a training by Dr. Hollie on Culturally Responsive Teaching. They format their trainings to model what responsive teaching looks like. I went into the (zoom) training rolling my eyes and came out smiling and inspired. Lots of movement, music, and interactive activities. We watched a video of a high school English teacher demonstrating how he uses the strategies in his classroom. I can’t find the video anywhere online but Dr. Hollie’s website is worth looking at! https://www.culturallyresponsive.org 

I got the kindle edition of one of his books and it has so many ideas for instructional strategies that will liven up any classroom, not just kids from marginalized cultures. 

And the biggest take away I had was to change my teaching mindset to always showing “outrageous love.” It sounds cheesy I know, but it was a beautiful thing to learn about and very inspiring."
highschoolteachers,"I got ghosted after an interview with MY FORMER ENGLISH TEACHER, who had become a principal and was hiring staff. She even recognized me from high school and hugged me on the way out, saying ""I'll call you by the end of the week!"" 

Nada. So disappointing."
highschoolteachers,"Just read this sub for awhile and you'll get all your questions answered, lol. 

I teach high school juniors and seniors. I've had a chair thrown at me. Kid was back in class the next day. We had a parent show up after school one day with a gun, waving it around in the bus loop in front of the school (right in front of my classroom). She was going to shoot a kid that her precious was in a fight with. I had a kid one year who would not sit down. Ever. He wandered around class antagonizing everyone, singing, dancing, swearing, yelling, cussing me out. Nobody in that 29 student class could get any work done and I couldn't teach. I was a newish teacher, but I knew the kid was a problem when the 30-year veteran teacher whom everyone in the school respected said he didn't know what to do with this kid. Ruined one whole class period every day for a solid year. 

That's a small selection of individual stories involving kids. There are problem kids. But they could be dealt with if admin would remove them or allow you to give them consequences. That doesn't happen though, in many schools. 

In many schools, students are allowed to turn in work whenever they want, in whatever order, sometimes even 2 or 3 quarters late, after grades have been in for months. Sucks to be you; you have to grade it all, whenever they choose to turn it in. They love to turn in piles of crap right before the end of the quarter, leaving you to spend your whole weekend/vacation sorting through a bunch of illegible nonsense to grade. They and their parents love to come up with reasons why it's your fault they didn't get their work done on time, or at all, and they love to take those made-up reasons to admin. who, inexplicably tend to believe them.

You may get called out or ""encouraged"" to ""find a way"" for failing students to pass, wink, wink; which involves either compromising your integrity or wasting more of your time coming up with ""extra credit"" for students who didn't do any of the original work you assigned. It's all about grades and pass/graduation rates, at the expense of actual learning. This becomes frustrating and demoralizing very quickly.

Then there's the daily nonsense that involves redundant bullshit paperwork, data, documentation, filling out endless IEP and 504 plans, calls and emails to parents, meetings, trainings and covering other classes that eats up all your plan time. So you have to plan on Sundays. Not to mention having no time to grade, so you have to do that every night at home, or figure out ways not to grade. It comes down to a decision to either have no work-life balance or cut corners. That decision is painful.

There's grade inflation, ridiculous expectations, crazy helicopter parents, standards, rigor, ensuring they pass, long hours, low pay and lack of respect from everyone. Everyone thinks you're lazy because you ""only work half a day for half the year"". If only they knew. If only everyone had to do this job for a year before becoming parents, LOL."
highschoolteachers,Haha school nurses. My 2300 person high school shares a single school nurse with another similarly sized high school.
highschoolteachers,"See this is why I like High school, I can just call them unamerican garbage people who aren't welcome in my class if they're racist in high school."
highschoolteachers,"I've been explaining to people the way the risk calculating is different for teachers. 

Like, any small risk of injury or death a parent faces sending their kid out, is multiplied by hundreds for elementary and thousands for high school teachers. We just get to know SO many more kids than they do.

I point out that parents all let their kids drive and ride in cars because they see the risk as acceptable (not saying it isn't, this isn't a judgement), but every hs teacher I know who has taught for at least a decade has known kids who died in a car crash. So, when people say the risk to students is small, we see the risk that we will know a student impacted has a thousand fold multiplier."
highschoolteachers,"So what changed that you no longer think of your colleagues as friends?

I've been 17 years in the same high school. I like my colleagues for the most part, and we socialize (well, at least we did before the pandemic) at times, but for the most part I try to separate work life from home life.

And even if you get less satisfaction because of a lack of meaningful interaction with your fellow teachers, there's still plenty of satisfaction derived from relationships with students and helping them to grow and maximize their education.

I suspect you're right about lots of things changing. Between the fallout from the pandemic, the move toward Customer Service in education, and feeling like you have to be politically correct all the time, our jobs, and teaching in general, will not be the same in the future. That to me is a bigger issue than how you interact with your colleagues, and one we all have to wrestle with."
highschoolteachers,Our district trained the school nurses and just vaccinated the teachers at the high school.
highschoolteachers,"that is the dream seriously haha 
but some teachers really love charter schools at least the teachers at my high school did and are still there"
highschoolteachers,"I like getting up after the sun rises
I like skipping the commute in rush hour traffic
I like having time to eat breakfast and lunch.
I'm happy that I can use the restroom when I need to.
I don't miss dodging school busses
I don't miss my gas bill

I enjoy teaching without dealing with clowns
I am happy I am not interrupted by random announcements and requests to go to the restroom.
I am thrilled to avoid dealing with dress code, cell phone, and tardy issues.

I never thought I'd say this, but I like working in sweats

I got the vaccine because I knew once it was offered, they'd send us f2f.

I don't have travel to plans. 

In person students will have the equivalent of 2 weeks in class. I will also be teaching virtual students. No one can go to the restroom during class change. We can't stand still next to students to help. We are still pulling them for testing. No paper, so everything is still online. They are in high school , but everything but sports! is pretty still a no go,

I don't want to go back.

I've never claimed to be noble."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I told my kids today, “the last students I sent on spring break, I never saw them again.” I was student teaching in a middle school a year ago. Our last day, March 13, was the day we sent them off for spring break. My internship was canceled thanks to COVID, and I never saw those students again.

One of my students today remarked that I told the class I loved them - I show my love in different ways, but I usually don’t say “I love you all.” But I did today. 

How spring break ended last year is why I told today’s students I love them and I’ll miss them - because I didn’t cherish that moment a year ago, not thinking I would need to. 

I’d give anything to see all those squirming 6th grade faces again."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly it’s not just middle school. I’m supposed to teach Number the Stars to my 4th grades who should be at an end of year INSTRUCTIONAL S. This book is a U and most of them are reading at an average independent O... there’s some consonants between these vowels.

Also I read the odyssey in 9th grade in high school and Chaucer in ap English senior year. Shakespeare every year. I would look elsewhere."
highschoolteachers,"Worth thinking about how many girls go through their first period at school completely unprepared. And how many period accidents happen during school. And yet most guys are totally unaware throughout all of their high school career. 

This sort of thing happens. Teachers are pretty good at being discrete."
highschoolteachers,Okay. Thats great. This saves a lot of time. I don’t know who told me that. I think it was my high school guidance counselor.
highschoolteachers,Thank you. My high school guidance counselor mentioned it a couple of years ago. But it was 3 years ago so I probably misremembered
highschoolteachers,"Trust me, you do not need to study. I’m by no means gifted and took the high school praxis equivalent of your test. I scored poorly on half of the subjects and passed with a 185. Either they’re curving ridiculously, or you don’t even need a high score. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Hi! 
Thanks for your response. Yes, I have divided my approach in 3 steps. 

Step 1 involves what you mentioned where I reach out to high schools and propose my idea. I have already reached out to some school superintendents, presidents, and dean's.

Step 2 involves raising awareness and gaining more support outside the people contacted. I am posting on here, teacher facebook groups, school groups, and pretty much anywhere I can that has some traffic of teachers and professors. I also made a quick 10minute video explaining the entire project and these steps I'm listing here. The purpose of this step is to gain more momentum and support on the idea so that schools can see this is something that will benefit schools and communities. 

Step 3 is broadening the high school hands-on CPR requirement to colleges and universities along with the same proposed incentive. I have already contacted some of these also."
highschoolteachers,"For high school, focus on content; the pedagogy is geared towards K-6. You’ll likely find that the years of “teacher skill” classes could’ve been crammed into one class as most just aren’t practical in high school outside of your evaluations. But definitely check your state’s requirements to see what they require."
highschoolteachers,"I have some straw polls also.

Do you support grade incentives for students (high school, college, and university) who advance their CPR education?: [https://www.strawpoll.me/42781165](https://www.strawpoll.me/42781165)

Do you think hands-on CPR courses should be a graduation requirement for High schools?: [https://www.strawpoll.me/42781173](https://www.strawpoll.me/42781173)

Do you think hands-on CPR courses should be a graduation requirement for College and Universities?: [https://www.strawpoll.me/42781180](https://www.strawpoll.me/42781180)"
highschoolteachers,"Um....""school"" is the teacher's job, yes, but assisting with that responsibility with your kid is YOUR job. I worked all through high school to supplement my parent's shitty wages and they still managed to get on my ass about school- because with it I could go to college or something and do BETTER than them. And I did. I had a lot of help along the way from teachers poking their nose in where (at the time) it was really almost intrusive.

But I reciprocated that interest with trying and effort. And when I didn't I got a boot up the ass from my parents. This was in the 1990s- computers were barely a thing, so research and writing were all done the hard way. I turned in a few papers from a typewriter at home because I couldn't stay after school in the lab to type. 

I'm also a parent now, and working full time, and trying to herd 4 kids through school at various levels, along with having finished my Masters's degree last month. I still manage to find time to log into their school a few times a week to try to avoid the WTF moments when mids and quarter-end. It's kind of my job."
highschoolteachers,"Had one when I was in high school. Naturally, every police officer in the county came to the school, along with the local SWAT team to scope it out.

Turned out that a group of boys called it in, knowing the above would happen. They then used the opportunity to try and rob a bank."
highschoolteachers,"This. I’m tired of the demands and expectations put on teachers regarding students progress in class, especially at the high school level.  Like I have to time to reach out to 150 sets of parents to tell them everyone a kid misses an assignment? There aren’t enough hours in the day. We’re two months into school and you haven’t even bothered to check your kids grades or their progress class? You are their parent after all... yet, it’s somehow my fault and a dereliction of duty on my part. Nah, I don’t think so."
highschoolteachers,"I can relate, at my middle school it has always been so that students start language in the 8th grade, meaning we’ve only ever had one of each teacher (when really we should have at least another PT Spanish teacher). 

Well this year they decided to start language in the 7th grade, but they didn’t see the need to hire more staff to cover the literal extra 150+ students per language. So now I teach 350 students by myself by meeting with them every other day instead of every day. It has been the worst year of my career, and if it weren’t for the fact that one of the high school teachers is resining, giving me the chance to move up there, I would be looking for other employment this summer.

I’m usually pretty resigned to the fact that languages are not a priority class, but the way we have been treated this year is just beyond ridiculous."
highschoolteachers,"My school has had over 50 student cases. Most high schools in the area are close to or over 100 by now (we opened in August for anyone who opted to come back). We only quarantine students if they sit within 6 feet of a positive case by seating charts so this hasn't closed down any classrooms or schools, just sent some kids home. Masks required, distancing not possible. I provided my own purifier with HEPA filter."
highschoolteachers,"Most of my students who have had it are on the remote schedule. I can't speak for younger kids, but my high school students don't seem to be doing much not to get it. That's a big reason why I refused to teach in person until vaccinated."
highschoolteachers,"I don't intend to have children and I'm already expecting to get crap from parents for it. Okay, I've never raised a child but how many child psychology and education psychology classes did you take? 

Also for looking so young because people love to tell me ""You teach at a high school? You look like you're in high school."""
highschoolteachers,"I have a kid and I agree with them. I feel for parents who have elementary kids right now but I’m a lot less forgiving on high school parents. Those who have communicated they have done a lot to motivate their kids also have my empathy. 

Those who don’t do shit? Nope. Johnny hasn’t done anything from 8am-3pm? Guess what he should be doing weekends or weekdays once you get home? Work. 

I talked to my mom about this and she was all about the “you need to give parents grace”. I do, but I also asked my mom if I hadn’t done shit all day what would have happened. You best believe I wouldn’t be watching TV, have a smart phone, have any electronics, or be out with friends. 

There is giving grace and then there is giving people an out. I give grace to my student who is struggling because she’s so Immunocompromised she can’t leave the house and had health issues before the pandemic. The kid that ignores my direction of what the assignment is, refuses to meet with me one on one, and parent tells me they don’t want to work so they can’t force their kid? Maybe they don’t get as much grace. I teach 15 year olds so they should be able to do some work throughout the day or on the weekend."
highschoolteachers,"Same. Even when I was in high school, our senior social studies had a unit on ""adulting"" like how to rent an apartment, do taxes, set up a bank account, apply for a job, etc. I even vaguely remember role playing phone calls to set up appointments!"
highschoolteachers,Also had one in high school. The problem tho was the threat was written on the bathroom wall saying the time the alleged bomb would go off. The administration didn’t evacuate the school until 5 MINUTES BEFORE the alleged bomb was supposed to go off. We gave them a lot of flak for that. They also put us in the football stadium which was maybeeeeeeeeeee 500 feet from the building?. It turned out to be fake (duh) and the person who wrote the threat was a redneck dumbass who had been left back a year or two and was heckin racist (called a black girl the n word to HER FACE and admin did nothing).
highschoolteachers,"We had one when I was in high school. And they moved us to the student parking lot which was across the street, and ended up losing a majority of the students when everyone got in their cars and drove away. Had to call parents and say it was an early dismissal. Huge fiasco."
highschoolteachers,"Parents are working.. these are high school students. The parents have to work, and they leave them home. Some of them have been babysitting their siblings the whole time (it's usually a small number, 1-2 per class).

Forcing them back in May changes very little for the majority of my students."
highschoolteachers,"Its because the demographic in the classroom is usually different to the one presented online. Online, its a bunch of college students with hindsight. In the real world, high school students wont care till they realize they’re fucked later on."
highschoolteachers,"When I was a student, my high school classes regularly had 50 students."
highschoolteachers,"I’m a freshman in high school, there is a chance you’re a bad teacher but I doubt it cause that’s just how kids act. 

My friends sometimes act like that only to get a reaction from others/make work easier. 
In my cases, 70 percent of the time they are over exaggerating or just trying to be funny.

5 seconds after they leave the class they won’t think about what they said, so you should probably do the same."
highschoolteachers,"That's the same way I felt about my typing course, back in high school"
highschoolteachers,"Bad jobs will always be available. Take the good job, make connections and keep in touch. 

Sub all the time. 

If it’s a high school job, supplement your income by prepping kids for the SAT. This is a super valuable skill that high schools live in teachers."
highschoolteachers,"Okay young people complain about not learning anything but ""the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell"" in high school and then treat their teachers like this when they try to teach them something else???"
highschoolteachers,"Ontario does a similar thing with academic/university and applied streams. Honours and AP courses serve a similar role in the US to the university stream. Unfortunately at least when I was in high school in Ontario I felt a ton of pressure to stay away from applied stuff even if I would have liked it, because I was “smart” and therefore was 100% going to university in the eyes of everyone, especially the guidance counsellors, and therefore couldn’t fit much stuff which didn’t help that process into my schedule. In retrospect I might have been way happier if I’d just taken the shop classes instead of one or two of the science courses where I already knew most of the content from my own reading, got into a trade, made some money, and maybe come back for the university later when I had figured my shit out a bit better."
highschoolteachers,"Ridiculous. It’s all about CYA and passing the buck. No one wants to get sued and no one wants to deal with the consequences, so kids get passed along, from elementary all throughout high school, and then they are on their own and all of a sudden all these touchy-feely truth circling, mindfulness preaching do gooders don’t give a shit about them anymore, because they are now graduated. 

Our schools do a terrible job of preparing students for the dog-eat-dog world that is our society.

I taught in Europe and it’s the opposite: schools are hard, teachers are brutally honest and kids are often put in their own tier, based on (perceived) intelligence, no extra help, no retakes, nothing, if your cat died the night before, you’re still taking that test and a no show is a 0. But then outside of school, society is nowhere near as hard as ours, with health care, vacation time, strong unions, etc."
highschoolteachers,"Graphic tablets like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HQDN7W6/ref=cm_sw_r_em_api_glt_fabc_3WW8QY3Z4Q7BRTN75RN1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) are a great alternative to smart boards/doc cams. They’re really great for writing on your computer screen (particularly when you’re teaching synchronous remote and in person kids). It probably would take some a bit to get used to but I’m loving mine for teaching high school science. 

I also prefer them over doc cams because I’m left handed so my hand blocks what I’m writing on camera."
highschoolteachers,"I actually support that concept. I can see a fast completion rate. Twenty credits especially eliminated if students didn't need to complete physical education classes. Health classes in California are pointless or should have curriculum joined with life science courses as they are in college.  When I left high school I was already to be accepted into the university system and had to eliminate 10 extra credits just by being a teacher's assistant to graduate. 

I was just commenting that I believe at least the system in California promotes the university path too much. Part of this is to increase the number of graduates of this kind in our region, most of whom have the better work opportunities in coastal cities and don't remain. It's also to keep the overly expensive university system in the state profitable for its wealthy trustees and high costs after the federal government stopped subsidizing it under the Reagan administration. 

I can see high schools offering much more in vocational programs instead of just more Engli"
highschoolteachers,"I always cringe when my former high school classmates complain about the lack of teaching ""useful skills"" in their school, because we went to a large high school with a TON of elective options! Like, there were so many cool options I was pissed that we didn't have enough elective periods for me to take all of the classes that interested me, lol. Plenty of these electives were ""practical"" skills that people insist should be mandatory in schools. Autoshop, woodshop, cooking, sewing, agriculture and business classes, and more.

I'm down for having these classes as electives, but having them all required is impractical. And lets be real, if these classes were mandatory there would be plenty of people arguing that they're useless, lol"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;  none of them can ever tell us what part of the curriculum we should cut to make room.

Most of it.

In high school I took biology, chemistry, alegebra, geometry, and a bunch of other classes.

10 years later...

I have never needed to know how a cell works. I have never needed to know how to balance a chemical equation. I have never needed to factor something. I have never had to differentiate between different triangles.

Holy shit we spent like 2 months in biology studying Lorenzo's Oil. I HAVE NEVER HAD A MOMENT IN MY LIFE REQUIRE ME TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT MYELIN SHEATHS BUT JESUS CHRIST I SPENT WEEKS LEARNING ABOUT THEM. 

80% of my time in high school was a complete waste of time.

Most of school is absolutely useless."
highschoolteachers,"It’s this late in the year and you have senior students and you aren’t aware of their post high school plans 🤨 

If you would have explained the nursing connection to your course, maybe she would have been interested.."
highschoolteachers,"I should have clarified what I meant. After the 10th(ish) grade, they have their high school diploma. Those that want to go to college have to attend what we would call the 11th and 12th grades. Those that wish to study a vocation, spend their 11th and 12th grades doing that. Yes, in most states kids can drop out at 16. But they have no diploma unless they take and pass the GED, which is a lot harder than most realize. In Europe, at 16, you get your diploma and can start working, but without the 11th and 12th grade, one can’t go to college."
highschoolteachers,"Exactly. I have people on facebook from high school that say the exact same shit. While I was in High School I got about a semester of college credits and completed an A+ computer repair certification. And I wasn't even a great student, I got denied to several colleges because I had a 2.1. I just took advantage of what was offered when I was there. If anything, I feel bad because I didn't do enough.

It's not my fault, or the education system's fault they chose to take ""Sci-fi and Fantasy"" for their lit requirements and ""Zoology"" for science, then PE for every elective. It's theirs."
highschoolteachers,"The last week of official class before finals, I normally (not this year) have ""practical skills week"" where we learn things like running a budget, reading a clock, tying survival knots, reading a compass, signing their name, and operating the bus schedule. The kids normally really dig it.

I teach high school English. It is low stress for them while they study for finals, so that may be it."
highschoolteachers,"A lot of ""those kids"" in my classes have convinced themselves that school offers no benefit to their life. Sadly, the truth is doing work now in high school is the single best way to improve their quality of life(and income) down the road. It's also the easiest way. Much easier than working your way from the ground up. I do think vocational school would be a good option for many but not all. They're not bad people and can be productive members of society but they need to break out of that mentally and appreciate delayed gratification."
highschoolteachers,"In many ways, we don’t learn things until we need to, which is fine. Why do we act like once we leave high school, all learning stops? If you feel you don’t know how to do something as an adult, GO LEARN IT. There are tons of free resources online and at your local library. Why are we blaming schools for your lack of effort as an adult?"
highschoolteachers,"Not pregnant but a 5ish months pregnant girl I went to high school with, who’s a nurse, posted about getting her COVID vaccine the other day. I was surprised but figured she would know if it’s a problem."
highschoolteachers,"Idk why everyone says this.  In my high school, we DID have a class called Financial Literacy which covered taxes and income and all that."
highschoolteachers,This is in reference to working as an adult while you go to high school because you decided you did not need it originally. Its about an order of magnitude easier.
highschoolteachers,"Teaching high school, every app added is another chunk of students who drop off and decide not to navigate to yet another link. It literally hurts engagement. The most engaging thing I can do is just Zoom chat tbh"
highschoolteachers,"If they drop out, they don’t have a diploma. In many European countries, their high school diploma is given after what we would call the 10th grade (or around that). Students that wish to further their studies and attend college complete the 11th and 12th grade. Instead of a vocational high school, where students switch between their shop and academics, the 11th and 12th grade is spent mainly on shop, for those that wish to learn a vocation. Students that do not want to continue their education do not have to attend anything else, and already have a degree."
highschoolteachers,Yeah I get that from students all the time. They tell me they could never deal with high school students. I appreciate that they are so self aware haha
highschoolteachers,Yep. Normal - especially high school. But they usually only get out of school suspension if it’s for a violent reason. Otherwise it’s in-school suspension. I never knew why they were suspended but knew it would have to be pretty bad to get out of school suspension.
highschoolteachers,"So...in my school we do have multiple classes that teach that stuff. As well as stocks and business related math. Just pitch it in your district.

Editing to say...some kids are just gonna be like that. Some students will actively seek your out for teaching that kind of stuff.

I was one of the kids that shit on everything in High School. Now I'm cursed to be a high school teacher my whole life. Ya never know what is going on at this kids home to make them like that. It really doesn't have to do with you."
highschoolteachers,"Hey thanks!  I know I can't be spectacular all the time, and honestly some of the stuff I try to teach is painfully boring, but I didn't get I to teaching to make kids suffer.   I was no stellar student in high school myself, but I do my best."
highschoolteachers,"Legends of Learning is from elementary - high school. You select the grades and such. If you have google classroom, integration is super easy. Plus it is 100% free.

As for minecraft, I find all age range loves it. The learning curve is pretty easy."
highschoolteachers,"Oh my.  I’m right there with you. I have some flexibility in my curriculum too. I teach high school and I have a feeling many kids aren’t going to learn these sorts of skills from their parents, so I use nearpod to teach lessons on: job interviews, resumes and work skills, budgeting and planning, finance and debt, etc. 

Most of them glaze over and go back to staring at their phones and a few students chime in with lovely comments such as “I don’t need to get a job, I’m going to be a drug dealer / you tuber / famous athlete / stripper”, etc and/or “I don’t need to know how to budget. I’m going to marry someone rich” 

🙄🙄 yeah good luck with that"
highschoolteachers,"I am honestly shocked that he uses the money to give them a cookout. It is a very important skill for trade workers to measure twice, cut once. You need to check for mistakes before you start wasting materials. It is a skill I know the shop and welding teachers struggle to teach in the high school."
highschoolteachers,"Yes, but rather than them dropping out, their high school diploma is technically done at 16-ish. The ones that don’t want to learn don’t have to go to a vocational school. They can just start to work."
highschoolteachers,"I don't actually know how my parents came to that conclusion, but regardless they are set in stone on that decision. Bad influences, distraction of peers, bullying etc are the reason I've been told. I never questioned their reasoning until now as I was indifferent towards my mode of education, but my brother wanted to stay at local schooling through and through. There is another high school nearby but transport would be an issue."
highschoolteachers,"Lol thanks. I do have one. Don't think my anger is unjustified though, that's the thing. I'm not afraid to voice my opinion either. I've always been the kid in school that sticks up for other people, and I'm never gonna let that change. One of principals prior to when I arrived in high school was convicted of sexual assault and coercion of like 8 different MINORS on and off school grounds. He served there for 11 years before he got caught. What does that tell you about the administration's decision making capabilities?"
highschoolteachers,"Really? It's made me more liberal. Maybe because I'm in a k-8 school, but I see how the world system has absolutely failed the kids and to drive extent, their parents. Like we have kids, that if we had a regular youth counselor, could be saved and given a chance. I started working in 98 and our youth counselor came in 3 times a week, now we get a social worker 1/2 day every two weeks and a counselor on an opposite bi-weekly schedule. I've been able to predict what was going to happen to many of these kids going to high school, without intervention, and lo and behold it goes to crap for them. I've seen the effects of late stage capitalism on families and how we have so many without any hope. It's made me way more in favor of social programming and help."
highschoolteachers,One thing that I think will come out of this pandemic will be more options for schooling.  I would like to see a hybrid in-person/asynchronous 2/3 split become a common option.  My most successful semester in college was the spring of my sophomore year where I was on campus from 8-3 Tuesday and Thursday taking 3 classes and at home MWF taking three online classes.  I think I would've done well with that system in high school.
highschoolteachers,"And if your taxes ARE that difficult, that's what accountants are for. And it'll be much more up to date and relevant than whatever you learned in high school."
highschoolteachers,"Uhhh how is a high school teacher not equipped to teach that? Advanced algebra, geometry, and calculus are fine but taxes are just too difficult?"
highschoolteachers,"So dumb.

I teach science and I'm so tired of the push for science, math and literacy. Hell, they are mostly pushing math and literacy and actually slowly doing away with science as an important subject at the lower levels.

&amp;#x200B;

FFS, it's all important. Including foreign language.

It's an absolute joke that there are so many countries where they learn English...just fine...as well as their native language. But we treat learning a foreign language like it's useless.

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty of times I wish I could have learned another language while growing up and not just in middle and high school. And even then I had French in middle school and then Spanish in high school because we didn't have a French teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of ""core courses"" versus ""electives"" is such horse shit. Is their some form of learning happening? Good!"
highschoolteachers,Yep. Try to get 140 high school seniors to upload a PDF of their assignment (using CamScanner or the like). It’s March and we still can’t. I’ve suggested YouTube for help. Still!!!
highschoolteachers,"I had one coworker ask at a virtual faculty meeting why masks are necessary. She claims that her husband told her that he watched One America News and that the CDC had allegedly claimed that wearing masks makes no difference to anyone's health. (I checked the CDC website and found that they haven't said anything of the kind.)

Given how politicized anything about Covid has become, I didn't say anything. I did send the principal a link to the CDC guidelines which continue to stress the importance of social distancing and wearing masks. In the end the principal chose to reiterate district policy which includes a mask mandate.

Some of my colleagues have told me that they won't get vaccinated. I don't understand why and again, to avoid getting political, I have declined to comment on their choices. 

One of our recently elected school board has been sending out tweets. She wants us to reopen our schools as soon as possible for full in person instruction. She has also said that anyone who won't get behind this can find another job.

It's fortunate that the other board members and the superintendent don't agree with her. It's also lucky that we have a union. The union got the district to delay reopening high school until two weeks after all teachers who wanted to be vaccinated were vaccinated (to give our bodies sufficient time to build up antibodies)."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I had a personal finance class in high school, it felt like something I wasn’t ready to figure out.

Yeah, in all fairness, did anyone here care about how to file taxes or figure out a mortgage amortization schedule when they were 15? It's just impossible to relate to. Adults care about it because it affects their everyday lives. Think about the most boring subject someone talks about, and you just walk away because you don't care...that's taxes to a high-schooler.

I'm not sure how you make it relevant. Lots of kids are super into the social media and influencer lifestyle (i.e. ""I wanna be a YouTuber..."") so it might be interesting to walk them through *how* to run your YouTube channel like a business, including where revenue comes from (ads, Patreon, merch, etc), where costs come from (equipment, merch, employees, paid ad campaigns, etc) and help them learn how to budget that. And then out of that, you can be like, ""Oh yeah, don't forget taxes are part of that, and here's how that works.""

Really, the core of learning is engagement, and unless you can find a way to engage someone, they're probably not going to really absorb what you're saying. Now, all that said...that's a TON of work obviously, so if teaching high-schoolers about budgeting isn't your full-time focus, that might be a pretty tall-order to try to hook them."
highschoolteachers,"A finance class covering taxes would have been interesting in my old high school. A rural community with a few “unregulated” businesses (doubt sales tax was paid on stolen oxys).

Trust me, none of my classmates would have cared about some finance class. Most of the materials covered would not be relatable. Parents’ retirement plan? Work until you can go on disability or are eligible for social security/medicare. If they could find work, that is.

Another way teachers are supposed to save the world, I suppose."
highschoolteachers,"Nope. You aren’t being sensitive. Its super weird and very unnerving. I struggle with this same issue and I’m taking a lot of comfort in knowing I’m not the only one going through this. 

I was getting my hair cut last week, and I went to a new stylist. During small talk, she commented on me being a high school teacher by saying “working with teenagers, oof! I hope you don’t end up like one of those women who end up sleeping with their students!” Wtf? How hurtful -  for another adult to imply you might wind up raping a child? What is wrong with people? 

I get the off-hand comments of “that kid is always coming into your room, someone must have a crush!” I can get over that, but I still don’t entirely know what to say. 

To the people saying you’re being sensitive, mostly to the man who said this - I’m sorry, but I really don’t buy it. Try to imagine being at a playground and a parent saying to your face “a man surrounded by a bunch of cute little boys and girls?! Nothing good can come of that!” There’s no way you wouldn’t be offended by a comment like that. "
highschoolteachers,"a lot of early high school was a joke. it didn't teach anything, and it just wasted my time. Of course the AP teachers who knew how to teach were great. but no one wants to waste their life listening to some old bag drone on about irrelevant, outdated information."
highschoolteachers,"I teach at a continuation school.  One of my colleagues asked me what one of our parents would have done after a student dumped water on a computer.    
My response:  My parents would have loved me enough to send me to military school after getting expelled from the  first high school."
highschoolteachers,"I have to be honest I felt my heart beat for a second when I saw this... when I was in high school I had a ancient civilization teacher. She was probably in her 50s and going grey, she had hand tattoos that were simple and really nice, she was a butch lesbian woman and I was in a long term relationship with another girl and was starting considering a career in education. I loved the class, I loved the teacher and I was really feeling pretty good in that class despite my overall low grades. My mental health however in general was poor. I don’t really blame the teacher for her response to how I acted in the class, I look back at how I acted in school in general and cringe. I was undiagnosed with ADHD and had very low self esteem. There was one particular day that must have been hard for her and we had a quiz. We all took the short quiz and turned it in, maybe there were people still taking the quiz, but I know the quiet time had been going on for a while and a conversation started at my table, about a bullshit “jail” at the Sadie hawkens dance that you could only get out of if you proved you brought a date, proved by kiss. I dont remember a whole lot of the details of how it started, but it ended with her yelling at me in particular. She singled me out of my table because of my previous behavior in a loud display in front of my class that ended with her exclaiming that “class is better when you aren’t here!” I was humiliated and heartbroken. I feel so terrible that she said that to me, i skipped her class for at least three days. I was transferred out of her class after word spread around my grade and the principal got wind of it. She sat in on the class a week later and was transferred to another school soon after. But having someone I looked up to say that to me hurt my heart so bad it definitely effected the rest of my discomfort in high school until I transferred to a post secondary education option where I went to a community college for high school credits. 
I never intended to disrespect her. I don’t know your situation, but sometimes those kids are just trying to get attention because they don’t feel seen in other places, my mom worked full time and my dad suffered severe depression, my undiagnosed ADHD gave me low impulse control and some bad judgement. I don’t mean to defend the student you mentioned, i just thought this situation was similar to mine, and that you had the opposite experience as me. "
highschoolteachers,I completed my graduate degree as a full-time student while teaching full-time at a high school and adjuncting at a college. Add a 45 mile one-way commute to that. Anything is possible if you are extremely efficient and have great time management skills. Don't let personal hesitations hold you back if you are 100% committed. 
highschoolteachers,"Oh yeah. I also tease them and because I'm older and smarter, I generally zing those high school kids!"
highschoolteachers,"It's not an injustice... it's just how jobs work. If your boss isnt happy with your performance, or if they think you crossed a line, then that's that, and it isnt personal. hes not being arrested or losing his certification, hes just not working in that particular school anymore. 

The school has already made their decision, I'm afraid students have really no say in getting a teacher hired (especially REhired). If the teacher wants to plead his case to keep his job, then that is between him and the administrative staff to go over in private. But trying to make a big riot over it is only going to make a spectacle, and honestly, could make him seem like even more of a headache if the school district thinks he may have  encouraged such protest. 

If you want to do something nice for the teacher, maybe talk to a counselor at the school to see if they can help pass along a handwritten note where you can tell him how much you appreciate what he did for you academically. Dont try to friend him or contact him online, as that would be inappropriate, but maybe a note passed along by the staff would be possible.

Again, I'm sorry that you're losing a favorite teacher. I know how that feels, as I lost a favorite high school mentor of my own, and was frustrated by how little I could do to help when I was that young. As I said, its not your place to be worried about these things, your only job is to be the best student you can."
highschoolteachers,A history teacher at the high school where I did my student teaching had just started flexible seating. I talked to her about at the end of my semester there. She absolutely loved it.
highschoolteachers,"I am thinking of making a career change to become a high school teacher. I work in auto insurance as an adjuster. The stress is insane with the line of work that I do now. 

As a general question, how stressful is your job on a day to day? Do you feel the fear of being fired at any moment? I ask this because I have really bad anxiety with my current position and I’m just trying to find something I’m better at and enjoy more. 

Edit: changed a word. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes. 3rd year teacher here, it still sucks. That “new car smell” of school is wearing off and it’s just a grind to get the thanksgiving break and holiday season 

And I’m not sure about where you work, but I’ve noticed that THIS year my coworkers are a lot “nicer”. 
    My school is an 80% FARMS high school with about 1400 kids. We mostly hire first year teachers, but in 45 years, no one in my department has ever left except to retire. 
      What I mean is, in a place like mine, nobody is ready to trust you or let you in until you’ve got some experience and put in your time. It’s not fair, in fact it’s downright counterproductive, but I think it’s normal. Plus, when staff morale is low, people usually take it out on new person. So if you’re having a bad time, I’m not surprised. Remember that you just got to make it to thanksgiving, after that it’s a breeze. Then it’s the post-spring break slog to summer. Oh man, SUMMER
"
highschoolteachers,"Be careful with your personal info. Give them the school number.

My first year teaching my cell phone number got out to my students (from the mom of student who was a fellow teacher at the school). I was a 22 yr old teaching high school juniors and seniors. It was bad....real bad. I got text messages ALL THE TIME. 
Drunk at a party? Text Ms. Albie_Ruth
Breaking up with a SO? SURE....text your teacher
🙄🙄🙄
Strangely, I received ZERO texts about school/school work. Thankfully, texting pictures wasn't a thing. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt;kids are shitty and it takes a huge toll

This! Can't say this enough, two days ago high school student (private school) told me ""My fees pay your salary so that makes me your boss"" totally caught me off guard"
highschoolteachers,"The issue about emails though is sometimes that might be misunderstood. Though phone calls  are fine.  You mentioned behavior issues, and iep/504 meeting would be another time for a one-one mtgs though that is normal scheduled by the district.  Most high school students should be able to schedule meeting with teachers them selves. Though these are lots of helicopter parents these days.   Though not at my preschool! Well at least not that I know off. I remember 2 semester ago we had a ice cream party (at a community park center) and the kids were playing on a play structure, no parents were watching, thier was no gate on one side which open directly to the road. A kid could off defiantly ran right into the road if they had a reason to, but they didn’t.   "
highschoolteachers,"I'd recommend against it because you're probably romanticizing what the job actually is. And that's not your fault, since no one - from high school teaching cadets to the college of education at any school in the US - is accurately portraying what being a teacher these days is like.

It's a lot of paperwork, teaching to a meaningless test, dealing with apathy from students and parents, being put under scrutiny, etc. A great deal of our time is spent doing things that aren't teaching, grading, or planning... which in my opinion is a mistake that is burning new teachers out quickly.

But again, that's why I don't recommend it. Your mileage may vary, and there are many teachers who are very happy with their careers. I personally can tolerate these things, but getting to that point wasn't easy at all.

So if you have just a mild passing interest in teaching, I'd recommend against it. If you are very interested in teaching, I'd recommend having a backup plan... because there's a 50% chance that you will leave."
highschoolteachers,"Kids who thank me at the end of class.  It is such a small thing, but is such a lovely habit.  I teach high school, so manners aren't always their strong suits.  "
highschoolteachers,"My admin has pushed some PD around ACE, which I give them credit for, but there's no follow through. Now the staff are aware of the extent of trauma in the student population and potential impacts (I assume most already knew) but we have no real training on trauma informed care, and no coordinated plan for handling it... nor do we have a social worker, counselors available for students, etc. It feels very hollow.

I haven't heard of those films, but I will look into them. 

Parents complain about grades when they affect sports and that's about it. I had two parents complain about bullying in the first 2 weeks but they've already given up. This level of violence is very normalized in our community. Parents had similar high school experiences, teach their kids to keep their heads down. "
highschoolteachers,"I started teaching at a private high school in Pasadena, CA right after getting my math PhD. I'm making 72k/year, so 6000/month before tax."
highschoolteachers,"Every Friday, we put our regular curriculum aside and we work on our ""Innovation Projects."" The project can be anything that they want to do that is something they wouldn't normally have the opportunity to do in school. I have students learning new instruments, learning how to draw, use Photoshop, writing blogs, designing robots, learning to use 3d modelling software to print to our 3d printer, learning magic tricks and recording those tricks then uploading to their own YouTube channel, a couple of students are working together to create an electronic music album, etc. There are lots of really great examples of kids pursuing their passions. I'm participating by pledging to learn something new each week with them. They do need to understand that I reserve the right to suspend Innovation Project Friday if I feel they didn't work hard enough on our regular curriculum during the week. It's really incredible watching these kids learn, create and get excited about the stuff they're doing.

By the way...I teach high school computer science.


Edit: feel free to leave them comments! They'd be blown away if they knew someone other than me was reading their posts."
highschoolteachers,"I agree that the fundamental culture has to change.  Where I work now, we've been influenced too much by Western post-modern thought where a teacher using perfectly standard disciplinary techniques is ""forcing their reality"" on students.  It's insidious.  So yes in some respects we can't blame the kids (I'm talking about older students in a remedial/ELL class) but in other respects I have to draw the line somewhere.

In my high school we had a system of student-teacher leadership.  The highest 12% of students in the grade were designated as ""prefects"" who were allowed to give demerits (giving so much as an unjustified demerit was enough to have you stripped of your title).  Too many demerits and you'd have a detention which usually involved helping the office secretaries do some mundane task like making and stapling copies or putting stickers on envelopes to mail out.  Further infractions involved harder and harder tasks like shining shoes, having to get up early and do breakfast check-in, or even helping a janitor during recess.  Each class had a class leader (usually the kid who got the highest grade in the previous week) who was responsible for assisting the teacher with discipline/classroom procedure.  Teachers were also strict (in my opinion much more strict than now) but fair.

Now the strange thing is that as strict as the system was, for the most part we didn't need it.  There wasn't any blatant disrespect of any major rule breaking.  If you did wrong, you were disciplined and you were expected to learn and move on.  I remember getting a detention once because my hair didn't comply with uniform policy.  I said that I didn't get a haircut because I didn't have the money.  For my detention, Principal took me into his office, puts $12 in an envelope and gives it to the secretary, and says that if I help out the office ladies for an hour, I get the money.  He gave me a speech about being more responsible with spending, and to remember to remember to set aside $12 for a haircut next time.  And that's something I've remembered.  To this day I still set aside a bit of money for a haircut every month.  

So we learned to manage our own behavior.  For the most part, we policed themselves, without becoming rats, and held ourselves accountable.  These days this kind of system is almost unthinkable.

I really disagree with the notion that there have to be second, third, and fourth chances and even then you have to take the ""higher road"" and ""be compassionate""."
highschoolteachers,"College faculty here at a small school, but I previously taught at a large school.  I'll try and answer the bullets individually.

1) Yes I do, but I haven't taught freshmen in a few years.  Generally the issues are not academic, I feel like most high schoolers who make it into a college can ""hack it"" academically.  The biggest transitional issue I see is time management.  High schoolers mostly have their day-to-day rigidly structured by a all-day class schedule, after school activities, and parents.  College day-to-day life requires you create your own structure and follow through with it.  

2) Yes and no.  Community college can be a transition period in which the above time management issue gets worked on in a lower-stakes environment. But I get the sense CC is way less academically rigorous.  In fact, some of the least academically prepared students I have had graduated from a CC that had a ""pipeline agreement"" with the 4-year university I was teaching.  Such an agreement entails a 4-year university automatically accepting graduates from a certain local CC.  I've seen many students coast through a CC degree, then automatically get into a 4-year they are totally unprepared for.

3) I'd say a firm majority are undecided their freshman year, even I they formally have a major on paper.  That's generally not ideal.  The students who show up decided do best and get out earliest. But I feel like in the first two years, most student firmly know what they want to do.  

4) I'd end the pipeline programs like I described.  They send a ton of students into academic experience they are not prepared for.  That or  make CCs involved in such agreements more rigorous.  I'd also invest in more career and vocational education.  A lot of students actively resent the process of getting a liberal arts degree, but do it because there parents told them its the only path to the middle class, which isn't necessarily true. 

5) Males.  It may be counter-intuitive given the gender pay gap, but males lag well behind females in college admission, performance and retention. I don't think there has been enough empirical evidence to demonstrate why this is. "
highschoolteachers,"I use it with high school students. When I, as the teacher, edit the paper I have to look at content, grammar, syntax, spelling, and a few other issues. When a friend looks at a paper he can look at the basic content and the flow of logic in the essay or story. A peer is not bogged down with all of the issues in editing. It is also a rewarding activity for the editor, as he feels like he is being called upon to give an opinion.

highschoolteachers,"In my first junior high school (I'm in France) they had one of the suppervisor (men or women who are looking after the pupils at the refectory, and call paretns when pupils are missing...) in front of the bathroom from the opening of the school until the closure. I found it was not the best situation (even if it was justified), but it's still better than locking the bathroom I guess."
highschoolteachers,"Stamina, cultural literacy, recognition that there are important works of art, literature, etc. that precede you by thousands of years.  The Odyssey is the basis for all Western literature, period.  I wish I'd had that background from high school.  "
highschoolteachers,"I did this AS a high school student and it was a lot of fun (I’ve taught elementary &amp; middle—middle school we had them act out romeo &amp; juliet and it was a blast!) It’s a great lesson. 


the 6th grade also had a greek mythology day where they dressed up as different gods/goddesses and then presented their research on them as them. that was cool!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school theatre, and I think this is a great project. I have students write and perform scenes all the time. It may not work with every group of kids, but if you make scene work an option, you might find a lot of kids respond well to it. Just make sure your rubric is clear. "
highschoolteachers,"TPT is great. If you sign up, get sent an email with a bunch of free/discounted resources. I bought a bunch of English high school bell-ringers that I can use for all of my grades. There is a lot of shit, but there is heaps of great free and cheap stuff too, if you are specific in what you search for. "
highschoolteachers,"Thank you so much sir, I also want to become a high school science teacher. I’ve been searching this sub for just one positive comment to go for a degree in science education and I’ve just found it."
highschoolteachers,"I am 21 yrs old and but I have a lot of education: Associates in Liberal Arts, B.A. in Sociology and in Spanish, and I will be finishing my M.Ed in Curriculum and Instruction this coming year. I also have a decent amount of work experience all considering: I was a research assistant in college, an assistant manager of a retail store, a substitute for a year,  I also volunteered to teach ESL classes at night and volunteered to be a teaching assistant for about a year in high school as one of my electives, and of course this year I am finally teaching as a certified professional. 

This is my first year officially teaching in my own classroom and I always thought I would love being a teacher but I am way too overwhelmed and stressed out every day... the support from my school is very little and I admit that the school district I am in is particularly difficult (85% poverty rate) but it's only mid October and I dread going to school every single morning. I am afraid that I am not cut out to be a teacher, at least not a full time one. I would love to be a substitute or a teaching assistant again but they don't pay as well obviously. I'm worried that the responsibilities and the difficulties that come with teaching public high school are too much for me. 

Is what I'm going through normal for a first year teacher? Should I stay in this field or should I just leave at the end of the summer? The problem I see is that I literally don't know what else I would do, I feel like the only thing I am qualified to do is be a teacher so I don't know where I would go or what I could even do..."
highschoolteachers,"You mean the Praxis?

Just study like fourth grade arithmetic. I have no doubt that those skills are rusty for just about any adult, but surely you are capable of understanding them. Otherwise what was the point of you even graduating high school?"
highschoolteachers,"My high school English teacher told us if we ever wanted to upset the art teacher, we should ask him if he had glitter.

Apparently there were literal gallons of it in the art room when he arrived his first year and he was traumatized by it. "
highschoolteachers,"My friend’s boyfriend did this. He was a high school speech and debate teacher for eight weeks, but had a shitty mentor who ignored him and just generally didn’t seem to care that he was drowning. So one day he just didn’t show up, turned his phone off, and drove to his hometown. I know he had to talk with a union rep or someone similar about getting out of his contract. He’s not allowed to teach in that district anymore, but he applied in a smaller district and they said they’d have no problem hiring him due to that incident. 
Ultimately, he’s still working in call centers, but is SO much happier. "
highschoolteachers,"1. Yes because they're coddled in high school and the (harsh) truth is that once you're outside of high school none of your professors/bosses will care enough about you to just pass you through. Mommy calling them only makes matters worse-not better.
2. It's cheaper, and you can transfer to a 4-year university for your bachelor's. Great option for many students.
3. The more you value school work in high, the more you value an education, the more likely you are to go to university/college.
4. I remember speaking to guidance in college when I changed my major and they told me that roughly 1/3 of students do. It's unreasonable to expect an 18 year old kid to have their entire future planned out.
5. None. You adapt to the world, the world will never adapt to you.
6. Tons, but it's too broad of a question to begin."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah I’m in a high school so my students are generally on the same level. By the time we get to the peer editing phase we’ve already done a ton of other work and there are specific things the kids are told to look for. “I like your intro” wouldn’t fly. 

My students generally appreciate, benefit from, and enjoy peer editing. I’m sorry your situation sucked but I don’t think it’s fair of you to dismiss the entire thing because you had bad experiences with it. "
highschoolteachers,"Bruh, I just want my high school students to be comfortable solving linear equations at this point. Get outta here with your big dreams. "
highschoolteachers,"But isn't unfair to the stronger students? Who won't get the same type of helpful advice that the weaker students are receiving? 

I had to peer review a research argument for one of my classes the other night that sparked this question. The argument I was reviewing was honestly unreadable. There was no research question or thesis statement, the grammar and punctuation was not good, and the overall organization of the argument made it so that I had no idea what my peer was talking about or what he was researching. This put me in an incredibly uncomfortable position, because I had to type up notes and share them with him in class today, but I didn't want to have to tell him that almost every aspect of his paper needed work. So when I typed up my comments, I really put a lot of energy into trying to give him constructive criticism without totally shitting on his paper. It took me about an hour and a half. When we went over the comments today in class, I spent 25 to 30 minutes going through everything I wrote down with him and explaining my thought process. When it was his turn to show me his comments, he had three bulleted points on a page: ""I like your introduction,"" ""Your sources are reliable,"" and ""I was really interested."" Needless to say, I was frustrated that I'd put so much time and effort into trying to help him and got literally nothing helpful or constructive in return. 

Obviously this particular situation is very specific to my own life, but I can't even begin to tell you how many times something similar has happened. From your perspective (as a teacher who is pro peer editing), is this truly fair? And as a follow up question to that, do teachers ever care that students GENERALLY (I know there are exceptions!) really hate peer editing, that we find it awkward and not very helpful?

Thank you for responding to my post, and I hope you know I mean no disrespect by asking these questions. I have a lot of respect for all teachers and just want to understand what goes on in their brains sometimes!

EDIT: I also want to acknowledge that since you teach middle/high school, you could have a totally different experience with your students and the results of the exercise, so please keep in mind that I have no idea if peer editing works well with younger students -- I'm just speaking from my own experience as a junior in college."
highschoolteachers,"The link between success in high school and college has always been weak. Now the value of a college education is in question. I've think students who are interested in professions that don't require advanced physics, math, biology, etc. should be learn how to choose the college courses they can pick up when they need that particular training. "
highschoolteachers,"I didn’t love my middle school placement either but it was a valuable lesson in gritting my teeth and getting through it. I ended up teaching high school, where I felt much more comfortable and generally enjoyed it, but I still would sometimes have a class or a prep or a student that I didn’t like and I was glad I had developed a tough skin and coping mechanisms during a very unenjoyable student teaching placement.

A lot of things are out of your control as an educator. We have administrators or parents or test scores or whatever causing stress every day. It’s a good lesson to learn you can’t control everything but you can control your attitude and how you cope.

Just food for thought!"
highschoolteachers,"I have maintained since I was in high school that if I ever become an arch-villian of the Marvel Comics variety, my weapon of choice is going to be glitter."
highschoolteachers,"I find it very odd that you’re doing peer editing in college. I never did this and see it as well, a waste of time at the college level. My high school students in 9th grade can hardly outline a paper let alone write one at this point in the year. At the college level, this shouldn’t be needed. 

As a high school English teacher, I despise peer editing as well, it’s a hassle to get everyone at the same stage. That being said—once everyone is ready for it I find it beneficial. 

I have student highlight their transitions, their evidence, and their elaboration, and grammatical errors with color coding. This is then passed back to the original writer, and they do a reflection sheet on things they need to adjust. 

This helps my low writers see what a good paper looks like and for my masters to aide the cause before I get a headache that is fueled by laziness and lack of effort. 

I also make my students highlight changes made in their final draft when it is turned in, and have it be stapled to the peer editing. 

I don’t know if this answer will help you, but it’s my rationality. "
highschoolteachers,"Truthfully at the high school level? No. By all means, I reach out requesting parent meetings of students who are failing, behavioral issues, or personal issues impacting school. Those are important and I schedule those myself. 

However, I have 170+ students and I have yet to hear an excuse from a parent as to why an in person meeting is required opposed to phone/email. "
highschoolteachers," BACKGROUND

What grade level do you teach? 9-12

How long have you taught that grade level, and how long have you been teaching overall? --Taught for 5 years, teaching for 7 years

LEGISLATION

Do you think that the ELL students in your school receive adequate resources to aide their education and, if a high level ELL student, aide in the learning of English as a language? If so, what effective programs are in use? If not, what would you like to see implemented? --I work at a ""newcomer"" high school so students who are new to the country can choose to go here because we have a larger ELL department. I believe we receive ""adequate"" resources because of this designation. I think having a ""newcomer"" school is a good strategy because we can give the extra resources needed to those students who would benefit most. We have many co-taught core classes as well as directed immersion classes. I would like to see more ELL co-teaching/co-planning happening at other schools as leaving it up to the teacher to differentiate for native speakers, non-native speakers, as well as student with NO ENGLISH AT ALL is extremely difficult and over burdensome. In the end though, a weighted per pupil funding approach is the only way ELL students will ever be able to receive more than adequate resources to better attain the English language and get on track with their English speaking peers. 

Do you conduct a functional behavioral assessment to aid in the instruction of ESE students? Is having this tool effective? Can you give an example of when this worked for you? -- I have never heard of ESE before.

ETHICS

What kinds of ethics violations have you been aware of during your career?   
And what types of violations do you consider serious vs. light?  
Have you ever felt that you made an ethics violation but did not realize it until afterwards? --I have not been involved in unethical situations personally, but have heard of them happening to others. Some I have been aware of: inappropriate student/teacher relationships (severe), inappropriate teacher conduct/language such as cussing during class or at students, grabbing a student, or being demeaning to a student or coworker (severe or light), unprofessional teacher attire (light). 

STRATEGY

What is an instructional strategy that you have perfected and couldn’t teach without? --Attention grabbers - I use 1, 2, 3 and it helps transitioning tremendously.   
What is a strategy that a new teacher should implement immediately? --SEATING CHARTS!! Also, everyday procedures such as retrieving notebooks from a filing cabinet or a daily opener. Have an attention grabber and classroom rules beyond the basics like respect others (no eating, phone usage procedures, headphones in class, etc.)  
What is your management style? Is there anything about your management style that you wish you could change? --My management style is calm and organized. I implement procedures and stick to them, and students know what to expect everyday, such as every Monday we do vocabulary, and everyday we begin with 10 minutes of silent reading. The rules are clear and students know what is expected of their behavior. Always stick to a seating chart and don't be afraid to move a student. Give respect and you will get it back (usually). I wouldn't change anything about my style - I rarely have management issues and even my toughest groups have good behavior. 

Hope this helps."
highschoolteachers,"Funny story,  my high school health teacher would spread glitter all over the school rec center to symbolize STDs,  because like glitter, they're everywhere and a pain to get rid of "
highschoolteachers,"I would also add: How knowledgable do you think recent high school grads are regarding finances? (student loans, credit cards, banking etc)

At least for me, I was woefully ingorant of the implications of taking out student loans when I graduated high school. Thankfully for my situation, my monthly payment is more of an annoyance and it hasn't turned into the black hole that I know others are currently in."

He was a professional liar, and duped me several times, even in his senior year when I should have known better. He has bullied several kids at school, and shoved my nephew's head into a car window, and never received a consequence because it was attributed to his tendency toward ""impulsive behavior"" as outlined in his joke of an IEP. In his senior year, he went to a party in the boonies and pushed a huge boulder into a kid's head and nearly sent the kid into a coma, and then a few months later he sexually molested another male student in the locker room in front of like 20 other kids. Pulled his pants down and started messing with his junk. He at least got indicted for that, but his lawyer managed to get him off without a single solitary consequence. Not one, not even a misdemeanor. This kid is just...evil."
highschoolteachers,"I think the relationship is actually important. I know in tenth grade I had trouble with geometry, but really enjoyed the class because my teacher for that class, was funny, and she understood my shortcomings and forgave me for it. Of course, I was only really able to build on that relationship because she helped tutor me on that. Sometimes I may have forgotten to do my homework, but she wasn't *too* harsh on me, she was like ""Come on, Carlos"" and I just generally liked her as a teacher and valued her feedback. 

To me, it's not a surprise to see some students not care as much about their own learning as much as you do, as a teacher. I think 'learning' would be easier if schools were only for those that wanted to come learn and not the ones who were forced to come there. I think your best bet is to teach in a manner that intrigues students and lures them into wanting to learn about what you are teaching. 

Generally, I didn't find high school really helpful, but the few classes, like hers, I really found value in and I was really glad to be a part of it. Although, there could be other classes, like Spanish II Native, where I had a similar teacher who really understood me, and cared for my success, but I failed and got a D because I really didn't get it. Oh well."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly if a high school aged child is so starved for attention from their mom that her sitting in class wouldn't be absolutely mortifying, I so hope she follows through just so they can spend some time with her.  This poor kid."
highschoolteachers,"In one of my student teaching placements I had a 7th grade clasa with 1:1 laptops. Every student had an assigned laptop they would get at the beginning of the day and carry until the day ended. It was amazing. Being able to grade everything online and give immediate feedback the students could access at home was super helpful. I could post powerpoints as soon as I taught them, attach explicit instructions to every dropbox, and send reminders about long term assignments. I never had students complaining that they lost assignments or left something they needed at home. Being able to count on every student having laptop access really opened up what I could do in the classroom, because I didn't need to schedule things like writing, researching, or accessing a website around the schedule of a shared space like a library or computer lab. Teaching now at a school where I don't have this luxury, I definitely feel way more limited and that I need to spend more time on trivial things like scheduling computer access, preparing hard copies of literally every material we need, etc. I also feel that students at this school are lacking basic computer skills because the lack of texh avilability encourages teachers to avoid using it. My 7th graders were completely self-suffiicent doing basic computer tasks. My high schoolers now can barely figure out how to use a web bowser or  word processor; getting them to submit assignments online is an exercising in hand-holding misery. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a senior in high school and the time of applying to colleges and choosing your career you want to do for the rest of your life is here. I want to become a history teacher and my mom doesn't want me to at all. She says that isn't where the money was and that I'll get burnt out real fast and is doing whatever she can to lead me away from it. I don't know what to say to defend my decision to want to go into it, what are some counter arguments that I can use in support of teaching to maybe win my mom over. Thanks in advance."
highschoolteachers,Let me just say that  high school English teachers are simply mad.  I teach science and grade one lab report a quarter.  That's enough to send me into a spiral of self loathing and depression for the 150 plus students I have.
highschoolteachers,"This is a well intentioned suggestion, but if the kid isn’t doing classwork, it feels like a bad precedent to allow them to do some sort of social media independent study instead. Plus, and I mean no disrespect, if this is a high school student, they’re going to find that meme suggestion pretty cringe inducing. "
highschoolteachers,I hear ya man.  You guys get the shaft all the time.  In my opinion you are some of the few at the high school who are truly changing lives every day at a life saving and changing level.  And that’s no shit.  Sure I help kids learn chemistry  but for the most part they can function day to day without me or my topic.  Not SPED.
highschoolteachers,"Please note that I am a high school English teacher with class sizes averaging about 34. I should be clear, I don’t think that anyone should have to work crazy hours like we do. SPED teachers who are working IEPs, etc. are the backbone of a school in my humble opinion. The problem I am naming is the teachers who go out of their way telling everyone how they spend every hour of their day working on teaching. I respect those people for what they do, but that should not be our norm. The point is we all have our own systems for teaching our students. Some people need to spend more time, and some don’t. The real issue is that those who have to spend more time, like SPED teachers, should have contracts that reflect that work, and pay them accordingly. I personally am fine with good SPED programs being paid higher than my general Ed work.

My strategies:

I grade portions of essays instead of whole essays. I have week long process papers where I go from student to student to work with them on their work in class so their final essay requires less heavy lifting in terms of grading. I plan our lessons using materials I have, and generating new ideas. Do I spend time outside of the classroom, absolutely, but I’m not going to make anyone who doesn’t do that feel badly for having their own system, and when we see all these teachers getting awards being espoused for the endless hours they spend in the classroom we are pitching a message that that is the only thing that works. Just because something took longer doesn’t mean it is inherently better. 

I’ll just end by saying teachers deserve more credit than they get. It doesn’t matter what you’re teaching, what you do is important. We are changing lives in this profession, and we all deserve to feel like we are doing a good job. Keep on fighting the good fight, and know that you are doing something good. 
"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English, and there’s no way I can do all of my stuff by the time the final bell rings. 

I have two small kids now (4 and 5), and I do not take work home anymore. 

Instead, I am strict with my time at work: I do all my “stuff” (goal-setting, phone calls, conferences, ARDs, copies, planning, emails, etc) just during my off period.

After school is just for grading, and if I do about an hour a day, it doesn’t become unmanageable.

I’ve learned a lot of ways to get more efficient:

1. I only check email during my conference, for example. Once or twice (typically right before school and right after school), I will just eyeball it to make sure there’s nothing immediate. 

2. Make copies for things in batches. This is also handy in case I have an unexpected absence - my copies are already made.

3. I have students trade-and-grade as much as possible. Your “bad” class may not be able to do this, but just ask your best class to do it in exchange for a jolly rancher. Jolly ranchers are cheap and don’t trigger common allergies. Remember that trade-and-grade does NOT violate FERPA.

4. Save heavy socializing/venting for happy hour. If someone wants to socialize while you want to work, smile broadly and tell them, “You know what? I’ve got a lot to do at the moment. Could we maybe catch a drink on Friday and catch up? I want to give you my full attention, and I’ve got all this to do right now.” ***This does not apply to people who are actively crying! 

Also: If a co-worker wants to shoot around some ideas for a lesson, offer to come to THEIR room and brainstorm with them. This way, YOU can leave when you feel like you’ve come to a conclusion.

It’s your time, guys. Protect it."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I see posts like this and can’t help but notice that none of them are high school English teachers. 

You just can’t never assign extended writing pieces. Even writing short pieces takes time from us if we’re giving out feedback. “Peer edit?” you can’t do that every single time. "
highschoolteachers,"Regarding high school:  college admissions counselors know about grade inflation.  They know schools that are notorious for grade inflation/distortion, bloated AP enrollment (but crap scores), etc.  This is tough in states that have auto-admit for certain class rank/GPAs, but generally speaking these schools that inflate grades aren't really fooling anybody.  "
highschoolteachers,When I was in high school my AP Lang class had 45 kids in it.  It was my second biggest class that year.
highschoolteachers,"Something that's always left out of these discussions is the change from norm referenced grading to criterion referenced grading. I had plenty of classes in high school and college (math and science especially) where exams consisted of whatever tangentially related questions the instructor wanted to ask. As a result, exam grades were much lower and the instructors scaled grades to resemble a normal distribution. Now that all instruction and exam items have to be connected to learning standards that students receive at the beginning of a unit, I would expect grades to be higher than they were back in the 60's.

I'm not saying that it's the major contributor to grade inflation, but it's something that people always seem to forget."
highschoolteachers,"Oh absolutely, sorry if I didn't state that clearly enough. I'm often annoyed that we're so by the letter, because I've known more than a handful of kids who could have gotten a regular diploma had they had just a few tiny modifications in one subject - modifications they could have gotten a state over. 

I was just trying to explain a possible mechanism behind that ""high schools throw out IEPs"" sentiment. We don't, but it does look super different, here. 

Sped really isn't supposed to be a life sentence, in any case (for high incidence kids, anyway). The idea is, if they really get the remediation they need, they can manage the impact of their disability on their own, and should no longer need services. They absolutely need to be weaning off support in the high school years, cause there is no inclusion teacher in the real world."
highschoolteachers,"How about shorter essays, or grading as you go? I don't teach high school, but with my kids, the use Google Docs to write their essays and I grade a little bit of it each day. So if today we worked on introduction paragraphs, then I'll grade everyone's intro paragraph tonight. Give them feedback as needed. Then I'm not left with a ton of long essays to grade at the end"
highschoolteachers,"Exactly. These policies of endless retakes, no due dates, and (at least at my school) no consistency in behavior management from Admin have really burned me out. I coteach 6 classes of 30 students a day, and they’re so naughty I feel like I have to babysit. They do what they want because they know there are no consequences anymore. I’m 3 years in to teaching and I’m already looking for the door. That can’t be good. 

Edit: I teach high school. Overall I teach 180 students a day. "
highschoolteachers,"It’s been 14 years and I still don’t see how this is possible. I’m open to any tips, as I coach (and am now pregnant) as well. I teach high school English, and classes are in the 40s each, 5 per day. Aside from rubrics, peer grading (which isn’t always possible) and group essays, how can I cut down on essay grading time? They are high level classes, but still need lots of work on writing. I feel weird and guilty assigning only a piece of an essay, unless someone has tips on how to make that still feel “finished.” Thanks in advance for any advice. 

EDIT: Wow! Thanks to everyone who gave feedback! I tried to reply to everyone, but even if I missed you, please know i read it and I really appreciate it!"
highschoolteachers,My high school has the exact same policy. It’s made me really not like my job. 
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Woah, what standard is binder organization?

To be honest with you skills like organization, study habits and time management absolutely should be standards. We (mostly middle school and high school teachers) expect students to have these skills and complain when they don't, but we really don't teach them. Sure, some teachers and schools try to, but it's almost always in a half-assed ""not academic content or part of the curriculum so it doesn't really matter"" way."
highschoolteachers,"One of the elements that I think is unfairly neglected in these conversations is the anxiety that grade inflation causes high school students. I teach at a fairly prestigious, all-girl Catholic school. The students are insanely stressed out, despite rampant grade inflation. Our median weighted GPA (including electives) is over 3.7! In my experience, I literally cannot give a grade below a B-, unless the student has actively not completed work. If the student is utterly incompetent, but turned everything in on time, she'll probably get a B. We joke that we only give two grades: A, for not so bad, and B, for not so good.  


Besides the philosophical problems with giving these high grades, I've noticed that the students exist in a perpetual state of stress. In their minds, anything below an A is a failing grade. Because of this, they live in abject fear of getting anything below 100%. I write pretty hard quizzes (considering I'm teaching an AP class), and students report studying all hours of the night in fear of them. They cannot experiment, they cannot learn. All they do is worry. Since we've flattened the grading range by so much, they only see success and failure, and the fact of the matter is, there needs to be a place for students who 1. are not failing, but 2. are not excelling. We just don't have that."
highschoolteachers,"What do grades mean outside of school? What do they impact?

* Good grades impact college scholarships, so they're important for lightening student debt burden

* Good grades impact acceptance into the elite colleges (if your parents don't have the money to buy your way in)

* Bad grades keep you from getting a high school diploma and put you on the school-to-prison path

That's about all I can come up with.

We see everything through our lenses of being in the trenches every day, dealing with poor attitudes and poor current-fad education programs, and our rose-tinted lenses of how much better school was ""back in our day"" when we didn't mess around and if you couldn't cut it, you didn't pass.

We take it personally and get offended when a kid doesn't make any effort until a week before the end of the quarter and refuse to let them turn in missing work.

We focus on the ""life lessons"" of deadlines and following procedure and grade on that rather than our curriculum.

I think it's important to pull back, distance ourselves from our daily battles, and take a wider view of grading, of education, of their purposes, and of our purposes. To see the forest for the trees, to make sure we're not calling a molehill a mountain.

When I read the concerns this blogger brings up in their blog that they have linked us to, I find myself asking: ""So?""

If I cannot come up with how a given concern of ours is going to negatively impact my students' lives when they get out of compulsory education and enter adult life, that concern becomes unimportant to me."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; In America, particularly in my state, there is a world of difference between the services we can offer in elementary and high school. High schoolers are earning credits towards graduation, and must complete all the work the other kids do without modifications. (Accommodations are fine, but you can't change the content or assessment or the kid doesn't get a credit for the class, end of story).

To clarify: This varies by state. It is not ""in America,"" but particular to a given state (as you also said).

&gt;They also have to pass subject area tests, which are standardized and required for graduation.

Also varies by state. "
highschoolteachers,"That's almost like O-Chem I at my college, but my high school didn't offer o-Chem so I died with a B-. Rip. "
highschoolteachers,"It's like grade inflation is bad but at the same time you have to realize how much relies on grades. I had to keep a pretty high GPA to keep some scholarships and a lot of other students do to. Even in high school to start getting a scholarship I needed to have a certain HS GPA. Yes C was an average back in the 70s but college was way cheaper. A C wouldn't end your college career.

While teaching in college I tried not to make stuff too easy but instead offer a lot of support but my supervisor was really strict on wanting all the graduate teachers to get a certain student evaluation average. I know other teachers who got better reviews than me by basically having the test review be the test but slightly different wording and here I am trying to put together some crosswords and matching and putting page numbers by where you can look up the answer.

I think if things relied less on grades it would be better and grades would be more accurate. How silly is it that if you got a B in one class instead of an A your GPA might slip enough you lose a scholarship? That puts a lot of pressure on teachers too since teacher reviews are related to what grade student expect to receive and you never know when your students one letter grade lower in your class puts them under some GPA boundary for some scholarship they would probably leave college without."
highschoolteachers,I know here in Louisiana they hand out IAPs without a second thought. I have quite a large number of students with accommodations ranging from extended time to test read aloud to leaving the classroom when they’re triggered by anything. I’m a high school teacher. 
highschoolteachers,"In America, particularly in my state, there is a world of difference between the services we can offer in elementary and high school.

They also have to pass subject area tests, which are standardized and required for graduation. 

Since elementary schools don't require ""credit"" and there is no mastery component (e.g., a subject area test), they can get away with a lot more ""helping"" than we can at the high school level. They're doing a giant disservice to the kids, though, who will not be prepared for high school as a result.

In my experience, this is largely because they do not know how different high school is. They're trying to get the kid through, but they're doing it the easy way, rather than actually remediating deficits.

You shouldn't have a bunch of kids qualifying for IEPs if they don't have a true disability, though. If your school is running a sped department bigger than around 10% of your population, there's a problem. "
highschoolteachers,"I work at an amazing school district and my students are highly motivated to be successful thanks to years of their parents taking an active role in their education.  I’d also like to think I have numerous instructional strategies for success.  When I think about grade inflation I always get confused by my experiences. 90% of my students final grade is based on unit tests.  I have numerous formative and self assessments that allow my students to focus on the concepts they need help with.  Typically, the median grade on these challenging exhaustive tests is a 93-94%. 80% of my students have As. I’m in one of the largest districts in my state and we have the highest attendance and graduation rate.  We also have 100% of students pass their state tests and massive success on SAT and AP scores.  We are an incredibly academically focused school.  We have 7000 brilliant high school students working their asses off for their As.  Is it possible that grade inflation is also partly a product of improved education, access to internet, and increased motivation?  "
highschoolteachers,Are there not IEPs in high school in Canada?
highschoolteachers,You teach o-Chem in high school?
highschoolteachers,"I work in a school board that no longer fails elementary students. We just give them IEPs, accommodate or modify their needs and keep them with their age group. When they get to high school, they are streamed by ability/post-secondary path and the IEPs we babies them with throughout elementary are thrown out the window. Why even bother with the damned IEPs in the first place? Beyond the politically-correct, “give every student success” it’s just a way to buy time and save face. 

Let’s keep them back and teach them properly. When will we get back to that? "
highschoolteachers,"Totally agree. With so much tech being developed for the classroom, we really have to consider if it adds any value to the educational process. I feel like a lot of the programs being developed help with keeping students engaged, which is nice, but at the end of the day, does it really help them with the necessary skills that they need to succeed in higher education or their post-secondary careers? (I’m a high school teacher). It’s nice to have students be super engaged in a lesson and to use tech for convenience, but if it doesn’t aid in actually developing their skills, what’s the point?"
highschoolteachers,"I'm of two minds on this.

For the teacher side of the equation, tech can really help, but it requires learning and understanding how to use it *for your classroom*. Just throwing a new laptop at a teacher and linking, say, Google Classroom is more of a gimmick than actually offering paid training to learn examples of what you can do in Google Classroom. Same thing with Blackboard, or Canvas, or whatever other new thing. And whatever is adopted and used should be the choice of the teacher; not everyone should use Classroom, or Blackboard, or whatever to the same degree, if they don't want to.

It has the potential to make classes virtually paperless (I say virtually, because--at least for me--nothing will take the place of a pen-and-paper exam). Tech is beneficial in that I can, for example, randomly generate any number of variations on a problem and have a computer spit out the new solution, rather than solving it over, myself. This is a godsend for preventing cheating on exams, or creating new study guides, etc with the push of a button. But I only know how to do that because I went and found the tech and learned the programming to do that in my own. It's not hard, necessarily, but it's a time-consuming process to learn something new. How many of us have the time or inclination to do the same?

Now, for the students: I worry a lot about the closed-source nature of things. Private companies push their tech in to make money, plain and simple. They may advertise lofty ideals about educating our children, but the bottom line is money, especially when it comes to companies that make operating systems and sell computers. (Google, Apple, and Microsoft.) They may make their stuff cheap or free to students... But that's because they know if they get people to learn their product early in life, it creates a dependency: they are far more likely to continue buying products from that company later in life. Why do you think Microsoft became so dominant in the workplace? We were collectively convinced that ""people in business use this, so students should learn it, too"", and then that prophecy fulfilled itself by the people who grew up using Microsoft only being able to use Microsoft, meaning their kids had to learn it, too.

We don't teach kids how to *use* their computers; we teach them how to use specific programs in a particular operating system. And even then, we assume kids know how to use this stuff simply because they grew up around it. It's simply not true!

And it's doubly-infuriating when the products are clearly inferior. Chromebooks are just terrible. The keyboards do not have number pads, and their tab key is now a ""search for apps"" key. You must have an internet connection to do any work on a Chrome book. You can't modify the software that's available--if it's not in the locked-down app store, you can't get it. Docs, Sheets, and Slides try to emulate the Microsoft or Apple alternatives, but don't work well: equation editors are terrible; formatting changes are as unpredictable as Word or Pages; just about the only positive thing is that it lets you upload stuff to a place accessible anywhere (with an internet connection), but Microsoft now has an answer for that, now. I imagine Apple will, too. The only unique thing that Google has is Classroom, but I imagine the other tech companies are working on a competitor. 

And don't even get me started on the clawed tentacles that textbook companies like Pearson use to try to hook into classes, with their online textbook supplements (priced pretty high, per student), and their custom-designed, mandated-by-law statewide exams (such as PARCC), instead of states developing their own high school graduation exams (often for cheaper and with better-measurable results). 

Meanwhile, we (as taxpayers) get stuck footing the bill for all these services and products because some principal or supervisor thinks it'll be good optics to pursue it and force everyone to use it, whether or not it is actually better than what is already there. Everyone gets distracted thinking that new = better. And private companies profit off of public endeavors. 

And, for both students and teachers: I worry that tech companies are gathering data on us to sell to advertisers, among other things. I don't want to participate in the normalization of this data collection--rather, I want to be part of fighting against it. Our lives should not be all uploaded for private companies to pore over, catalog, and market to, or for governments to surveil. The tools I use should be open-source, for all to see, inspect, modify, and improve. That's the very ideal of what we strive for, as teachers, right? That information about the world is open; that anyone can contribute and improve what we all use. And the ability to reach those goals are severely limited by this rent-seeking behavior.

tl;dr tech, when implemented well, can be very helpful. But the way most tech is implemented now means that whatever aid is offered is often canceled out by net negative social impacts. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school.  I think having the kids working on Chromebooks in class can often be a huge cop-out orchestrated to placate the ""student-centered""-obsessed out there.  The belief that a teacher should basically never give direct instruction has, in my experience, led to an erosion of basic skills that persists well into high school (I teach ELA - think spelling, commas, subject/verb agreement, etc.).  But wait...spellcheck/Grammarly helps with this stuff, right?  Nope, not in my experience.  Kids believe they can rely on these technologies but ultimately don't.  "
highschoolteachers,"I remember a requirement like that with the P-SAT in high school.  One day of administration, no make up testing, and also the ONLY way to qualify for the state scholarship program.  Sad day for anyone that was sick and in need of a scholarship."
highschoolteachers,"It definitely has its ups and downs. Coming from my experiences as a high school teacher, I personally find the use of tech in the classroom be more burden than blessing. My biggest pet peeve with it is that students don't know how to use it responsibly (i.e. they will use their device to play games, access social media when they should be doing their work in class). There's also the fact that some apps allow kids to cheat or cut corners in their learning--for example, there is a translator app offered by Google that allows students to take a picture of a document in another language, and translate it directly to their native language, as opposed to trying to read it for themselves (which is a serious problem if this app is being used for a language-learning course). I like to upload handouts on Google Classroom to save on photocopying costs, yet from personal experience, notice that many students will choose not to complete these handouts or are more likely to forget to do them unless they're on a physical piece of paper. Add that to the fact that I have to play the role of tech support when students don't know how to upload a homework assignment or register for an account; and technology can honestly be such a headache.

However, this isn't to say that I completely frown on the use tech in school. Services like Quizlet, Padlet, YouTube, Kahoot and Google Drive offer many fun and innovative ways for students to collaborate and review course material. For someone who has horrific handwriting, I also like that I can type up my notes and display them through an LCD projector instead of writing them on the board. But the system does have its drawbacks. Students using their devices irresponsibly, tied with the fact that they feel that using it in the classroom is a right instead of a privilege, are just two of them."
highschoolteachers,I got an email asking if I could just bump the F to a D as the student really wanted to stay in cheer. They said that since the pandemic started they really needed that activity to stay active in high school. Could you try staying active in chemistry? Lol
highschoolteachers,"I don't really have explicit advice, but I can empathize. Listen, most teachers can reflect back on their time as a student and think of the best and the worst teacher they had. My worst teacher was a history teacher in high school. Same time of thing. Literally all work was only copying glossary notes and dates. Tests were the stock, textbook tests which were brutally difficult because we literally never covered anything. It sucks, and I wish it wasn't like this, but for every stellar teacher, there's a pretty bad one.

My overall point is that unfortunately, there may not be much you can do. You can try to have a parent call, or appeal. Make sure you HAVE EVERYTHING IN WRITING. Any time you talk to the teacher about assignments/grades make sure it's through e-mail. Evidence will be your only hope if you can get someone to listen. Don't wait till the end of the quarter/semester/year if you are going to do something."
highschoolteachers,"Well, I teach in California, I was a sub for a bit, and I was a paraprofessional before all that, so I comment on your post with a degree of certainty behind my words. 

Points 1, 2, and 3 are spot on. Public perception of what education is like is usually informed by movies, and other popular media. People, including teachers, hold misconceptions about what it is like to teach at different levels. For some reason, they think public high school must be like teaching in a warzone. Having taught in all three levels, I can assure you without a doubt that high school is the easiest (for many of the reasons you mentioned). There is no more hand holding, and the students are at a level where you can now have serious and meaningful discussions on all manner of topics which, for me at least, is fulfilling.

Points 4 and 5 are not exactly correct. To begin with, in my district, once subs work a certain number of days a year they are entitled to benefits. Also, it's not a ""dead end job."" Many subs who do this as a career make much more than teachers at the lower half of the salary table. This is because there is a difference between the pay for long-term subbing and day-to-day subbing. Long-term subbing pays much more but requires you to take on much more responsibility. I know several subs who go year after year subbing like this and they make much more money than I do as a 6th year teacher. Secondly, there are people who use this kind of work as contingency for what they really like doing. Here in LA, lots of subs are actors, musicians, artists, grad students, business owners, etc. I'm assuming that when one of these people go on a date they don't refer to themselves as subs but rather what they are passionate about. This leads me to a side point I just want to mention. Substitute teachers are some of the weirdest people I have ever met. I don't know if anyone else will agree with me on this.

Point 6 is not my case at all. Many of the teachers I've met fall into three distinct categories. 

The first is the wife/husband of a high earning lawyer, doctor, or other high earning professional. They teach for the love of it or because they simply wanted to feel that they used their education for something, but they don't need to because their partner makes far more than they ever could. And YES, I do agree with you, these people tend to be oblivious about the realities many of their students have to contend with. So, during distance learning they assume everyone has a wonderful little office space like they do from which to zoom and do work, when in reality they live in a single and are trying to zoom in a corner of their bunk bed because their family is walking around and there is no privacy. They then have the gall to demand student turn their cameras on putting them in an uncomfortable, and dare I say, vulnerable position. Of course they have great internet access at their large middle class home, but their students do not, so by having everyone turn their cameras on it drops everyone's bandwidth and everything gets choopy and pixelated for them. 

The second is the teacher who has put his/her years of education to work outside of the classroom by opening a business, investing, or earning on side gigs related to education (tutoring, daycare, home school, etc.) Teaching has becomes secondary to something else and they hang around for the benefits, and some because they love teaching.

The third is the teacher who is laser focused on the career and is either planning to move up to administrative position later, or simply wants to continue teaching. I'm in this category. These teachers are not middle class at all. I would consider them working class, if that. They make less than the people who come to repair the air conditioning systems at school. I know, I've asked.

Finally, about paraprofessionals. I would say it's a mixed bag. Some, especially from a substitute's perspective can be helpful. But there are many out there who were left behind by education and simp0ly stand around unable to help in a meaningful way."
highschoolteachers,"During the day, I deliver sandwiches for Jimmy John's. At night, I'm an ELL teacher at an adult ed center. Between the two jobs, it's basically a 12 hour day. My income between the two of them is still less than I was making as a high school English teacher. I was a full-time teacher with my own classroom, and now I deliver sandwiches by day and teach immigrants English by night, all on insufficient sleep and a shitty diet because I don't have time to properly grocery shop.

And I am still so fucking glad that I quit."
highschoolteachers,Physics girl is doing a Physics 101 video series (youtube) that is targeted to high school AP physics. Let her do some teaching and assign some problems. She is great.
highschoolteachers,"People are digging into this web quest example too much!.

I am a high school English teacher and this was my experience exactly. I had one reading course and one methods course that I found very helpful. Ed psych and special Ed classes were applicable too in some small ways. Unfortunately, there are just way more primary teachers so classes are geared toward that."
highschoolteachers,"Damnit. I know your frustration. There are approximately 40 teachers district wide with underlying conditions that prevent us from returning with students (I am certain there are many more simply because the size of the district, but about 40 of us went through the process of getting and submitting the appropriate documentation and paperwork). The district has thrown so many plans our way. This is the latest iteration. 

I am grateful that the district is working to accommodate us, but it feels ugly. I feel like I’m letting my colleagues and my students down. Cases in my county/state are surging hard and it’s frightening. It’s simply ridiculous that we’re bringing thousands of people back into buildings, especially at the high school level, where students are going back to attend each of their classes in person for...wait for it...five times a month. That’s it. They’re going back to attend each class FIVE TIMES A MONTH. This is worth it? 

I hope you hear back. I hope they listen and respond appropriately. Stick it out, or don’t. I know I won’t if I’m forced into the classroom. I can’t. It’s not worth my life. I’ve been doing this better than 20 years, and I’ve never felt so dehumanized and unappreciated. It’s so so ugly."
highschoolteachers,"I worked twenty years as a graphic designer before I switched to teaching high school art 15 years ago. 

I really think the stress is pretty similar. There’re always impossible deadlines, and there’s always something Very Important depending on your success. And even if everyone else in the pipeline screwed up, you’re made to feel as if it’ll be all your fault if things go poorly.

In certain seasons you may have to work 80-90 hour weeks, while in others you can just about phone it in. 

Summers off are nice, but so is just taking a couple of days off without having to leave extensive plans for someone to do your job while you’re away (or taking an hour off to run an errand).

In my case, the benefits are much better in teaching, and the salary Isn’t that bad either. But I may be an outlier in this regard. 

Overall, yes, I’m pretty happy with the switch. There are a few days when I think I won’t be able to take it anymore, but that’s about how my old job was. I mean, I don’t particularly love teaching, but it’s a pretty good job as far as jobs go. I’d quit in a heartbeat if I suddenly came into a couple of million, and I’m definitely not doing it because I love kids. But I do value an educated citizenry, and this is more fun than a lot of other jobs I could be stuck with."
highschoolteachers,The activities I remember best from my high school english or even social studies was the webquests. They were a great way to find sources and learn about a topic. They aren't very feasible at the elementary level.
highschoolteachers,"I don't know. I stopped writing them. I don't see a purpose, at least at the high school level."
highschoolteachers,"Happened with my high school class too. I had one student test positive and a support staff member who frequents the class a few times a week. Yes, we’re all safe and okay and not at any risk."
highschoolteachers,"I understand that they are fun activities but like, I don't see myself really using them given the time constraints of teaching high school. 45 minute classes don't leave much room for these kind of projects or activities."
highschoolteachers,Those aren’t great in elementary Ed either.  In fact I would have thought it was better for middle or high school.
highschoolteachers,"Please don’t let her defeat you. The profession and your future students will both benefit immensely from your voice. I am so sorry that your cooperating teacher isn’t supportive of you. 

What level/subject are you teaching? I am in my fifteenth year of teaching high school English - if I can support you and root you on in some way, let me know."
highschoolteachers,"I’m at a high school in rural North Florida, and tats/piercings seem to go over just fine. I expect that if they were really wild (I knew a guy once with half his face tattooed, for instance) they might affect first impressions in an interview, but I don’t think they’re in any way sanctioned."
highschoolteachers,"I felt the same thing... I LOVE subbing, and I took the high school off my list. I only work elementary and I’ll pick up middle school positions only for people I know. I do not go to the middle school or the high school. Elementary kids are my favorite to work with. I suppose I have been working in a small school as a sub for 4 years now so the kids do know me, but even in the early days they were always more fun... I have my license in secondary, I sub because I hated it and don’t want to go back and redo student teaching but I truly wish I would have taught kindergarten. I always have so much fun and I think I’m lucky, the teachers know I love to teach and I’m capable so they leave me the lessons exactly as they would have taught anyways. I love, love, love, teaching the  younger students. If I could teach them forever as my own class, I would, but for now I sub."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school, I remember having to legitimately use the restroom during class all the time. I drank a lot of water I guess. One teacher of mine didn't allow us to leave during class and I stormed out in an angry fit as to not pee myself. Was I a terrible kid? 

I think it's important to give ownership to the students about taking care of themselves when needed. If we didn't make leaving in the middle class so taboo, I don't think students would take advantage of it as much. Obviously covid brings about additional concerns, but I think there are still ways to navigate this in different situations, beginning by recognizing that students can be great people despite having behaviorial issues that we don't always know the cause of."
highschoolteachers,Look on Edpuzzle for any Cosmos episodes by Neil Degrasse Tyson. Many already have questions premade and my high school students like that the questions just pop up so they don’t have to go back and forth to a worksheet.
highschoolteachers,"Yeah...  I'm a high school teacher. Little kids can understand consent. The main worry is fights. Haven't had it happen, but that's why good lanyards have snaps on them."
highschoolteachers,"I (female) don’t hug students, to protect myself. I teach high school. If it was a small child, I’d kneel down to their level and pat their shoulder or hold their hand, but not hug. I typically won’t touch a student at all, outside of a fist bump or high five (pre-covid)."
highschoolteachers,"I will never penalize a student for being quiet / shy / not liking to answer questions or speak up in class, as long as I can tell that they are otherwise engaged and doing what they need to do. It drove me crazy in high school seeing ""Needs More Class Participation"" as the only negative comment on every single report card - one quarter I even got it from four different teachers. I'll never forget the relief I felt when my 10th grade chemistry teacher said ""If you don't like to talk in class, that's okay, as long as I know that you're coming to class, taking notes, and doing your homework."" - and she was the only teacher I ever had who said anything like that."
highschoolteachers,"This makes sense. High schoolers need to be gaining independence. 

&gt;If I'm in the middle of a lesson, you probably want to stay. Once I'm wrapping up the lesson and assigning the assignment problems, safer to go.

Interestingly (to me anyway), I used to do it this way, and then a couple of years ago I switched it up so that students could go during the introduction but not during work time (obviously they still go if it's an emergency), and I haven't found myself repeating myself any more than I used to. 

Granted, I teach elementary literacy, and nothing I *tell* a child about reading or writing will do nearly as much for him as his actually *doing* it will.

I can imagine that a lot of high school curriculum isn't really like that."
highschoolteachers,"If u/falaladoo does the same system as me, the students don't have to ask me at all. If they see the hall pass, then it's first come, first serve. If the pass is gone, then they have to wait unless it's an emergency. Once the pass comes back, some of the kids that wanted to go completely forgot about wanting to go.

Granted I teach at a high school and for the most parts, the students know when is a good time to go and when isn't a good time to go. If I'm in the middle of a lesson, you probably want to stay. Once I'm wrapping up the lesson and assigning the assignment problems, safer to go.

I should note that is was pre covid. In the middle of covid and distance learning, the kids can just get up and go. They're at home and I'm wherever I decide to teach from. Nothing I can really do to stop them from going."
highschoolteachers,"Ya my experiences put me on the other end of the spectrum long ago.  I've had high school soccer/football teams at my house.  My 4 kids all went where I taught and that meant their friends/teams at my house constantly.  My daughters/sons have dated my students.  My students make a point of finding my house for Halloween.  I see my students at church.  

I grew accustomed to it a long time ago.  It's not weird at all and I'm definitely not going to act different or feel awkward just cuz some student is around.  But I've been doing this for 20 years so maybe I'm more comfortable than some.

But I get it.  I know some teachers won't live near their school because they don't want to cross those lines.  Whatever that's fine.  

I don't think my experiences are atypical.  In my experience most teachers get weird around students outside of school."
highschoolteachers,"Were doing training for the American reading company  the past  week and I am a high school teacher and was placed with elementary teachers and was shocked when they said they didn't start focusing on phonics until 3rd grade.

 I remember doing  hooked on phonics before  I went to kindergarten"
highschoolteachers,"I teach 6-12th grade all subjects (all in one room at the same time) and my students work extremely self-paced. We are also 100% standards-based, so I have kids working on different things within the same grade level. I just make sure to have some time every day to get face time with each kid for each subject so that we can discuss and I can get a good feel for how they’re doing/how they’re processing the info. Some days I might only get three minutes with my high school social studies kids because I need thirty minutes to focus strictly on 6th grade math instruction, so it’s a definite game of give and take. I like having them working fairly self-paced though because it gives us flexibility."
highschoolteachers,"I can see that for really large middle and high schools. But at the elementary level, at least, I think they're pretty silly. There are just shy of a thousand kids at my school and in all of my encounters with children in the hallways, I've never once even considered that they might not have a teacher's permission."
highschoolteachers,have a look at roundpier - great extracurricular platform for high school students
highschoolteachers,"Right, but why? If a student leaves a classroom without permission, that's a pretty damn big deal, no? Like, the sort of thing that you/your principal would immediately alert the whole school about so that everyone who is not teaching can look for him/her? 

I guess it's different in middle school and high school where students have different passing periods and don't travel in groups, but in elementary at least, it seems like a pretty unnecessary source of yuck..."
highschoolteachers,"My experience has been similar with the age groups in SPED, also in California, for the last 5 years.  Generally, the high school kids are the best, with behavior deteriorating until the elementary, where they about lose their minds when I sub.  And they know me, because I only sub in this one school for all the reasons you listed, and I student taught some of them.  But it's not their routine and they can't handle.  Their routine changes everyday and if I don't have the schedule, which happens, its a long long day.  And in this school, the paras are very good, so when they are not available, I am in straight survival mode.  I make so little money as a sub but I do it to keep in the field so my references will be fresh.  I also like the other teachers, but there are many times they call me and tell me the room and I say, nope, not available today (for that)."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with almost everything here, but I subbed for years at the junior high and high school level before trying elementary and I personally think elementary is so much easier! They actually still like you at that age so classroom management seemed like a breeze in comparison. I'm in junior high ELA now, but if I had subbed at the lower level earlier, I probably would have gone down that credentialing path instead.  I did find the more time I spent at the same school, it made all grades easier. And paraprofessionals are amazing and I almost always felt unnecessary when I was in a special ed classroom with a bunch of Paras that had been in the field for 20+ years and I was only there because they needed someone in the room with a bachelor's. I learned a ton from those people, though."
highschoolteachers,"I disagree for some positions. For middle &amp; high school I probably wouldn’t because you establish a different relationship with these students. However I think it’s appropriate for pre-k to elementary aged students. My first grades love when I call them my love bug or sweet pea, a lot of them don’t get that love at home and thrive when I am able to give it to them in person. There’s always a time and a place and I never use it in a degrading way. My principal has commented on how endearing and loving I am towards my students but also firm where they respect me."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; This information could then inform the teacher's instruction for this student;

That's just it though; what are the scenarios that lead to a student reading ""pony"" for ""horse?"" A student educated in a strong phonics program would be very unlikely to even make this particular kind of mistake in the first place. 

So to target this particular problem, the teacher differentiates some instruction they includes more phonics, or some specific strategies, as you say. 

But now you're implementing one program in order to deal with the deficits of another program when that other program helped to cause the deficit *in the first place.*

Research shows that phonics instruction paired with 3-queing just doesn't work because after students finish their phonics lesson, and they sit down to read and begin using context and pictures instead of phonics to learn to read (and this is why the student reads pony instead of horse) this *actively* weakens the phonics instruction they just had - and they continue to struggle. 

On one level, this makes sense: give students as many strategies as they can use and cultivate their ability to select the right strategy for the job. Let them use the pictures and context to identify the words on the page, and when that fails sound out the word. 

But human beings ***don't identify the words on the page through the strategies taught by 3-cueing.*** Pictures and context do help them to develop *meaning* but not identify words. Cognitive research fully bears this out. You aren't *reading* if you're getting the gist of a passage by skipping words and relying on predictive guesses and picture referencing, 

If a student is ""attending to meaning"" but not ""letter sound correspondence"" they can't really be said to be reading, strictly speaking, because what they are doing is unmoored from what is actually printed on the page. **English characters correspond to sounds** so if you are getting your meaning from, say memorizing entire words as individual pictures or ideograms, looking at the pictures, or memorizing sentence patterns you aren't actually interacting with the English language that is actually on the page in the way that English actually works. 

3-cueing is not just another window into a student's mind or another strategy in a student's toolbox. It actively undermines the other tools he has. 

From the guy responsible for the 3-cueing system, Ken Goodman, [interviewed last year](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.apmreports.org/amp/episode/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading): 

&gt;When I asked him what he makes of the cognitive science research, he told me he thinks scientists focus too much on word recognition. He still doesn't believe accurate word recognition is necessary for reading comprehension.

&gt; ""Word recognition is a preoccupation,"" he said. ""I don't teach word recognition. I teach people to make sense of language. And learning the words is incidental to that.""

&gt; He brought up the example of a child who comes to the word ""horse"" and says ""pony"" instead. His argument is that a child will still understand the meaning of the story because horse and pony are the same concept.

&gt; I pressed him on this. First of all, a pony isn't the same thing as a horse. Second, don't you want to make sure that when a child is learning to read, he understands that /p/ /o/ /n/ /y/ says ""pony""? And different letters say ""horse""?

&gt; He dismissed my question.

&gt; ""The purpose is not to learn words,"" he said. ""The purpose is to make sense.""

...

&gt; Goodman rejected the idea that you can make a distinction between skilled readers and unskilled readers; he doesn't like the value judgment that implies. He said dyslexia does not exist — despite lots of evidence that it does.

---------------- 

Research shows that a significant proportion of students will learn to read adequately in almost any reading program. There's a lot of other factors apart from curriculum. Which means that there is always going to be some amount of evidence ""showing"" that 3-cueing works. 

&gt; But some children will skip the sounding out if they're taught they have other options. Phonics is challenging for many kids. The cueing strategies seem quicker and easier at first. And by using context and memorizing a bunch of words, many children can look like good readers — until they get to about third grade, when their books begin to have more words, longer words, and fewer pictures. Then they're stuck. They haven't developed their sounding-out skills. Their bank of known words is limited. Reading is slow and laborious and they don't like it, so they don't do it if they don't have to. While their peers who mastered decoding early are reading and teaching themselves new words every day, the kids who clung to the cueing approach are falling further and further behind.

&gt; These poor reading habits, once ingrained at a young age, can follow kids into high school. Some kids who were taught the cueing approach never become good readers. Not because they're incapable of learning to read well but because they were taught the strategies of struggling readers.

----------------- 

Automatic word recognition is the best marker for strong reading skills because reading requires word recognition. The way in which human brains do that is by linking characters on the page to sounds, and then associating those sounds with a word they already know through background knowledge. *Not* by ""attending to meaning"" as if this could be done without attending to the letters on the page. The letters are the only thing on the page which can even be read. They represent sounds. The only way anybody reads, strictly speaking, is by attending to letter-sound correspondence. 

If students are ""attending to meaning* in the way that you're talking about, and the teacher is then devising lessons and practice opportunities to help the student ""attend to letter-sound correspondence,"" 1 of 2 things is going on: 

**1.** You have a student who is learning to read and a teacher is using phonics go teach them to read. 

Or 

**2.** The teacher is teaching students the skills of struggling readers and then is creating additional (phonics) lessons in order to teach the student how to read. 

Looking at pictures, using context clues, memorizing sentence patterns, memorizing whole words as pictures are what struggling readers do. They're what readers do when either decoding *fails* or the reader doesn't have the background to connect a properly decoded word with background knowledge. 

If students are ""attending to meaning"" when they read and are then receiving phonics instruction as a corrective measure, things are being done backwards: they are being asked to determine and construct meaning *before* they understand what is printed on the page, when not is what printed on the page that determines meaning. By ""attending to meaning"" in a way that doesn't attend to ""letter sound correspondence"" a child is doing any number of important and necessary activities related to reading *apart from actually reading.*

Again, this is not *reading*, but an ancillary bundle of skills that help to create meaning and supplement reading skills when word identification and ""attending to letter-sound correspondence"" breaks down."
highschoolteachers,"World Education Services (WES) or one of the states' recognized evaluators would have to take all of your transcripts -- from high school to the present -- and provide a course-by-course evaluation of your foreign credential.  This costs about $200 and takes a couple of weeks.  I can say with 98% confidence that your MA will be recognized as a MA unless there's something about it that's quirky or new compared to traditional EU/French/Bologna Process degrees.  So don't worry about that.  Where you'll run into problems is, of course, getting the state to recognize it as equivalent to a *teaching* degree, which, unless this degree results in government registration as a public school teacher in the country it was awarded, you're going to have problems.  If it *does* qualify you to teach in French public schools *in France*, it really won't be impossible to have it recognized in the US.  You would have to choose the state you want to qualify in (Florida is very straight-forward, for example) and submit all the evaluations and transcripts to them and they'll tell you what you have to do to qualify for a professional certificate.  Plan on being required to take the certification exams at minimum (PRAXIS, FTCE, etc.)."
highschoolteachers,"I start this tomorrow...with a twist. I am unable to return in person because of an underlying health condition. The district started remotely, gave into public pressure and started lower capacity in-person at the elementary level, then middle level, now high school. During that time I was able to work from home while those teachers/leadership not out on “medical remote” worked in the school buildings, teaching and administrating from there. 

Tomorrow, when half of my students return (cool, confusing lower capacity schedule in effect) I will continue teaching remotely from home while my in-person students are supervised by a long-term sub, who essentially has the cushiest long-term sub gig ever: no planning, no instruction, no grading, no parent contacts. He will make sure that the 11 students per class (many of whom are AP students) stay safe. My students will still receive instruction remotely because there is literally no other way for them to receive instruction from me. Now instead of being comfy in their jam jams and their beds at home, they’ll be dialing in from portable 5. 

Beyond that, however, why would any teacher plan separate lessons for their in-person and remote students? I am teaching the exact same way I’ve done since school started in August and if a parent does complain, it needs to be directed at leadership who devised this plan. It will be an interesting experiment, I suppose."
highschoolteachers,"In our elementary schools (we have 6), we’ve only had 6 cases all year with students in school every day. Our middle and high schools make up the rest. We’ve only had 5staff test positive in the district. All of them have been admins who have had to be in a room with a positive case."
highschoolteachers,For this reason we were told no paper this year. But I teach high school so it is doable.
highschoolteachers,"""𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯 𝘸𝘩𝘺... "" 

i gotta admit: i do this. i 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 actually gotten MUCH better about not, but i'm not quite outta the woods, yet. i don't use ""baby"" or ""friends,"" but can be apt to use ""sweet pea"" or ""kiddo,"" or ""hon,"" or "" bud.""

no one called me out on it (yet, couldn't blame them if so), but i brought it to my sage-friend mandy, because every once in awhile i'd get a look from a kid, like: ""what'd-you-just-call-me?!""    
(and rightly so.) mandy taught for 40+ years (yes, really) and asked me when i tended to use it most. i realized it was when i was asking or telling a student to do something, and had previously felt some ""static"" from them. also, when i didn't know them, yet, but had been ""warned"" they'd flip if even directed to get a pencil. 

i realized it was a way of trying to pacify them, beforehand; to say: ""i'm not scary; i'm not here to give 𝘺𝘰𝘶 any static. it's all good. no need to flip out."" 

also, i realized it was somewhat ingrained in me as a female: i was, essentially, asking permission to give a directive. 

i find it similar to what's known as ""up-talk"" - when someone, usually female, will make a statement? but, put a question mark on the end of it? and every ensuing statement, thereafter? as if getting permission to say what they say and know what they know? 

actually, the sex of a turtle is not determined by the male's sperm, but by the temperature at which its egg is incubated? 

i teach middle and high school, so i could be way off as far as commenting here, to you. but i think you're very wise to steer clear of it, yourself. it's not fair that males are more suspect, but that is what it is, unfortunately."
highschoolteachers,"There is a stark difference between male and female teachers in so many ways including the way they build relationships, the way students act with them, the way parents interact with them, etc. However, what you’re describing is the way each teacher is unique. I’ve heard plenty of male teachers at the elementary level call kids friends and other terms of endearment. What is key that if it doesn’t feel natural or authentic to you, then don’t do it. Just be yourself. Kids are really tuned into that. And while we are on the topic of what teachers call students - please dear god stop calling them kiddos! Just NO. I teach high school so it’s even worse when I hear a teacher refer to their students as kiddos and they teach 12th grade. FFS."
highschoolteachers,One sub once insinuated that my students would end up in jail after high school. One sub did lunges around the classroom and pushups on students desks while they were working.
highschoolteachers,I used to work in a high school mod/severe special ed classroom and to be quite honest that class would have been a nightmare without the paras. So I respectfully disagree on that point.
highschoolteachers,This sounds like my high school seniors tbh.
highschoolteachers,"I wondered that too. We were told there were too many one-off classes and kids’ schedules were too complicated for that to work. Some of our elementary school teachers just teach one or the other, but no high school teachers do. It’s not because of social distancing, unfortunately, because we still have large classes at school; I know there’s one freshman English class period with 29 F2F students and 5 remote. Most classes are more like 15-20 F2F and 5-10 remote, though."
highschoolteachers,"How different was it between “regular” and private school from sub’s point of view? I am subbing in regular high school, after I was offered the job in Catholic school but pay was very low."
highschoolteachers,"It’s a fucking awful year to be looking for a full time teaching job. I’m now back to living with my parents and subbing at my old high school. 

I’m 25 and definitely headed for a career change in the not too distant future."
highschoolteachers,"I graduated in Studio Arts and this is my first year teaching. I hated art in high school because it was crafty and not challenging. So I had big plans when I became a teacher. However, even though art class is meant to be the least stressful class, students still have no motivation. The problem I have found, is that students do not have patience and do not know how to critically think (which is my favorite part of art.) They believe it is a talent and get angry when they aren’t good at it immediately.

I use some resources from thevirtualinstructor.com. Also, my favorite book is Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Which is really helpful for students who are beginners and willing to challenge themselves."
highschoolteachers,"Whether it's worth it depends on your *goals.* People will recommend to get a more ""versatile"" Masters degree like curriculum and instruction, instructional design, learning tech, whatever...those degrees are useless if they don't align with your goals though. Curriculum and instruction, for example, is a pretty niche area. You have to really love it and want to be doing that stuff. Don't get that degree just because it ""opens more doors"". If your goal is to go into admin, get an educational leadership degree. If it's to teach high school physics, go for a physics masters. It all depends."
highschoolteachers,"I think you might have hit the nail on the the head when you said the counselors were thinking a kid is unlikely to go Ivy League due to us being Title 1. I hate that, however, because I am of the same demographic as my kids and I got “out” and went to a top tier school on scholarship. 

I think Dual and AP might be treated in the same category for state rating but the thing is, it’s not an even exchange numbers wise when they take kids out of the AP program. For one, as I said in my first post, they didn’t tell all the kids that they needed to enroll in CC to do dual so many missed the enrollment. (Despite hyping it up, they don’t bother to let the kids know the requirements of the entrance exam or CC application). Some of those kids have made it back to AP but not all. They also have for the past 3 years been letting kids drop AP with just a transfer form (even if they’re freshmen)  instead of getting teacher &amp; parent permission. So some kids are just going to regular and messing up the class sizes. We probably lost about 30 kids out of AP this year and the number of kids actually, properly  enrolled in Dual? Eight.

This is a weird and unique situation at our school that was caused by an incompetent administrator who was apparently incapable of doing math. Previously kids weren’t allowed to drop out of AP without the teacher &amp; parent signing off. When I realized what was happening the first year of that admin’s reign, I went to her about it and her response that it was the kid’s choice. I told her that if I were a parent and my 15 year old dropped all his college prep courses and the school didn’t notify me, I would be pissed, but she wouldn’t budge. The counselors basically told me to fuck off and once kids drop from my roster I lose all access to their records so I can’t call their parents myself, assuming I had that kind of time. Anyway, we went down about 2 letter grades in rating and now we have a new admin who has been taking an active role in rebuilding the AP program. Even after she told the counselors not to, they were still dropping kids from AP without notice, so we’ve still lost a lot, but she ripped the counselors a new one when she found out and it’s glorious. 

Dual doesn’t offer a very authentic experience at my school. It’s taught in a high school classroom by a high school teacher and though she has to abide by the community college requirements, since she’s employed by the school and not the community college, she also has to answer to all the school district BS too like 2 grades a week, parent phone calls if they don’t turn something in, unlimited redos and accepting late work without penalty. When it was taught by one of the CC professors apparently too many kids failed and started their college career with an F on their transcript. 

I agree that some community colleges teach very good classes. I had some great professors in mine, and I feel like that helped me bridge some of the gaps between my low income high school and my university. But I can’t deny that I felt my college classmates who came in with loads of AP credit weren’t better prepped, and that I still had lots of gaps compared to them. So that plus the fact that I teach AP and am now team lead of the program in my department probably makes me biased in favor of AP. I also like that having to follow the AP standards shields me in some ways from the latest district BS trend (like banning homework assignments, or telling English teachers they can’t assign novels, or imposing a paint-by-number curriculum) that the regular class teachers are constantly being subjected to."
highschoolteachers,"This is true. I'm a high school teacher. Fortunately for me, my state has gotten rid of my exams, so my students will be completing a project for their final assessment. End of course exams and vocational classes still have state tests, though. I don't know if they're ever really good tests, but they definitely won't be fair this year."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;AP courses have a nationally standardized measure - the exam. Dual credit courses do not, so top tier universities tend not to count them because they have no way to measure the quality of instruction; the university I went to was included in this. 

I wasn't attempting to argue otherwise. This does not mean that all schools universally accept AP credit simply because one took the College Board's exams. I would say that a great argument is to look no further than the debacle of last year's exams to see why many schools are beginning to balk at AP exams in regards to the questions of their equity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They allowed me to take a test to test out of English, but that was only one class out of many. My high school didn’t offer AP so I spent money on community college without realizing it wouldn’t transfer.  

And conversely, with regards to English, there are some universities which will only accept AP English Language as opposed to AP English Literature or vice-versa. This becomes even more varied when one considers certain majors/programs at certain schools will or will not accept AP results for certain exams. The most known school in my state meets all of these requirements and is a major reason why so many of our students end up opting to not take AP exams 2 weeks before it's time to test because they've found out they're accepted and realize the school doesn't take AP English Lit (the one we offer as opposed to Lang). Or - even better - they go into the test and dick around and score 1s and 2s since their score doesn't matter and because they don't think it impacts the teacher (God, I hate that!)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Our dual program currently has an agreement with local universities to transfer credit but the universities have not been impressed with the quality of student coming out of our dual program so even that is in jeopardy. 

Sadly, this may be more common than you think. However, in some cases there are also local CCs that provide superior instruction to bigger universities.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I try to counsel my students to research what credits their goal-universities will or will not take. My problem with the counselors is they sell dual as superior to AP when each has different pros and cons, and instead of focusing on the kids who would benefit from dual the most (the ones who want to go a non traditional route and work while doing CC then transferring later) they instead recruit the top 25% of the class (the AP kids) because they know they’ll be able to pass the exam for community college (when the counselors bother to tell them about it) without additional prep.  

I cannot speak to your counselors' rationale but one possible point of rationale they may have for suggesting Dual Enrollment over AP is to give students a more ""authentic"" collegiate experience. Many first generation college students drop out, not because they're incapable, but because they feel overwhelmed. Dual Enrollment can give an exposure that AP simply cannot. And also allow for the chance of a articulation agreement with guaranteed transfer to a 4-year state school, though not all states have this (I am only aware of CA, PA, DE, and NC at this point). That said, **I appreciate seeing a teacher such as yourself taking an active role in these conversations with students.** I wish some of my teaching staff would do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example, they convinced the valedictorian to drop AP for dual without bothering to check that her first choice school (an Ivy) won’t take dual credit. Like, they didn’t even ask, just assured her it would be better, and she had to change her schedule again when she found out. 

That is unprofessional on their part but I do wonder if some of their perspective dealt with a financial standpoint. Though I believe you said you're a Title I school so the valedictorian is likely to get merit and need-based aid covering much of an Ivy's tuition.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But it’s difficult when the counselors are making it this weird tug of war and telling kids, even the Valedictorian, that “they’re not going to pass the AP test anyway so Dual is a safer bet.” It’s just bizarre to me that they do this, not only because it can harm kids, but also when AP enrollment drops, so does the school’s state rating. 

That last sentence seems weird as in my state, Dual Enrollment and AP enrollment are treated equally in school report cards from the state. Honestly, I would say - if it hasn't happened - you and your counseling department definitely need to sit down and have a chat and see where both sides are coming from. It appears you both have the intent of doing what's best for the kids but maybe very drastically different paths in doing it. This is why I absolutely love my English department and love interacting with them to be honest, because they make every effort to be on the same page with me."

highschoolteachers,Thank you guys for the support and honest opinion. Do you guys think It will be hard to get a math teaching position in middle or high school?
highschoolteachers,"I'm looking for individual teachers to share their reading lists. I'm actually looking for middle school and high school reading lists. I would also like to ask the teacher that would be sharing some questions regarding the list and how much control they have, what district they are teaching in if that's ok, if they has control then why those books, etc"
highschoolteachers,I will talk to somebody about it. I won’t even bother transferring schools because it is my senior year and I’m graduating early. I’ve already been accepted to a few colleges so I hope my college experience is better than my high school experience
highschoolteachers,"I've taught all four grade levels of high school English.  Fyi book lists can vary greatly.  Some are state, district, or school mandated reading...some teachers have way more autonomy to choose for themselves (which is what I experienced for most of my years teaching English). Students reading Shakespeare for 3-4 of their years in high school is a norm though.

But yeah throw out some questions."
highschoolteachers,"When I started teach 12 years ago I got the high school students who were in elementary school when they decided phonics wasn't necessary and didn't teach it.  Those students struggled so bad in high school English, reading and technical writing."
highschoolteachers,"I've recently given high school a shot. Everything you say is true. They were respectful, polite, and my age was never questioned. Thanks for your advice. All the best."
highschoolteachers,"Your guidance counselor is the one who should help make the change, along with a push from mom. 

At least when I was in high school, my guidance counselor made my schedule and also had conferences with me about what I want to take. I hope they answer you!"
highschoolteachers,"There's multiple ways of looking at it, academically, socially, intellectually, etc. I think that, like other people have said, you see a lot of similar levels of achievement, because school is only one factor in a kid's life and, especially by the time they're in high school, their performance in school is, to a certain extent, already overdetermined by all of the other variables. Additionally, the idea that remote learning replaces in-person learning can be explained by the inadequacies of in-person learning. Another factor could just be that online learning is less efficient than in-person learning at imparting information and could be slower, but what's required of students is so low that that threshold becomes irrelevant. Adding to this, it really depends on so many other factors like how the online teaching is implemented, what age group, how are the students generally, etc."
highschoolteachers,"If you teach science, you could dress up as Aldrich Ames but with a mole nose and 6.02214076 x 10^23 written on your arm.


Credit to my chemistry teacher in high school. He was very proud of himself for that one. It was endearingly embarrassing."
highschoolteachers,I teach civics and straight up tell my kids I don’t discuss my personal views with students and two them I have the right to privacy. They dint ask anymore. I also make it clear that I will take the opposite stance that they take during certain projects and assignments so that they have to prepare for a bit of a debate and actually know their topic. I give them feedback right after they are done and try and be fair. So long as you are honest and up front they tend to handle it well. Parroting the parents happens all the way through high school for most of them
highschoolteachers,"I think that Montessori has a good framework. The idea of children being able to explore and create and being naturally driven to do so is both true but also doesn't account for outside factors. Students in title one schools who aren't regularly getting fed and have awful home lives aren't going to do the whole ""Montessori"" thing. They're going to go and just want to curl into a ball and hide from everyone and in a less structured environment very well may do so. There's also the fact that while everyone would agree that there is some baseline of educational achievement a student must do (for example, being able to comfortably and proficiently read at grade level) ultimately Montessori is fundamentally incompatible with most modern educational standards.

This is only accentuated when you realize that these kids aren't going to specialized Montessori middle and high schools. In fact, Maria Montessori has almost nothing written on Middle and High outside of ""middle schoolers are too impulsive and dumb to be expected to learn so your job is to give them something to do and wait for them to mature into high schoolers where they can be put into apprenticeships"" which is loaded with problems. There are also crippling issues with the fact that ultimately there hasn't been any kind of progress in this field in a century. Students from Montessori schools (unless parents are obscenely wealthy enough to afford private tutors and high tier private schools and such) are simply dumped right back into the local Public-Private school system where all of the things they had learned in Montessori (thinking critically, independent research) are punished ***harshly*** in pursuit of just teaching to standards and simply becoming an ""acceptable receptacle"" to learning. Thus, when students are put back into Public and Private schools, they end up even worse off than if they were just kept in a public elementary school anyways.

To be able to make Montessori work, either a.) some kind of major work has to be done on applying the ideals of Montessori education to difficult subjects and future-focused students and b.) there has to be infrastructure built around that. This means either, instead of having teachers, having experts in multiple fields who work at the school and help guide students along through difficult topics *or* teaching students email etiquette and how to read difficult works and such. Both of these have massive problems (hiring a team of experts both inevitably means that there are major knowledge gaps, while I am sure that professors and forerunners in their fields don't want to respond to an eighth grader's repeated attempts at asking what a quasar is and will write your school some very... colorful letters and emails if students are allowed to continue), along with the fact that by nature this is basically throwing most of the local educational systems to the side in support of a few private schools. Honestly, I'm still tempted to try and be that person to write a work on how to apply Montessori ideals practically to a classroom or at least create what I'd hope would become a standardized framework for Montessori in the classroom among middle and high schoolers, but that's Ph.D. level work."
highschoolteachers,"Had that happen to me when I was a high school student. No running water all day and we were expected to pour water from buckets to flush the toilets. A seriously bad day to be on my period! 

Sorry for what you’re going through. It’s ridiculous."
highschoolteachers,"Teaching has been my only career actually. By background I meant where I grew up actually lol. 

But yeah, they wanted us to do stuff like “sharing circles” on Monday mornings, and I knew that if anyone tried that in my hometown they’d have been laughed out of the building. 😂

Especially in high school. It’s like these professors approach all teaching as if every grade behaves like Kindergarten lol. High school students do NOT enjoy that cloying, condescending style that these professors try to push."
highschoolteachers,Our school is a public vocational high school and our admin fears if we actually listen to advice we will lose recruitment and hurt our numbers and funding
highschoolteachers,"He was not a student. I used child and will stand by it. While 18 is legally considered an adult in most countries and most US states, anyone who has spent time working in a high school will tell you that nearly every student there is still a child.   

This person wasn't old enough to have formulated their own ideals or beliefs, or have the capacity to truly think through the consequences of their actions - only the delusion that someone else's beliefs were their own. Most people at that age are still in the naive and invincible stage. Yes trial courts will disagree but they have charged pre-teens as adults. 

We're all saddened and frustrated with what happened but to act like this person was anything but a child, acting like a child is a gross mischaracterization."
highschoolteachers,"Except that our local public health experts did advise that based on our local data we should not be opening, but the state forced us to open anyway back in August under penalty of losing funding. As is they've still laid off hundreds of teachers in addition to not replacing hundreds of resignations because accommodations are not being made for teachers with health conditions (students can pick all virtual, teachers cannot, you do both at the same time). Class sizes are still mostly in the 30s in person like usual because it's cheaper to just pay fines than hire more teachers and ventilation is poor quality. We have almost 300 new cases just in our school district in the past two weeks alone.

Just because places are open doesn't mean things have been okay. Our state government simply will not allow any schools to close regardless of local conditions or what local medical experts say. Maybe some places are safe to open, but I'm tired of seeing over 100 deaths nearly every day in my state and everyone acting like that's okay just because over 200 a day were dying in July. But instead we're going full steam ahead with even sporting events allowed at full capacity (like 1500 spectators allowed at high school football games and college and pro can open fully). Why is that the priority over trying to actually lower community transmission to the point where school could actually be safe?"
highschoolteachers,"I'm sorry, but if a teacher needs to be reminded about empathy or to love their kids even when they act out, I have no idea what they're doing in the profession. This is so incredibly basic, it has no business being presented in a room full of licensed teachers. If there really is a problem with a teacher lacking empathy for their students, that needs to be addressed with that teacher, not the entire staff. 94% of the students at my school are POC. I find the video to be tone deaf. It's so upsetting to me that our ""solution"" to racial inequity is motivational talks and shitting on white people instead of actually talking about actions we can take to make a difference. 

My students live in a historically redlined neighborhood. They are overpoliced. Most of their parents did not go to college, let alone graduate high school. They are in poverty. To make matters worse, ""good"" schools in ""good"" neighborhoods depend on parent contributions to maintain and improve the school. This dependence ensures that well funded schools will stay well funded and underfunded schools will stay underfunded. Do you really think we're going to fix the problem by telling the people who have dedicated their lives to work with these kids day in and day out to be more empathetic?"
highschoolteachers,"Thank you! I'm just at a loss for what I could write under Tutor, knowing I only tutored one kid, and he was 8, while I'm hoping to teach high school (15-17 yo)... Also, the experience listed right below that, the ""French teacher"" position, was in fact to teach French to kindergarten and primary school-aged children, so I'm not sure if it would really be relevant either... The thing is, I've only started teaching kids who have a similar age to the high school kids I would like to teach in the future this summer (2020) (the English Teacher, and then the French Teacher position) which is why I have positions such as Radio Producer in the main section... I do have experience as a summer camp counsellor too, but again, all these positions that I held from 2016 to 2018 where I worked with children were with younger children and not with the age group I would like to teach. 

Also, I modified the years for privacy reasons, so in reality, everything is from 2016 to 2021."
highschoolteachers,"We call it out every year. Our past admin was useless and went by who she liked rather than who was competent. We had a leadership change so hopefully the counselors will be held accountable. Also I work at a Title 1 high school and all the kids get their AP exams for free, so there’s no cost to them for either AP or Dual. The reason I push AP is many out of state universities won’t accept CC credit, whereas almost all will take a high AP score. The other is Dual is not rigorous and the local universities that take it are constantly threatening to stop accepting the credit because kids with dual credit are not coming to college at a remedial level."
highschoolteachers,"Haha yeah I figured they will have time to debate things later in their education, but for now they just need to know how things work. Hopefully their government teachers still give them the ability to think for themselves though. Mine in high school would get in arguments with kids over which candidate they supported. That’s not the teachers place."
highschoolteachers,What I feel like I’m missing is access to high school appropriate data to analyze. I try to pull data that’s appropriate but it’s a serious time commitment and sometimes I just can’t find what I need. There are some websites that are offering more real data sets for high school students to analyze but they don’t have topics I need.
highschoolteachers,"I am also a high school English teacher, so I recognize that it’s possible to teach controversial and upsetting texts with the right amount of nuance and support, and I’m sure that you provide that. I love the idea of analyzing the concept of what it means to be a teenager across time and definitely want to incorporate that next time I teach CITR. 

That aside, I don’t think this is the year for 13RW. Suicides tend to cluster and if I lost a friend as a vulnerable high schooler in an uncertain time, I would already be considering the option. I think that even with nuance and support, 13RW is too much. 

What about beginning next week with a short story that might give you a little more time to flesh out a larger study of a novella or something? Or even watching a movie about modern teen life and analyzing that as a text? Maybe Love, Simon? That would really provide some additional content about how being a teen has changed in juxtaposition with the homophobia in CITR. 

I dunno. Just a few thoughts. CITR is my favorite book and I’m really intrigued by this unit, so I might have rambled a bit. Best of luck!"
highschoolteachers,My school won’t pay you to tutor. So I usually suggest the local high school might have some kids they can hire if a parent asks.
highschoolteachers,"I teach kinder. I have a student with 4 older siblings (2 in high school and 2 in elementary). They are all sharing the same hotspot, designed for 4 students to use not 5. Apparently the high school “ran out” and won’t give the family one, so they use the one given to the younger students. It’s not enough. We’re working to get them a second one. Also she has a younger sibling looks about 3-4 from what I’ve seen in the background. Mom is home helping them, but the reason she’s home is maternity leave and she’s due any day. I’m terrified what will happen to this poor girl once the baby is born. They barely get her to class as is between hot spot and so many children in the house. I just want to help her learn her letters."
highschoolteachers,"""Plus get an office where you can work"". Who has space like that? I don't get to choose my work space. I teach in a high school with 3000 students. Every single square inch is full every class period. 

During full remote teaching first quarter, I taught from one of the practice rooms off the band room. It was that or share my typical classrooms all the time. ""Get an office"" is not a luxury some people have."
highschoolteachers,She’s in high school so I PRAY she can handle the little buddy! Lol!!
highschoolteachers,"Had my first cheating incident today. I'm 26 and a second year teacher. I've really grown a backbone and some confidence over the past year, but I was still super nervous about my first time potentially punishing a high school kid. I've gotten to the point where I feel like a Real Adult with middle school kids, but high school kids sometimes seem like a weird in-between category where I don't like to flex my authority unless I really have to. Well, I really had to, and here's how it went down.

A kid was accused by two witnesses of using a note sheet. I pull him out of study hall, play omniscient cop, and he confesses to asking the kid next to him for some answers. Denies using the note sheet. Whatever. I have a confession, the details are less important. I tell him thank you for your honesty, I'm going to talk to the guy who helped you cheat, you can go back to study hall.

I psych myself up for round two and follow maybe a minute later to the same fucking study hall and ask his cheating partner to come with me. It's literally mind blowing they didn't like text each other or attempt to coordinate their stories during this time. It's even more mind blowing that after witnessing his friend mysteriously leave with a teacher and come back, then being asked by the same teacher if there's anything he needs to say about the test, the second kid didn't think that maybe the cat was out of the bag and he should acknowledge he has SOME idea what this might be about, even to say like, ""You probably suspect me and X of cheating but it's not what it looks like..."" He admits to it in the end after I tell him his friend confessed. His defense? ""I didn't cheat. I didn't use any of his answers. I was trying to be helpful.""

I told them I'll let you know on Monday what's going to happen. Talked to my admin, who was very supportive and basically said it's up to me, I can let them retake if I want, probably a good idea to contact parents.

I'm going to let them marinate over the weekend, then on Monday ask them to retake. (I kind of think they cheated on more portions than they admitted to, and the retake will make it clear if that's the case. I won't like...pursue it, but it will give me a better idea of how strongly to suspect future dishonesty.) And give them the choice of me writing an email to their parents, or writing it themselves. Honestly that part will feel like a punishment for me too, but it's the right thing to do (ugh). So I have to marinate over the weekend too. But they don't need to know that, because I'm the adult and my feelings are irrelevant.

Coincidentally, I had already promised the class a treat on Monday for those who did an optional fun assignment, and both of those guys did the assignment. So it's nice that I'll have that little tangible way to say, ""This won't affect how I treat you in class,"" without having to actually say it."
highschoolteachers,Our district lowered the requirement to just a high school diploma. We had several 18-19 year olds subbing this past semester in the high school 💀
highschoolteachers,"Yes, you're correct and I agree.  We knew that going in to the profession.  We knew it when we started college . We knew it when we started our teaching program and we knew it when we applied to get a teaching license or certificate. We knew it when we applied for 'teacher' at the school district.  It's not new.  Yes, in the United States salary does have the ""give-and-take"" connotation.  And that is a personal decision when choosing a profession and applied to be compensated with a salary wage.

I also think that third is a hidden truth or additional underlying reason for choosing to be a salary compensated educator.  The lengthy breaks, the path to administration, the work hours are parentally ideal, and many others. We knew about the low pay and the salary but I don't believe any of us consciously understood the gross lack of respect and value some people and places have and it spreads like abuse.  I did not realize how poorly educators are viewed and I don't want to say it but it must be a least a small variable in play, gender.  

I saw a post in this thread asking how many people have been called 'mom' or 'dad' or, when I was 28 , 'grandma'? Think about that. That's not an endearing to be called a parental pronoun. It almost equivalent to calling a penis your, my, a ""Johnson"". Nobody would want to accidentally call their boss mom or dad. Imagine a doctor calling the chief of medicine 'mom' or 'dad' or anyone calling a judge in court mom or grandpa.  I am pretty sure any judge would not take that favorably. Because it's degrading.  It's not degrading to be a mother to be a father or a grandparent because moms, dads, grandmas, are, were or will be a professional outside of being a parent. I don't understand how educators are trusted with the future, with other people's children, given full access to young minds and then valued so little.  

That's a messed up, ass backwards, goddamnit where the f@?k am I? Stupid, stupid system.

I chose education because I love education.  I was told that it wasn't financially wise to be a student for the rest of my life. The best choice for continuing in school and not pay for it was to become a teacher.  I also believed and now only dream of education being a entity that has a ""separation of church and state"". I believe that ork is a place for work.  I don't understand employers and businesses trying to integrate anything personal with work beyond a work philosophy.  That is the biggest waste of productivity invented.  It's devious  as a 'business' driven idea.  Devious and manipulative way to attract employees and customers, clients, etc. I don't know about your school but every school I've ever been in has Bible study available each week during lunch and the school districts here rent space from the neighboring churches. We invite them into our schools that we rent space from them as well. Good ole American ""separation of church and state.""

No wonder our language is messed up and difficult to learn and why education isn't valued and teachers are mocked as professionals. All our students grow up with misrepresentations, double meanings, convoluted definitions, idioms and hypocrites.

We've all heard I, you, we ""didn't get into for the money..."".  No, no I didn't.  I also didn't get into it to be treated like a babysitter with a high school diploma. And if we were paid at babysitter rate we wouldn't be complaining.  I don't understand how teaching is called a profession but not treating or viewed as one."
highschoolteachers,Texas it already is just a high school diploma. Most schools have two different pay rates one for subs with degrees and one for those without.
highschoolteachers,"I made everything into a Pear Deck when teaching virtually. If you aren’t familiar it makes Google Slides interactive. That way I could do something like explain a concept and then have each kid practice and I could look at their work. I also got a lot of use out of cold calling on students. I teach high school so I’m not sure if that’s appropriate for elementary, but it helped it seem more like in person class, and it helped them stay engaged."
highschoolteachers,"I also blame parents when it comes to cell phone use. Many parents either ignore screen time because it serves as a babysitter or because they are addicted to phones (and the drama) themselves. 

Obviously, compared to high school 30 years ago (me) there's a whole new undercurrent of communication going on due to smartphones being instantly-accessed mini computers, cameras AND telephones. In class the phones are used for""passing notes"" texts, and sharing. Kids want to create and see videos and selfies, and they love to gossip. There are games to play, for God's sake. It's like bringing the telephone, tv, pinball arcade games, and the shopping mall to class. Of course they're distracted. The things on their phones are more interesting than class.

The addiction to phones is real. Not just the content, but the actual screen time process is addictive to the brain. The teens I taught with phones don't know anything  different and the school won't take away the phones. I see it like this. The schools know they are dealing with addiction, and some kids will go through serious withdrawals, so they can't act. It's like the reasoning, which is fair, that liquor stores during the pandemic had to stay open or ERs would be flooded with alcoholics going through DTs.

Don't get me started on parents who call their kids in class..."
highschoolteachers,Are you high school or elementary?
highschoolteachers,"Gotcha. Thanks for the answer.

As I said to someone else in the thread, as a high school teacher, I don't give a crap about ""skills"". I can teach skills. But I need kids who can turn in assignments and are willing to think."
highschoolteachers,"Yup.  All through elementary and middle school it didn’t matter a bit if you got straight Fs on your report card.  You _might_ catch some grief from your parents if they were on the ball (but so many parents are essentially absent) 

Then bang, in high school it’s suddenly very very real.  If a kid takes longer than one semester to figure this out, and many do, he’s not going to graduate.  To no one’s surprise, he’ll drop out at 18."
highschoolteachers,"I’m not sure at a kindergarten level, but as a high school teacher I see this a lot with freshmen as up until 9th grade, a lot of them have been socially promoted to stay with their peers, even when they should be held back.

So they ignore my constant warnings that if they fail this semester of math, they will need to retake it next year.

They tend to start learning at sophomores in a freshmen math class"
highschoolteachers,I'm an in-person high school teacher and I sometimes don't even respond to the parents who only magically give a crap when it's the last week of the quarter. All parents have access to updated grades online all of the time. There are no excuses.
highschoolteachers, Was virtual all 2020/2021 school year as a preschool teacher. Switched to high school and we are masked and I’m vaccinated and haven’t caught and neither have my own two children.
highschoolteachers,"I'm not a teacher, but I was a coach for flagline for a few years at a high school. Now our high school ran on block scheduling, and our marching bands were separated into freshman and varsity. Varsity flagline was something the kids had to try out for at the end of the previous school year - freshman flagline was open for any freshman student to participate. 
All incoming freshman at one time or another recieved information regarding band camp, usually the week before school started. A mom of a freshman student emailed one of the band directors, not me, asking about how to involve her child with flagline. The director gave her the information she needed, and told her that if she had other questions to email me. The mom did, she asked me about equipment she could get her daughter (unnecessary since we supply all equipment, but many students choose to buy their own), and possibly things the kid could work on over the summer. So I email her back with links of the standard equipment kits and YouTube links of basics - no big deal.
Flash forward to the first week of school. 
I get a RAGING email from this mother about how we did NOT reach out to her about band camp and that her daughter was just SO upset when she saw the band practicing during the first week of school. How we also didn't tell her that her kid had to be signed up for band class in order to participate. And now it was just TOO LATE for her daughter to join now because she would already be so behind (not really). They wasted so much money on equipment that would be useless now.
She was so rude and nothing I said seemed to matter. I told her how her student could talk to a counselor and get her schedule changed and jump right in. Nope. I told her I would buy the equipment from her. Nope. 
The email was ended with something of ""I'm disgusted, you would think you would be trying to get kids to join your program but I guess not"" 
Annnnnd it just goes to show, parents don't read emails very well."
highschoolteachers,"Funny visual: 3 high school age classes combined into a cafeteria setting, and an 18 year old high school graduate is the sub."
highschoolteachers,"Most school have all the life skills you speak of through the various elective classes. If you want to learn to do taxes, there’s a class. If you want to learn cooking, there’s a class. They’re not required like English, math, history, and science, but schools also are not in the business of parenting. Life skills are home skills. You learn the core content at school because it’s about expanding your brain and learning critical thinking skills. Kids are not any stupider than I was in high school 100 years ago. In fact, they’re smarter. They know things that I didn’t until I was well into my 20s. The access to information via the internet (good and bad) helps them learn (good and bad). As for making right or wrong choices, it’s always the same, no matter the generation. Also education now is far more engaging than my high school experience."
highschoolteachers,"Any teacher who shits on working class jobs loses the right to complain about people in higher paying jobs shitting on them. Most students will at least temporarily work such jobs regardless of academic performance. I remember being so surprised in my first teenage minimum wage job that most of my coworkers were adults, nearly all had graduated high school, and many had graduated college and concluded that many of my teachers didn't understand the working world outside of teaching jobs."
highschoolteachers,"I honestly can't fathom the idea of online kindergarten. Like... It's kindergarten. I think I had half days when I was that age. It's babysitting so mom can do at least part time work. Isn't it??? Times have changed since I was in school. 

This isn't to say that your work is by any means lesser than that of a grade or high school teacher. It's all glorified babysitting all the way down. But. Like. It's. Kindergarten. I think we'll survive if Billy can't get through the semesters content."
highschoolteachers,"Already happening. Some states are considering letting lunch ladies, janitors, bus drivers, and other school staff sub in classes. Some districts already allow high school graduates to sub."
highschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade and my school has started a ""how to high school"" classes during homeroom to get them caught up to speed on credits, cumulative GPA, different academic pathways, etc.  I'm sure most of it will fly over some of their heads."
highschoolteachers,"Pretty much. 

I didn’t get it until last month… I worked at a ski resort, a liquor store, and in a fairly large high school as a sub and never got it through all of that. I didn’t get it while sleeping right next to my wife who had it before all the vaccines and stuff. I honestly thought I was immune."
highschoolteachers,I had to explain to my freshman students how semester grades and gpa and class credits work before break. I know they are freshman and it’s really their first time with these things being a bigger deal but you would think there would a basic “here’s how high school works” meeting for incoming students
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching high school for 19 years, and I am wasted. Just worn down and blah. I plan to TRY reading new novels and other literature so I don't seem so bored to the students. I know my lack of enthusiasm is a wet blanket, so I'm tossing the old standbys and hoping it will refresh me and interest them. I have former students who message me on Facebook about how they miss me and my classes and that they were fun...I would be embarrassed for them to see me teach lately. I need some inspiration and energy."
highschoolteachers,"Our 8th &amp; 9th grade teams piloted this.  My daughter was a sophomore and immediately said, ""Then I only have to do 10% of the work to pass.""  Our 9th grade English teacher noted that her students turned in poorer quality work under the 50% policy.

I find, after a term of many assignments (40+), that students' grades move very little, even if I weight their final project at 25% of their grade.  A student who typically scores an 85% is still at 85% at the end of the term even if they have a few 0s.

50% sounds like lowering expectations.  I realize this is an educational trend that has been implemented in some geographic areas, and that some researchers are saying it's for ""equity,"" but it really rubs me the wrong way in its wrongness.  It feels like grade inflation.

Is the student proficient with the subject material?  It's hard for me to feel like my kid who came 45 minutes late to first period with me every day and who turned in 6 assignments out of 45 (true story) should earn high school credit for my biology class.  If you talk to her, she's really not. She knows from sitting in my classroom that biology involves microscopes and skeletons, but she could not tell you anything meaningful about our major units of study this past term:  how life is defined, originated, and evolved, biological molecules, cellular structure and function, or metabolism, or how any of that relates to her own body or medical or space research, or how our taxes support all that.  So why should she pass?  We would be graduating her as ignorant as when she entered my class in September.  What does it mean for a high school to allow kids to slide through to that 60% bar with a 50% boost?

I went to the counselor about this kid, because I like her.  The counselor said, ""DHS is already involved, she's a very angry kid, the family life is chaotic, we won't see her graduate, the only way she's going to get healthy is by leaving that house, if her mom would just sign the papers for Job Corps she could be out of there and getting some skills.  So just continue supporting her by creating a welcoming environment.""

Meanwhile, 67% of our entering freshman class this year required remedial math, some with skills that rate at the level of kindergarten/1st grade.  They have arrived at high school AND CAN'T EVEN ADD OR SUBTRACT.  That's not simply the effects of the pandemic.  That is YEARS of systemic failure."
highschoolteachers,"For 2 reasons:

1) parents always assume that it's going to be the same as how they remember it, despite the fact that was years ago and things change. And their memory is really shitty. So they don't listen to anything that contradicts their assumptions.

2) it's how an unreasonably large number of people live their lives and our culture has begun to value it more.  Start looking around and notice how much procrastination culture has taken over. Look at people joking about doing things last minute. Look at how many people are late to things and act like that's normal and not rude at all. Look at how much people will proudly and loudly put things off until later because it doesn't *have* to be done right now.

As a society we have begun to ""deal with"" things by refusing to look at them, like a toddler pouting in the corner. This thing stresses me out, I'll just do it later. I don't want to, I'll just do it later. I don't like it, I'll do it later. ...Well, surprise, surprise, if it isn't the consequences of our own actions...

We then make it worse with policies like letting kids turn in horribly late work at full credit. Sure, you've shown me you now have the skill of identifying a metaphor, but what about the skill of getting your damn act together? What about the skill of planning ahead? (For kindergarten kids, that's 100% on the parents. I'm not saying to penalize a kid for the parents, but by the time they're in high school, they need to get their personal responsibility together).

Even my dear wonderful husband who is pretty much the best person in the whole wide world. I had to spend a lot of energy in our relationship to get across that when I say ""we should leave by noon"" that I mean ""we should be ready, in the car, and pulling out of the driveway no later than exactly noon."" It would be 11:59 and I'd be standing at the door, and he'd be like ""I'll get ready."""
highschoolteachers,I had a sub in high school that said more or less the same. He took a typing class in high school instead of a fun elective he had looked forward to taking and because he learned to type he got to run the typewriter in Vietnam instead of being on the front lines.
highschoolteachers,"I do teach math, though I did teach high school history, psychology, and sociology a long time ago. It was more work then, but there wasn't any of these online programs I use now. The kids in high school where I teach do little writing and mostly multiple choice tests, and our school has the best scores in the multi-county region. 

I've even heard talk among teachers about why we teach writing so much. This was official vertical team official talk, not gossip. They went on and on about how so many jobs require zero writing. They aren't wrong. I didn't chime in because it didn't affect me though."
highschoolteachers,Middle school and even high school
highschoolteachers,"Do you want them to only work for a reward or expect something all the time? Go for it. 
My advice after 13 years in high school ELA, skip ""rewarding"" behavior. Public acknowledgment of good behavior is great, but rewards don't work. Game prizes, cool. Extra credit, even better. Those are natural reward structures that are built on performance goals and work ethic. 
Focus on developing great guiding questions and thoughtful writing prompts. Avoid a skills-based approach to teaching ELA.  
Want them to engage? Convince them of why literature is valuable: because it provides insight into the world's that others experience, teaches us more about ourselves and gives us a window into worlds we could never experience on our own. Teach them the. Alien and universality of story telling. Then pick stories that are connected on a central theme. Let your prompts explore questions related to that theme. Then teach skills based on what you observe in their writing and that will contextualize the otherwise pointless lessons and they'll see the value in it and they'll learn something
 
Ignore all the chintzy stuff that you think is clever and all the advice you're getting, tbh. Read, write, talk, think, feel, listen, have them create. Anything else is window dressing."
highschoolteachers,"Wife, daughter and I have all stayed healthy so far. Wife teaches early elementary, I’m high school, and daughter is in preschool."
highschoolteachers,"Nope, not that I know of, although it’s possible I had a very mild or asymptomatic case because the testing they offer for us is hard for me to do because I have to get my own kids to school at that time. 

I’m in a very crowded, urban high school with a low student vaccination rate. I think that cases will be high  when we go back next week and I’m thinking not if but when. 

I am boosted and my kids (6 and 10) are fully vaccinated. I just focus on what I can do, rather than what’s out of my control."
highschoolteachers,"It has only happened once, although I just turned 40 and teach high school so I anticipate more in the future. My reaction was 🥰 It made me feel like they knew how much I cared about them."
highschoolteachers,"Let me guess.  Middle school? When I first got into teaching, it was traumatic. I was always with the popular group in my own high school years so it shocked me how these kids would read me. Like “tf. I just met you, you little shit”.  But I started to work on myself spiritually and really realize that as a teacher, I have the power to create the world I want to live in. I can create joy, love and peace. Now, I freely and openly compliment my students about their style, their intelligence, their resilience, etc. I have also learned to take their insults as jokes. “Why yes, I do think I’m all that with my oompa-looking ass 😂”.  To last, we really do need to develop thick skin. It helps to know that these insults come from a dark place and from their own deep insecurities. It’s up to us to allow kindness to shed light and love. Also, if you are in middle school, it just is a hell hole.  Switching to high school where there are actual natural consequences for those who take things to far is a big plus."
highschoolteachers,"I haven't, but teach high school. My mom who teaches kindergarten has been called mom though"
highschoolteachers,"That’s perfect. But you didn’t try to force him to be a particular kind of reader or exert this huge effort to make him love reading. You met him where he was and let him do his thing. I teach high school English and often kids don’t like writing. I tell them, and honestly believe myself, that not everyone has to love everything academic. It’s ok to hate it. Doesn’t make you anything but human. But also, it’s legit a skill you need. One day you might have a story you want to tell, or you might need to talk to someone in power in a way they can understand. Writing is your voice. You need a voice because you need power. I’m passionate about writing. But it’s ok if my kids aren’t. I take them where they are. I require them to try and do a real essay, their essay, not some cut and paste BS, but I give them space to feel what they feel. If they just want to pass and get it over with, I let them be for the most part while still doing my thing."
highschoolteachers,"My previous school had parents as volunteer subs, until a YouTube video of kids making each other pass out in class with said parent subs made the rounds 🤦🏼‍♀️ our school cost 10k/year for high school students and wouldn't secure adequate subs, absolutely embarrassing 😳"
highschoolteachers,"Never thought it would be an issue for me teaching high school but it has twice in my four years. Funniest part, was the fact that only one of the two called me Dad... That poor other kid."
highschoolteachers,"Each state is different and I just got lucky with how things aligned.  Then again, where I live now, substitute teachers no longer require a license or anything more than a high school diploma."
highschoolteachers,"I don't know when it became commonplace for kids to be tuned into their peers inner thoughts 24/7 ... but it's definitely not making kids smarter.   


I didn't get my son a phone until he was 16. He was one of maybe two kids throughout middle school and two full years of high school without a phone. He can also have actual conversations with people too."
highschoolteachers,"It's happened a few times (I teach high school). One of the times, it became a running joke for half of the school year."
highschoolteachers,I teach a few sections of a high school science class and recently started doing standards based grading and only grading quizzes and assessments. I only have maybe 5 students who struggle with doing work because it’s not graded. But at the same time- I do think they would struggle even IF the work was graded. They seem to lack motivation at large. But I am happy that the majority seem to do it because they recognize that not doing it means they aren’t practicing for their assessments. It’s only the stragglers now 🤷🏼‍♀️
highschoolteachers,"I got 'mommy' once. 
I teach high school. 
It was hilarious."
highschoolteachers,"I dunno what kind of subbing you're used to, but grades K -6 usually have you teaching the teacher's lessons.   It's typically only high school that's babysitting.  Teachers don't trust that a sub knows anything about biology or calculus or any focused topic.  I did end up having to learn a process again in math in a high school class to help students one time though....  I hate math."
highschoolteachers,"As much as I have tried, I just cannot make myself be okay with any “minimum” grade. Maybe this is insensitive of me. The purpose of school is supposed to prepare students for life. If students are not taught that they can fail if they do not put forth effort, some may be inclined to leave high school thinking they can do nothing and be just fine. Students should be given chances to make up missing assignments, but I just can’t see any way that handing out a passing grade to a kid who did nothing is healthy. 

Failure may not be possible in some schools, but it is 100% possible in life after school, and if we do not teach students that they can fail, they will inevitably be set up to fail.

It also has the potential to create a snowball effect of illiteracy that leaves teachers at each grade level with an even higher hill to climb to get these students educated."
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, I just stopped caring about this. Yes, I think a student that does nothing should get a zero. But if giving them 50% by default makes my life easier... I'm also in middle school, not credit-bearing high school classes, so take my thought with a grain of salt."
highschoolteachers,"The purpose of Government is set forth in [The U.S. Constitution: Preamble](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/preamble/preamble-overview


&gt;""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""

These are not Rights or Powers, but the guidelines to decide should ""We the People"" do this?

Of these purposes of government  Promote the General Welfare, Education for All is square in the sights of this point.

John Adams [wrote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0232) a bit about the importance of payment for service and education in a democracy.

&gt;I want a service which is worth something, I am able and willing to Pay for it. I will not lay myself under any obligation to you by accepting your Gift. I will owe you no gratitude any further than you serve me faithfully the obligation and Gratitude Shall be from you to me, and if you do not do your Duty to me I will be perfectly free to call you to an account and to punish you and if you will not accept of Pay for your service you shall not serve me

This is from the middle of the letter on the topic of payment for public services. Specifically he goes on about payment of elected officials, but I think we can assume the same principle includes all public servants. Payment for service should allow a life of dignity.

&gt;the social science will never be much improved untill the People unanimously know and Consider themselvs as the fountain of Power and untill they Shall know how to manage it Wisely and honestly. reformation must begin with the Body of the People which can be done only, to affect, in their Educations. **the Whole People must take upon themselvs the Education of the Whole People and must be willing to bear the expences of it.** there should not be a district of one Mile Square without a school in it, not founded by a Charitable individual but maintained at the expence of the People themselvs they must be taught to reverence themselvs instead of adoreing their servants their Generals Admirals Bishops and Statesmen

Here he makes clear the importance of the People being an integral part of the system. It gives us ownership of our own destiny together.

The rest of the letter John Adams wrote to John Jeb is absolutely fantastic. He goes on to discuss why it's important to create a system that makes people like Martin Luther King jr, Susan B Anthony, Carl Sagan, and Mr Rogers, although he references others like Washington. Good leaders should not be a product of the time, but of the educational system and culture of the people. If a country doesn't make good leaders then when that leader is gone there's no one to replace them and that culture and movement dies with them.

&gt;Instead of Adoring a Washington, Mankind Should applaud the Nation which Educated him. If Thebes owes its Liberty and Glory to Epaminondas, She will loose both when he dies, and it would have been as well if She had never enjoyed a taste of either: but if the Knowledge the Principles the Virtues and Capacities of the Theban Nation produced an Epaminondas, her Liberties and Glory will remain when he is no more: and if an analogous system of Education is Established and Enjoyed by the Whole Nation, it will produce a succession of Epaminandas’s.

In another short work by John Adams, [Thoughts on Government](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Government), [YouTube Reading](https://youtu.be/XIw_BItRLfs), he wrote about the importance of a liberal education for everyone, spared no expense.
&gt;Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/pdwq01/ill_just_put_that_on_your_calendar_for_when_youre/hat7pr6?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) is a comment I saw in response to someone complaining about having to take courses outside their area of study to get a bachelor's degree. So much of our population's perspective towards the education system is solely driven towards financial gain and not about personal growth in community alongside financial gain.

&gt;I’m now a college professor in bio, but when I was a grad student I was the teaching assistant for a basic bio course aimed at engineers. The first question I got in lab section was “Yeah, why do I have to take this course when I don’t give a shit about biology and won’t use it as an engineer.” I said, “the political discourse right now is full of discussions that center on biology, such as reproductive rights, climate change, etc. If you don’t understand the biological concepts enough to be part of that conversation, we are going to have it without you, and you will be at someone else’s mercy. But if you think being informed on decisions that affect your life is a waste of time, go ahead and phone it in.” You could’ve heard a pin drop after.

&gt;College educations should be affordable (or free) so that taking non-core classes aren’t a financial burden, but receiving a well-rounded education that exposes you to more than just your specific, narrow subject is not the villain.


Then there's the [story](https://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/harris-rosen/) of Harris Rosen

&gt;Having had his own life so radically transformed by education, Rosen knew that this was an area he wanted to focus on, and Tangelo Park was the place.

&gt;Tangelo Park is built on land once used for orange groves. Originally built as housing for workers at the nearby Martin Marietta, it has become an isolated residential area. There are few services nearby for residents, and few public transit options. African Americans comprise 90 percent of the community, with many living below the poverty line.

&gt;“I fell in love with the neighborhood,” says Rosen. “I knew I wanted to do some type of scholarship program for them.”

&gt;The Tangelo Park Program, started in 1993, gives every neighborhood child age 2 to 4 access to free preschool. Parents have access to parenting classes, vocational courses and technical training.

&gt;For a program that took just one hour and four people to develop, the impact has been wide and deep. Tangelo Park Elementary is now a grade-A school. Every high school senior graduates.

&gt;But there’s more. Much more.

&gt;Every high school graduate who is accepted to a Florida public university, community or state college, or vocational school receives a full Harris Rosen Foundation scholarship, which covers tuition, living and educational expenses through graduation.

&gt;Nearly 200 students have earned Rosen scholarships, and of those, 75 percent have graduated from college—the highest rate among an ethnic group in the nation.

Imagine if we did this and more on a national scale. 

The benefit of a promoted liberal educated society regardless of sex, orientation, ability, class, race, socioeconomic status, etc., is that it just promotes good democracy in prosperity."
highschoolteachers,"Mom happened several times when I worked in elementary. I had one who would slip and call me Mamaw (he lived with her) but since she was a very attracted woman I took it as a compliment lol

Now that I’m with high school I get a lot of Mama D or Bestie."
highschoolteachers,"Oh, all the time. I'm a woman. I teach 1st grade. I love them and take it as a compliment. They are young, so they see me as a caregiver and trusted adult. I love it. 

My husband teaches high school SPED (behavior kids) and he just said his students have called him ""Dad"" too. He takes it as a compliment--it's a good sign when his kids feel that comfortable with him and see him as a nurturing role in their life--he has reallllly difficult kids."
highschoolteachers,"Just curious…are you male or female? How long have you been teaching? What grade level?


I find that males tend to have a stronger presence (in my opinion). I am female, been teaching 15 and a half years, high school. I almost typed that I’ve never been told that I have a strong presence but I just remembered being told that toward my earlier years of teaching. I never knew what it meant either! LOL"
highschoolteachers,"Lmao I subbed in CA and got my certification in TX. Imagine .y shock when I learned that all you need to be a sub in TX is a high school diploma and maybe a pulse. 

The school I used to work at literally recruits subs from assisted living homes lol"
highschoolteachers,"Never in my modest 2 years as a teacher. It was a high school though, it’s less likely I guess."
highschoolteachers,"LOL, I mean midterm testing in high school"
highschoolteachers,"I’m an SLP, but have felt anxious this entire break. I work with high school students with moderate-severe disabilities, and many kids who can’t tolerate wearing a mask. We’ve gotten almost daily emails about new Covid cases from staff over break. I’ve had a lot of trouble sleeping this break, and am worried about what the next month will be like. I also don’t feel like my school will go remote, even with almost no staff. Everyone is very burnt out and overwhelmed with the uncertainty. I’m not calling out Monday, but I do have to take a day off next week to interview for another district (supposed to be an in-person interview, but maybe remote, at the last minute)."
highschoolteachers,"Male teacher here. I've been called dad a couple of times and on one notable occasion been told I have ""suburban white mom energy. But in like, a good way"". Teaching high school is wild."
highschoolteachers,I have gotten it from both my middle and high school students.
highschoolteachers,"This is weird to me, because as teachers, we give students homework. We ask them to “work outside work hours”. Additionally, I spent my entire life so far doing homework, for high school, and the past four years at college. When i am a teacher next fall, is it really realistic for me to suddenly ditch doing “homework”? Also, since its going to be my first year, wont i have to spend my nights/summer preparing lesson plans?"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I don't think I've gotten ""mom"" by accident, or if I have it's rare. But I have kind of a lot of students who've called me mom intentionally. I have snacks and I listen, so I do it to myself, really."
highschoolteachers,Male high school teacher. Kids endearingly call me mom. It’s great haha
highschoolteachers,"Being a teenager  has always been  rough for everyone.  ""Get over it"" is the reality of adult life, whether you think that is for good or ill.  It is the way of most of the world.  They are supposed to, by high school, be getting ready to assume adult life and all its responsibilities, legally at age 18 .  That includes doing what you are supposed to do even when you are feeling not so fresh.  Prolonging their feeling like children does them no favors."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a substitute teacher who started substitute teaching while in grad school, I graduated last year and no longer find the work appealing because I know how much I'm being exploited while I work in lieu of regular full time teachers. It's more cost efficient to keep subs around because the most they could earn on their regular rate is 36k at my district, assuming they work all days. I thought I would transition into full-time teaching, however, that has changed and the honeymoon phase is over. I was making more before I held any degree working a blue collar job out of high school. The cost of going to school to get a degree in a field that pays little is a slap to the face, and it's the altruistic students who see the appeal of being a teacher. I wouldn't mind my pay if school districts at least provided some form of subsidized housing with an agreement at the state or federal level, since these kinds of districts aren't willing to pay us enough to cover the cost of living."
highschoolteachers,Maryland specifically St. Mary’s county. Subs are paid on tiered system high school diploma only is the lowest paid and it goes up from there.
highschoolteachers,"You may want to look at the schools certified by the [AEFE](https://www.aefe.fr/), they are French schools in countries all over the world.  My school is part of their system although I'm a local teacher so my requirements and the way I was hired is different than for a French national.  

You'd have to refer to their hiring process, but I from what I understand the classroom teachers all need to be certified in France (or perhaps locally) and all I know have taught in France for a couple years before going abroad.  I'm not sure if having taught in France is a requirement or just what my colleagues did though.  It is possible that with the current teacher shortage they may consider hiring someone who doesn't have a teaching credential, but it may not work out to be a long-term position past this teacher shortage.  I know people who have subbed for our school without a credential (usually parents) and I could see them hiring someone like that as a long-term sub for the year if they are short teachers.  

If you don't have a teacher's certification you could work as a classroom assistant.  My school has classroom assistants who are all either French nationals or from other French-speaking countries and do not have a teaching credential.  However, at least at my school, assistants work only with preschool-kindergarten, or petite section-grande section in the French system (maternelle).  I'm not sure if this age group suits you, it is very different from primary grades let alone middle and high school (college and lycée)."
highschoolteachers,"It happens even in high school, :D"
highschoolteachers,"I want to teach in the USA, currently teaching in the U.K., but I need more years of practice before I can apply. Also, it’s really hard to find jobs for a teacher like me (French, German high school/middle school) since the subjects aren’t in demand. 

Although I’m starting to think it might be a really bad idea! Teaching in the U.K. is already pretty poor, I currently earn like 27k and if I move regions next year I’ll take a pay cut to 25k."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, and since I was a student teacher (I was 21 when I started student teaching) I’ve always gotten called mom or mother in multiple languages (Arabic French Portuguese etc), multiple times a day and I’m always still shocked. 

I’m not old looking (I’m 24 rn) and get mistaken for a student daily so whenever I hear 15-18 year olds call me mom, I just laugh. Usually makes the kids feel less awkward &amp; embarrassed. 

But it makes me go “wtf I’m not even OLD” when they say it."
highschoolteachers,"Happens at least once a year.  My name starts with an M so this may help in the confusion I think, but I think it's pretty normal.  I teach littles so they may do it more often than older kids, but I remember doing it in high school to a teacher, I was mortified."
highschoolteachers,"That's what my supervising teacher said when I volunteered at a high school. She said as long as I set boundaries from the start, I should be okay. Thank you for your advice. It's something I'll have to work on as conflict is something I try to avoid at all times"
highschoolteachers,"I think at 21 teaching high school will the greatest challenge.  Being so close to their age, they might consider you as a peer and not listen to you.  Set clear boundaries and stick to them.  Give a warning and a final warning.  If you are still being undermined, don’t be afraid to ask for help from the office or another teacher."
highschoolteachers,"I teach lower elementary so it's quite different than middle or high school, but I try to limit the amount of technology I use.  This is particularly important as they had so much screen time during shutdowns, but I also need to balance having them become comfortable with some technology tools incase we have a shutdown again.  Plus, using technology is a life skill they'll need, so it's finding the balance that works best for you and your class.

I do have an app for reading online which is great because it gives them such a large variety of books to choose from, but I also give them time where they read physical books, too.  I also have an app I can do a lot of grammar practice on which is great because it's corrected automatically and they're given explanations of their mistakes in real time.  But, I think it's also important to actually physically do exercises both for physical memory of writing answers as well as having a break from screen time.  

Our 5th graders all have their own laptops which can be great, but some teachers are finding they're being used too much and kids are loosing the ability to focus as long without them.  My 5th grade English colleague has been having the kids do their writing mostly on paper to give them a break from screen time and so they don't loose the skills that come with physically writing.  Again it's finding the balance and not just using one format all the time.  

Everyone learns differently and some may learn well with technology while others are like OP and find they learn better using pencil and paper."
highschoolteachers,"I wore long sleeves for a long time, mostly cardigans. My most notable scars are on my upper arms so with short sleeved tops it was hit or miss if they would show. After a few years I stopped always hiding my scars (especially since my new classroom can get really hot and I’d rather be comfortable) and just wear whatever with no thoughts, though a lot of my scars have faded and some I’ve tattooed over. I’m also in a much better place personally and more confident in my teaching, which I think also played a role in how I feel about my scars.

I only had one student ever ask me about them in my third year teaching, and I just side-stepped it. I teach high school, so my interactions with parents face to face where they could see my scars is pretty low. None of my coworkers have ever said anything. 

As for students, it could be triggering, but they could also see someone who has self-harmed but also continued on. 

In the end, teaching is really hard, especially student teaching. Do what you feel comfortable doing to start out, and go from there.

Good luck on your student teaching :)"
highschoolteachers,"Just watched an Inside Edition where they are training high school students, many without a driver’s license to be truck drivers to fill in for the shortage."
highschoolteachers,"I get time during their classes like art/music/pe, but some of that is walking, so it's more like 35 minutes. And lunch is about 22 minutes of silent eating time. Compare that to high school teachers who get 90 minutes every day of absolutely uninterrupted time plus a real 30 for lunch plus they never have to walk a class anywhere or do recess. I wish they could find a way to do that for elementary. Just make it contractual and force them to just figure it out."
highschoolteachers,"Not accidental, but my old high school students used to just call me mom. I had food and hygiene necessities in my classroom so they joked that I was the mom teacher and that just stuck the rest of my time there 😅"
highschoolteachers,"Uncertified people with only a high school diploma can sub in your state???

What the hell state is that? I'm not looking down on folks without a college degree but damn, a sub should have some kind of higher education, even if it's two years at a community college. Otherwise, we're treating schools like summer camp.

Then again, maybe that's the problem after all. We're treating school like a camp where it's basically a 7-hour day of supervising children rather than actually *teaching* them anything."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with your pluses and minuses for high school! Many of the kids have a fixed mindset and it sometimes is hard to teach them. My principal and assistant principal have been so kind, patient, and good to me that it kind of makes it hard to go, but my heart is telling me middle school 😅"
highschoolteachers,"Yes, I was certified in MS Math and I can’t remember what the school website said under vacancies (whether it said ‘Secondary Math Teacher’ , ‘MS Math Teacher’ , or ‘HS Math Teacher’) but I applied for the job. At the end of the interview the principal persuaded me to teach high school. I work for a public school district and we have two middle schools 6-8 and two high schools 9-12."
highschoolteachers,"I read most every comment and feel that the exact reason that teachers need to be paid more has not been stated. The reason teachers need to be paid more is so that we can draw better talent into the profession.

highschoolteachers,"""Don't worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.""

To me it's a very powerful quote and I think a lot of high school students lose some sense of perception. 

I like your quote. ""What you permit is what you promote."" Very succinct and so very true."
highschoolteachers,"This is a difficult topic to broach.

Your description almost makes it sound like your expectations are a far-gone dream.

I would say the only saving-grace that you have is that the teacher is **you** and not your mentor. When I was student teaching and we had the shift it was obvious. The students actually surprised me and saw me as the new teacher and with that came new procedures.

The problem is that my mentor was excellent when it came to classroom management. When I came in I kept pretty much the same rules in place and handled them in the same manner. It worked. You will have to start out knowing that you're going to have issues, but keep in mind that you can slowly chip away at them over time.

I can give you some tips:

**Don't offer incentives**: By ""incentives"" I mean something like candy. Or a drawing for a prize (at that age they won't like the cheap stuff enough like 7 year olds do). You'll go bankrupt from this alone. And it can be a pain to keep track of the incentives given.

**Call them out, respectfully**: Most students will respond to being call out by continuing to misbehave. It's usually because you did it wrong. Don't just call their name and say something along the lines of ""shame on you"". For high school students I can usually say ""Tom. Please stop talking you're being rude to me and everyone else."" For **me** that tends to work. I'm telling them what's wrong, how they can fix it and giving them perspective [Why is it wrong?].

**Have rules and stick to them**: If there are no rules then create them. If you think it's applicable then *they* can create the rules. If the rules are broken then deal with it. If you have a rule being broken 20 times a day then stick to it. I find that the first 2 weeks of school tend to be crazy. I'm getting onto 4-5 people in each class each day, but eventually the numbers dwindle. They start to understand the rules are in place and I'm stickin' with 'em.

**Don't be too friendly**: By this I mean don't go out of your way to be kind to the students. I do this. I'm *respectful* to my students. I greet them with a smile. I like most of my students just fine, but I'm not going to be relaxed with them. I don't make lessons hard (that's silly), but I expect them to do it. If a student isn't working or is being disrespectful I redirect them and eventually chew them out. If they don't have an IEP or the like then they should be working.

In my mind, if they aren't doing what I'm asking and what I'm asking isn't out of the way then they are being rude. If I spent 4-5 hours creating a weeks worth of lesson plans and activities then I want them working on them. If they are rude to me then I chew them out.

**Parents**: I don't know the situation here. If you can contact parents then it is helpful. Generally, parents will let their kid know that you got into touch with them. This can go a long way.

**Proximity**: One last thing. At the end of your post you mentioned a few ways to deal with classroom management and I just wanted to give another. Proximity is excellent. This cuts down on the tiny incidents in class. This works for the students that don't normally create problems, but for whatever reason they are being troublesome that day. Walk around the room and look at their work. If someone is talking tap on their desk. If someone isn't working tap on their desk. You let it be known that it is **your** classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I found your syllabus from a [linked comment[(https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/3enta0/looking_for_a_rules_powerpoint_someone_posted_a/).  Thanks for sharing.  Hilarious and awesome.  I teach middle school and I know that we just pass 'em through.  I'd like to give them as much of the high school experience as I can, and I want to borrow some of your ideas.  No mercy.  "
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, as an incoming high school senior, I would prefer the teacher that would retaliate in kind. The coddling mindset when it comes to children is infuriating to me. It's counterproductive to respect and also to fostering a drive for succeeding. My view on this is the result of two teacher parents and my own current experience with like minded ""children."""
highschoolteachers,"I agree with your sentiment here.

I went through a special education program at UW-Madison and we had the most student teaching compared to other programs (at least the ones I knew people in). I had a full year as a part time practicum in a middle school, then a full year from August through June of student teaching, first semester in elementary and second semester in a high school. I think actually being the classroom and with students while you're learning about pedagogy and such is the best way to go because I think so many of the skills needed to be an effective teacher are difficult to effectively teach someone in a lecture setting. 

I had to take a bunch of general knowledge/content tests, but I found them pretty easy without studying (and some people in my program actually talked about their difficulty with it) but once you passed those there wasn't much in way of talking about teaching specific content). I didn't feel like they really assessed my ability to teach, but were more so just so they have something they can say they tested my ability somehow.

I did have one class on teaching math, but we never did anything with geometry or algebra and seeing the others in my cohort working with the math, I was wondering how much trouble they would have teaching this content when they weren't exactly experts in it (but I do realize having content knowledge is only part of what makes a good teacher, but I think it definitely helps as long as you're aware of your expert blindness)

If teachers want to be treated like other professionals, I think its important to think about what other professionals have to go through and the caliber of person it takes to pursue them. I feel like there's more doctors that would have made good teachers than there are teachers that would have made good doctors. "
highschoolteachers,"No problem! Also, PS--Sorry you're getting down votes. As a high school GSA sponsor, one of my biggest wishes for the school district is that they make LGBT inclusivity the responsibility of ALL teachers, not just the high school ones. There's a lot of important groundwork that can be laid at the elementary level, so kudos to you for recognizing the need!"
highschoolteachers,"I think the relationship stuff is huge. When I was teaching summer school, I found something that helped kids open up was figuring out what they liked, and then asking them why they liked it. How they answered told me a lot about their values and their personalities. I also tried to be up-front and specific about my expectations, and that helped a lot. My mom, a former teacher, told me that kids live up or down to your expectations as needed. Thank you for your suggestions about staying above the social foray of high school, I will certainly keep that in mind going forward."
highschoolteachers,"One of the organizational issues I had my first couple of years of teaching high school was figuring out what to do with handouts for students that missed class due to absences.  I often teach three different subjects every day and have many different handouts.  When students come back to class after an absence, they would ask me for copies of the handouts that they missed.  Finding the correct handouts (even if I was organized enough to remember where I put them) would take valuable class time and was an annoying distraction. 

Once I started using file organizers for my handouts, the problem disappeared.  I now have several labelled [file organizers](https://879ac722fc7af40a9302-5a0fef95d12e11774ef27c066e288635.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/product/29970.JPG) in an easily accessible place in my classroom.  One per course I teach.  The organizers are clearly labelled with the course period, and five file holders in it are labelled with the days of the week.  I also have file holders labelled with the unit names of each unit in that course.  

I train my students at the start of the year to use these folders whenever they are missing a handout (for whatever reason).  At the end of the period, any extra handouts go into the correct folder for that course and day of the week.  If a student was away Monday and Tuesday that week, when they return to class they go to the organizer and pick up one of each handout in the Monday and Tuesday folders.  When the next Monday rolls around, I transfer any handouts left in that folder to the folder with the corresponding unit name - that's where all the extras go.  If a student needs to access handouts from earlier in the year (not just the last week) they can find them there.  

This method (and training the kids on using it) has saved me so much time and aggravation.  I am no longer getting distracted at the start of my lesson fishing around for handouts when kids lose them or are absent.  "
highschoolteachers,"I work at a fairly tough inner-city high school with deeply entrenched gangs. Violence is no stranger, and although fights are much less common than they were on campus in previous years, they still occur.  When that happens the combatants will be sent home with their parents for the rest of the day and instructed to return the next day with parents for a conference.  The reason to send then home on the day of the fight is to allow for a ""cool off"" period, so that a productive conversation can happen later.  

Of course, some acts are non-negotiable; these are criminal acts such as bringing a weapon to school, drug offenses, larceny, etc.  For acts of this level we have two police officers stationed on  our campus.  When serious offenses are discovered, the offending student is usually arrested.  Sometimes when they have completed whatever the justice system has is store for them we see them again. Very rarely they are expelled. Sometimes they end up at another school, often at the direction of the court.  

At any rate, the students were not suspended.  What we found is that the vast majority of suspensions were for violations of the ""no defiance"" rule. Why, we reasoned, should ill-behaved children be rewarded with a day off for bad behavior?  Once suspension for defiance was taken off the table (and this was largely due to our principal), our suspensions stopped.  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English. Just completed 31 years at the same school.  I never think about how many fails is ""okay.""  Each and every student is ""allowed to fail,"" although most of them don't.  How do I ""handle"" students who refuse to work on assignments? I talk to them and I keep talking to them...never hectoring or scolding, and certainly never shaming them...but always there.  I think sometimes they begin to engage just so I'll let them be, and when it feels like that, I'll slip off for a bit, but probably more often they need someone to take a personal struggle they're having seriously, and when that's unwrapped, we talk.

"
highschoolteachers,"Relationship is huge with struggling kids. 

My first year of teaching was at a Title I school (we were about 90 percent free and reduced lunch). If the kids don't feel like you care about them, they're not going to work for you. 

This doesn't mean getting involved in their personal lives. Stay as far away from their personal lives as possible. Since it's high school, they're not going to let you in too close to begin with, but as their teacher, you can't get caught up in their tales of woe. 

Instead, show yourself. Show your personality. Talk about your life and the experiences you've had that allow you to relate to them. Where I taught was a highly populated gang area (bloods and crips, the whole deal). Kids like that value respect and honesty. Above anything else, talk to them like adults, respect their space, and respect their values. If you level with them and say what you need - need is a very powerful word when it comes to getting something out of someone - they'll work for you. 

Good luck! Feel free to pm if you want to talk more. :)"

highschoolteachers,"Believe it or not, insubordination (termed ""defiance"" in our code) is no longer a discipline-meriting offense in Los Angeles public schools.  My high school in Northeast LA hasn't suspended anyone for two years as a result of a purposeful shift toward a less punitive, more humane way of educating.  Not all of our faculty agree that this has been a choice for the better, but I am glad for the change.  "
highschoolteachers,"Whilst you're right that there is a vast disparity between the maths that is useful in a university maths course and the maths that is useful in other areas of life, I disagree that the school system (or hell, any school system in any of the five different countries I've had to look up the details of the education system (I work in a university with a lot of international students, tutoring first year students, so I need to know what I can assume as a starting point) is the latter. Frankly, there is a tiny, tiny fraction of the curriculum that's actually useful in the university maths setting. The vast majority of it (and in this, I include all of the US's calculus modules) will have to be retaught properly at some point, after we've fixed all of the other gaps up. 
So, rather than listening to the general rhetoric from people who don't work in universities about ""what universities want"", here's an answer from someone that actually has to teach the kids that high schools produce: 
We want people that can think. We couldn't care less if the students coming in have never heard of an integral (hell, that might even be an advantage, since we wont have to correct their misunderstandings). We want students that we can throw into unfamiliar problems and have them work through it intelligently. We don't want people that can mindlessly apply some ""correct method"" that they've memorised. We want people who can look at problems, think their way around them, think outside the box, try different approaches to it. It would help if they understood the concepts of proof, but it's far more important that they understand the method by which mathematics is actually done and how those proofs are actually produced (by lots of trial and error,  lots of guess work, and lots of trying weird ideas, then paring them down to what everybody else does after the fact). Given a choice between a student who had ""learned"" (by which I here mean ""memorised"") the material on every high school maths module available and somebody who can give interesting insights into areas that they've never seen before, I'll take the latter, every single time (and, as an aside: they do exist, they aren't massively rare (I'd say upwards of 25% of the general population are perfectly capable of doing this with minimal assistance in primary/elementary school), and in my experience, exposure to mathematics education in school tends  to hamper it far more than it helps (by the time they go to university intending to do maths, that percentage above has dropped to something pretty close to zero, and we spend a huge amount of time and effort trying to fix it). "
highschoolteachers,"Three decades in an inner-city high school, so take it for what it's worth.  

The smartass sarcstic answer (not recommended, but would likely play in my head): ""Right, you don't *need* to do it this way any more than you *need* to pass this class, and that choice is yours.

My actual response would be something more respectful : ""Okay, let's talk about this.  Help me understand why your way is better."" 

 ...And if it's a self-control or behavior issue I'd probably segue into ""Well, what if everyone did that?""  These conversations would, of course take place one-on-one, not in the presence of the rest of the class.

highschoolteachers,"I won't have my opening day meeting until September 2nd (but my last day was June 25th!). We all go to our home schools, get our keys back, get a little time in our rooms, then we load up on school buses and take a trip to one of the high schools with air conditioning for a district meeting. 

While I'm certainly not ready to be excited about going back (I'm only halfway through summer!) it's fun to see people again and prep for real with up to date class rosters and such. I don't have freshman, so the whole next day I have free to set up my room. Freshman teachers have orientation. This year, those two days back will be followed by a 4 day weekend...followed by a 4 day week and then another 4 day weekend! It's going to be a slow start this year. But, I need to immerse myself in summer a but longer... Have fun!"
highschoolteachers,"I'm just starting my second year of teaching, which is high school, not elementary school, but here are some of my insights on the teaching profession in general:

1. Credential school in no way prepares you for standing in front of a classroom for the first time, totally alone and totally without backup. You'll be able to design a hell of a good lesson plan, but all the classroom management techniques and tips you learn about in school go out the window once you have 60 eyes staring back at you.
2. The arts and crafts side of teaching, especially in elementary school, can be seductive and distract you from real prep. No matter how cute the lesson is or how pretty your bulletin board is, if you don't have the ability to back it up with teaching them skills or knowledge, you will not be successful.
3. You will try to like your admin, but your admin will fail you more often than not. If you have a good principal, stay there and rejoice, for they are few and far between.
4. You will be incredibly tired. You will hate your job. 
5. You will be incredibly excited. You will love your job.
6. You will not be prepared for how much you bond with your kids, and how seeing one of them succeed will make you feel.
7. You will not understand how that perfectly crafted lesson, that followed all the rules and did all the right things, totally failed you.
8. You will not understand how the lesson you pulled from thin air in the car on the way to work won the day.
9. You will not learn about how the pressure for the kids to perform well on their tests translates to pressure and anxiety for you. You will be constantly questioning yourself: Did I teach them enough? Did I teach them the right things? Did I teach them at *all*?
10. You will not be prepared for the negativity and antipathy your colleagues exude. You will not be prepared for how many disservices your colleagues are doing to your students. You will be dismayed by school culture. 

Those were the biggest things I've noticed, both throughout student teaching and my first year. I'm sure there is more, but those were the biggest for me."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for this. If salaries were equal, I think I would choose the high school. I student taught seniors and was a long term sub for eighth grade for the same amount of time. I loved both. However, never having had my own classroom before, I can't say that for certain.

$3,000 is enough to catch my attention, but at the same time, it may not be enough to supplement the fact that I'm not doing what I'm passionate about."
highschoolteachers,"I thought that high school was what I wanted to do as well, but the truth is that the middle school students can often be more engaged, more willing, and more fun to be around.  I have had zero MAJOR issues (but many minor) with the middle school students. 

I would take School B."
highschoolteachers,"If you want to teach high school, go with the high school. I was blessed and got to teach both during my student teaching, which solidified the ""oh my god, I'm never teaching middle school again"" side of me, but go where you want to go. 

Once you settle in after a year and you don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off to get all your stuff done and lessons planned, you will be able to take on other leadership positions (class adviser, prom coordinator [good luck], etc) to supplement that salary, and if you end up getting an MA, that will bump you, too.

I'm just one opinion, but having spent a lot of time teaching where I didn't really want to be, I can say that being there in that unwanted place will come through in your teaching. (And who knows - maybe that place for you is the middle school. Flip a coin. You'll know what you want to do when the coin hits the apex.)"
highschoolteachers,"I'm only one semester into my teaching program, but I've been a substitute teacher for a year. The biggest discrepancy I've noticed between school and actually running the classroom is just how HARD it is! There's a world of difference between observing and teaching occasional lessons for my classes and actually subbing and running the ship all on my own. It's fantastic and fun and rewarding and I can't imagine doing anything else...but I feel that people who haven't had classroom experience like subbing wouldn't understand this part of it unless they tried it. I think it's because the load is greatly lessened because the actual classroom teacher is always there with me. When you're by yourself, it's up to you to deal with EVERYTHING...not only teaching, but dealing with small problems, being bombarded by chatty kids when you really need to be prepping for something else, being a counselor and a confidant for a student who started crying in the middle of a lesson for no reason, dealing with a sick child, etc. etc. etc. It never ends, lol, and I feel that when you're just doing observations and student teaching for school, you miss out on how overwhelming it can get when you're on your own. Is there a way you could start subbing? It might shed some light on this. Plus, you can see what grades and age groups you like. I started this adventure set on teaching high school...now I'd be really happy at the elementary level. Good luck!

*edited to add context*"
highschoolteachers,"I started my teaching career at 32, so you're certainly not ""too late"" to start.

How it works depends on what you want to do. If you want to teach at the high school level, you'll want at least a bachelors in the content area you want to teach (or at least a related field - i.e. a journalism degree would get you a position as an english teacher.) Not required, but desired and it will make you much more competitive. You also need to go through some kind of credential program which involves student teaching in order to be certified, as well as pass content area tests.

To teach middle grades, you'll still need a bachelors, but it's less stringent on what it's in - typically you can get away with a minor in your content area. Schools around where I am from often expect middle school teachers to be certified in more than one content area, though not always. (Usually either math/science or ela/social studies).

I think with a BA in biblical studies, you likely have the skill set to become a good English teacher. Critical reading/analysis of texts are right up your alley. You'd need to become familiar (if you aren't already) with more explicit content area knowledge in order to pass the certification tests, but the skill set is there. Or, if you want to go the private school route you could just teach *actual* bible classes.

Yes - there are different requirements for different states. Check your state's Department of Education website for further details on the specific process for your state."
highschoolteachers,"I think you could easily pull that off with the younger grades, but once the kids hit middle or high school, no way.  It undermines the teacher's authority and intelligence.  Why should a teacher be advised to omit personal connection?  I don't want to be a robot, I want to be a teacher and mentor."
highschoolteachers,"Current paraprofessional  (aka para educator) here. You'll most likely be asked a lot of questions that reveal your personality and ways you would resolve issues. 

Firstly, you need to realize that your educational background puts you ahead of the curve of many para educators. Some of my coworkers only have their high school degree. Don't let your degree make you too comfortable because many of my coworkers also are in the process of getting their M.Ed. Just make it clear you have an educational background that's tailored for this position. 

What you want to demonstrate during your interview is that your primary job is to work **with** the teacher to make the class as dynamic as possible. You are neither the type of person that is basically another warm body in the back of the room nor someone that is going to challenge the authority of the teacher.  Your main objective is to assist the teacher so that you can make the class the best learning environment possible. No school wants to hire someone that is going to rock the boat and make the teacher's job more difficult. You want to be a team player. That being said, if you see students rights being violated (which I have in high school in the form of the accommodations in the IEP being ignored/the teacher outright refused) you need to bring it up with the teacher privately before or after school. If the teacher refuses to change, you need to go up the chain of command. If you sit idly by, you may face repercussions for turning a blind eye. 

You want to demonstrate that you are someone that has compassion, but is also able to be objective about situations when required. You know how to handle behavioral issues appropriately in a way that is consistent with class expectations, but you are also able to think of alternative ways to handle behavioral issues for students with  developmental disorders. You should probably drop key words like positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, token economy, forward and backward chaining, etc. and know the meanings of those terms. Don't drop any lingo you're not positive about because that may be awkward if you're called out on it. You never want to use punishment to diffuse problem behavior.

You will probably also be asked how you feel about assisting students with their bathroom needs. This may include changing diapers. I work in high school and occasionally have been asked to help with toileting situations/to change diapers. If you are uncomfortable with this/flat out refuse to do that, then you need to be honest. You may not get the job if you refuse to help with toileting, but you will also cause a ton of issues and potentially may be let go if you refuse to deal with toileting issues but claim during the interview to be fine with it.

Also, just remember to let your love for children shine through. Too many people lose their love for education and children. You want the interviewer(s) to realize you have a real passion for enhancing the lives of students and seeing them grow educationally. 

I don't know if this needs to be said but at some point mention you're a team player and flexible in your job requirements.

Good luck! "
highschoolteachers,"I taught 7th grade ELA one year after teaching mainly 11th grade Composition for multiple years. The biggest difference I noticed was that the middle schoolers had trouble not only handling what should be personal problems but also discerning when they were just that. 

For example, a high school student announcing to the class that s/he doesn't have a writing utensil is relatively rare. The rest of the kids would look at him/her like, ""What's your problem?"" In middle school, no one sees it as weird/abnormal to do that. A high school student who does not feel well and wants to go call home in the office would just say, ""May I have a pass to the office? I think I'm feeling sick,"" while a middle schooler would detail for you how s/he had diarrhea after waking up and his/her stomach is churning right now and blah blah blah. If you're trying to hold a discussion around a piece of literature or topic, the high schoolers really only get unfocused on purpose to distract you if they are bored, whereas middle schoolers will politely raise their hands and share the most asinine thing (a family story or some other unrelated connection) but actually thought it would be helpful to the class to hear about it and are genuinely upset to see the exasperated expression on the teacher's face. 

I think by the end of the year, my most spoken phrase was, ""Sounds like a personal problem...""

The parents, especially when it's their first/oldest child, do nothing to help the situation because they also can't discern between personal/private life and issues versus school/public concerns. I was inundated with emails detailing really insanely personal things (medical information irrelevant to the student's learning, sordid details from home, scandalous info about divorces, etc.) from the middle school parents, whereas only the freakish high school parents provide you with any of that info (in my experience, at least). "
highschoolteachers,"What do you mean hoops? Do you mean that coming out of the graduate program, with diploma in hand, student teaching complete, and certification done, that I still won't be able to teach right away?

The plan is to finish the entirety of the Master's program (with built-in certification), within two years, and then get two years experience in a public or private high school anywhere in Chicago so that I can then go to the Middle East (Kuwait), as two years' experience is required for the program I am interested in. Time is limited in my situation. "
highschoolteachers,"High school science here. Even in high school teaching chemistry can be impossible if I can't separate the kids that won't eat paste. That 19 year old 10th grade that still thinks snorting everything is funny? Have an admin that thinks everything is your fault? Well I guess everything more dangerous than glow sticks and ice is out. 

Now give me inquisitive children that will listen when I say ""this will put you in the hospital, DON'T (and not take it as a macho challenge ) and we can do some amazing stuff, no matter their current achievement level."
highschoolteachers,"I taught high school inclusion classes with a co-teacher for 5 years. In my experience, there are generally three ""tiers"" of students receiving special needs services.

Tier 1 - Students with IEPs who are in general classes. This would be the biggest group. Most students with disabilities can be successful in a general class, with the support of a co-teacher. They generally have learning disabilities like dyslexia or ADD/ADHD, autism, or mild cognitive disabilities (low IQ). They receive accommodations relating to their disability, like extra time on tests (and the different room can help cut the anxiety of testing students because of the smaller group), modified tests, or being allowed to type an essay for a standardized test instead of hand write it. My co-teacher would take students who receive accommodations into another room when they had a test or quiz, and she would read the test aloud to them as well as give them extra time. Not all students used their accommodations. Some did not generally need them, they were just legally there just in case. You could opt out of accommodations for any reason.

Tier 2 - Students with IEPs who are in self contained academic classes for all or part of the day. These students have more of a severe disability that would keep them from being successful in a regular class. They might have a more severe cognitive disability or learning disability. But they can still learn academic content. The self contained English classes at my school were for students from grades 9-12 and mostly focused on paragraphing, spelling, basic reading comprehension, and basic grammar. Many of the kids in self-contained classes were on a general high school diploma track, but some were on track for a certificate of completion.

Tier 3 - Students in the life skills program. These would be students with profound disabilities who don't take academic classes. Most students in a life skills class are unable to read or read at a very simple level. It depends on the kid's ability level, but the goal of a life skills program is to help the student live as independently as possible after he/she is finished with school (life skills kids attend graduation ceremonies, but they don't get a diploma; they are legally allowed to attend school until age 22). Some life skills students have jobs that they go to during the school day; at our school they worked at the CVS across the street, or they may have jobs that they do around the school, like cleaning the cafeteria. 

Unless you're a licensed special ed teacher, you would not be working with students in tiers 2 and 3. The students with disabilities in an inclusion class are not going to appear outwardly ""disabled"". But they are going to need extra help and support from you, for the most part. I had a few students with IEPs who excelled in my class, but more often than not, my inclusion students struggled significantly with English and math.

Special education all depends on the student's ability level, which is why it's called an Individualized Education Plan. I'm a huge believer in inclusion, and that most people with disabilities can succeed in the classroom. Sadly, inclusion doesn't always work out the way it's intended to - there are many horror stories of co-teachers not getting along or collaborating, or classes that are over 50% special ed (I've had them - it's supposed to be that no more than 1/3 of the class has an IEP). However, I've been fortunate to have had mostly good experiences. My students with IEPs are often the most diligent workers in the classroom as they've had to adapt to struggling for most of their academic career."
highschoolteachers,"In my experience, MS teachers have more classes to prep for and often will be cored (math and science are usually together).  In high school, I think you need a test to teach the higher level maths.  In high school, you have a lot more demands for testing, including the ever powerful CAHSEE (exit exam).  

I ended up loving MS, even though I started in high school.  I may go back to HS one day just to have fewer preps.  I love MS because I can be goofy and we can have a lot of fun.  In MS, the staff is smaller and the school is smaller, just because you have only 2-3 grades.  It's easier to work together with others in PLCs.  If you want to work in a smaller school and really get to know your students, then MS is the path for you.  

In HS, because there are more teachers, there is more stuff!  There are clubs and dances and events that MS sometimes struggle to put on.  There are school rallies and career events and electives.  If you want to champion a club, a class, or an activity/ sport, then high school is the way to go.  "
highschoolteachers,"How is this ""cream of the crop"" group chosen? Do all kids have an equal chance to be part of it? Can a kid who had a rough start get into the group later? If all kids have a truly equal chance, I could see it being similar to the ""Student of the Week"" thing a lot of elementary classrooms have. You could even choose a kid one week who does struggle but made a significant gain in some way, even if he's not at the ""advanced"" level.

If the group is relatively homogeneous and static, I absolutely understand your gut feeling. You don't want a ""good kids vs. bad kids"" mentality in your class. And you don't want the kid who tries but who has ADD or can't do work at home to feel like he can never be successful.

Why not find a private way to recognize the kids who consistently do their best? I teach high school, but writing a note or message to them always helps them understand that I appreciate them. "
highschoolteachers,"Nailed it. 

I'll even reiterate: Please **actively** teach note-taking, studying, and organization skills. I taught 8th grade general science for 3 years while simultaneously teaching high school biology and had to remind myself every fall that those the skills have to be overtly taught via repeated modeling over and over again. The only ways to know you've done it right is when they're automatically doing it or (even better) carrying those skills over to use in their other classrooms. 

I love the intellectual challenge of teaching upper level courses, but you're right that there's nothing better than the highs of teaching middle schoolers. They're not ashamed to hug. I only had to be enthusiastic, with wide eyes and a grin on my face when I told them we're gonna have a good day today and they would be whole-heartedly in to whatever the lesson was. They're (mostly) still respectful of authority.

Man, now I miss those little squirts..."
highschoolteachers,"We have two forms of teacher/classroom arrangements in my board for gr 7-8.  

1. Rotary teachers - specialised in a particular subject area and only teach that to several sections of the same grade.  Much like traditional high school set ups.  So you'd teach many students the same subject all day.  (I taught 420 students music last year)

2. Homeroom teacher - you teach all subjects to the same 25-30 kids.  More like a traditional elementary set up.  You might have one or two specialist teachers come in (ie. French, phys Ed) but otherwise you do it all. 

&gt; To me this doesn't directly imply a student requiring ""support"" to complete the work. Most that do something like this would be doing it because they forgot to complete the work or didn't want to. 

I consider students struggling with responsibility and organisational skills that interfere with learning as needing ""support"".  *Why are they forgetting their work?*  Over scheduled?  Don't know how to keep an agenda?  Maybe having to care for younger siblings at home? *Why don't they want to complete the work even though they are capable?*  Would they rather demonstrate learning in a different way?  Is the work too easy and boring?   

It is important to me to understand why these things are happening.  Even if it is unrelated to the concept we are learning.  Learning skills go a long way in life and further education.  

I guess your hands are tied with your reporting system.  Seems odd to me that behaviour can't be reported on when it is a major variable in the learning process.  Can you comment on these things on the report cards?  Our report cards are provincially standardised.  So all of Ontario schools evaluate student learning skills and behaviours on report cards from k-8."
highschoolteachers,"Seconded on the helicopter parents. I think grades mattered more when I taught high school because parents were thinking about college. 

However, in middle school I find there are some parents that expect specialized updates and catered, individualized attention to their special snowflake. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach in a 5th-6th grade school (intermediate school). Our district has 4 grades k-4 elementary schools, 2 grades 5-6 intermediate schools, 1 grades 7-8 middle school and 1 grades 9-12 high school. As some have said already, the upper elementaries age are often not very good role models for the younger students. Also, I teach 6th graders and some of them are bigger than me. I had two students this year who were almost 6 feet tall and 200+ pounds. This could be avoided by keeping the grades separated, but some of those big 6th graders could really hurt a kindergartener or first grader if they are doing something they shouldn't be doing, like running in the hallway, etc. The district I attended for school was originally set up like the one I currently teach in, but they have since switched to k-5 in elementaries, 6-8 in middles, and 9-12 in high schools, which I also think is an acceptable division because there is a noticeable difference between 5th and 6th grade in size and, to some extent, maturity. The 6th graders definitely act a lot like middle schoolers, although at the same time I think they do the best in a school with just 5th and 6th grade...keeps them a little more sheltered for an extra year. "
highschoolteachers,"I've taught 8th grade as well as high school.

Going from High School to Middle School, expect the following:

* More nagging/helicopter parents
* Students will need much more redirection and cues to stay on task. Working in groups is much more successful, though, provided group work is more than ""Finish this worksheet together""
* You can reward them with candy. And it's great. High schoolers don't care about tangible rewards like this because they can just go buy it for themselves.
* Students are generally easier to engage and encourage. There seems to be a certain point in the sophomore year that most kids assume that they will never change and accept the way they are. Middle schoolers are all still full of hope and optimism.
* Planning and grading time is generally the same, though plan on doing more activities and projects. They aren't ready for the daily grind of high school classes, so be sure to break the pace with fun, content-related activities.
* Bullying is much more visible. I'm not saying bullying disappears in high school (in fact, it likely becomes worse), but middle school students haven't learned how to hide their bullying from teachers yet. The ""we were just playing around"" excuse will get said a lot.
* Less standardized testing (in Ohio, anyways), but more focus on that one test.
* If the students like you, they will draw pictures for you. Hang those suckers up!
* Conference night will be much busier.
* IEP/504 implementation is going to be much more scrutinized, too. I was constantly making adjusted tests for students in middle school. High school students will often try to avoid using their accommodations at all (except for extended time, they' abuse that to no end).
* They don't really know what note taking is. Do high school teachers a favor and teach this as a valuable skill.

I definitely prefer teaching high school as it's emotionally much more stable, but the highs in teaching middle school are unparalleled.
"
highschoolteachers,"I went through my undergrad and grad school thinking id teach high school. I took middle school classes for the extra certification because I had the space. I did my internship in the high school and loved it. They're able to think of more complex ideas and have a base understanding of life. But I got a job in middle school and I LOVE them. they're funny and want to be loved and confused about life. They're complex because everything is changing for them but they genuinely want you to like them still, which is important because I want them to learn from me. 

One of the best things was that I can catch them early before it's ""too late"" and they've given up in high school English classes. I can teach them with songs and stupid stuff because they laugh at poop jokes. 

Middle school kind of sucks because their grades don't really count until high school. I work in a high poverty area so education isn't really valued. But the kids are worth the effort and energy and they're just so much fun to work with. They can be really bad because they haven't developed an understanding of consequences and long term, but that's part of what we get to teach them. 

"
highschoolteachers,"All Middle School Children should be locked away until they turn into High School Children. They are the devil. Seriously. 

I teach in an urban district, taught high school for 5 years (AP Calculus), due to budget cuts was forced transferred and taught 7th and 8th grade math for 1 year. I was about to quit. Thank god I got back into a high school. Middle School teaching is not for the feint of heart that's for sure. "
highschoolteachers,"Middle schoolers are all about the drama. Friendships are unstable and they cannot just let it go for a class period and focus on school work.

Skills are more important than content. In high school, you use skills to teach content. Middle school you use content to teach skills.  "
highschoolteachers,"I've taught science &amp; math in high school for 7 years, and I think the real issue isn't that students aren't capable of making judgments/being logical, it's more that they don't really care enough to *try*. They've spent ~10 years in a system that's based purely on knowing a single specific correct answer and anything that doesn't fit within their expectations simply isn't worth their time. 

I used to think the problem was more concentrated with lower achieving students, but this past year showed me that honors students are just as guilty of the issue. So many students have a need to answer first that they don't spend any time actually engaging in the thought process.

It doesn't help that the high stakes standardized tests they take in June encourage their mindset. The Regents Physics exam in NY for example, is primarily a test of vocabulary and basic algebra skills. If you know what variable represents a given quantity, can choose the appropriate formula, and correctly solve for the missing term, you'll score very well on the exam (students are also given a list of all relevant terms and every necessary equation on a reference sheet while taking the exam). I've had students who would ace this exam fail to correctly answer very simple conceptual reasoning questions on the same content. Instead of asking ""How far does Billy travel if he's moving with a velocity of 10 m/s for 2 hours?"" you simply ask students to interpret/create graphs of Billy's motion, you get wildly different results. In the same vein, simply removing the options from a multiple choice question to make it a short answer question has a similar effect. 

If I have any concrete suggestions, I would try to make it the norm from Day 1 that you are more concerned with understanding than you are with trivia. Don't make reasoning skills a thing you touch on once and then forget about in favor of a style more aligned with standardized tests. Focus solely on students being able to make and justify claims, giving multiple opportunities to improve and hopefully everything else will fall into place. "
highschoolteachers,"My first year was 10-12, second was 8-9, third was 6 and 8, and last year was mostly 10th (this upcoming year will be all 10th). My degree/certification was for grades 7-12 and when it came time for student teaching, I couldn't decide and ended up splitting my semester between a middle school and a high school, hoping that would help make it clear which I preferred. I still don't have a preference. :) They each have pros and cons, and I've enjoyed all ages (except 6th. I hated that). You do have to focus more on step by step teaching and organization in middle school than high school, but high schoolers can sometimes think they know more than they do, which gets annoying. Don't worry too much about it: middle schoolers can actually be really fun, despite what most of the public thinks."
highschoolteachers,"I currently teach grades 7-12 at a private school.

The high school kids understand things a little better, so it is easier to push them with in-depth projects. For the most part, their higher order thinking skills are developed further than middle school, so you can challenge them more easily!

For middle school, it's just fun to teach them general life skills. Sometimes they seem blown away when you reveal some interesting info to them. I also like to encourage them to share their own ideas and teach them that it's okay to have your own opinions!

It's fun, I like both age groups. High school seems to have a little more drama than middle school, but I find that (as a young teacher) high school kids are willing to listen to advice I give them about life. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach special education, so my main focus is getting kids to the point where they can function in a regular classroom. With the huge push for inclusion, I really worry about the challenges for both students and regular education teachers when we put students into classes that they are not prepared for.  

I really feel like we are doing children a disservice by passing them if they are not able to demonstrate proficiency in basic academic skills.  If my son was in high school and was not able to at least read and write well enough to be a functional adult, I would prefer for him to spend 4 years learning those skills even if it hurt his feelings that he couldn't be with kids his own age.  Maybe having to retake Freshman English would motivate him to work hard enough to pass the second time around. I know there has been a big push to increase high school graduation rates, but if we are just lowering the standards it is meaningless. "
highschoolteachers,"I am also one year away from getting a bachelor's in History and English. What one of my teacher-educators told me was to ""always"" get your history license through a program because if you take the test to get your license then you are never going to get hired. In short, make sure you go through a program (in Indiana they are online and take about a year). Also, what I'm doing is I'm going to shoot for teaching middle school to start out and then slowly build up to high school. "
highschoolteachers,Yes. I teach middle school and high school. But I might ask to join the walking for fitness classes. 
highschoolteachers,"Depends on age level and support of your administration. For elementary it can be missing recess to do classwork - if the missing academic stuff is significant than discussion with parents can allow pulling the student out of electives to deal with core academics. At the high school level athletic eligibility can be at risk - basically hold the student back from practice to do their missing content.  Now one can complain about ""kids need recess, they need electives, they need their sports"" but at some point an adult has to triage the situation and decide what is important. If the family doesn't want the student pulled out of anything then our hands are tied as teachers we have limited ability to re-do content when we are in the middle of teaching the continuing content.  It somehow has to happen outside of class time or we just snowball the problem."
highschoolteachers,Attempting too at least (the job hunt is hard) but yes I'm certified for 7-12.  In my student teaching I tended more towards lecture with my high school students and used it less for my middle schoolers but it was still an effective method as long as I kept the pace fast and the students asking questions with plenty of sarcasm about the subject.
highschoolteachers,We did tai chi in my high school French class. It was such a great way to start the 90 minute block or break it up.
highschoolteachers,"I agree. By high school, not having technology at home places kids at a huge disadvantage when it comes to their peers. They have significant difficulty getting essays/research assignments/projects done on time when they only have class time to work on it. Sure, there's the public library, but having transportation as well as being able to actually use the technology there can make it even more difficult. Our education system is increasingly paperless and reliant on technology, such that a laptop or other device is almost necessary for today's student to have."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science, so I run the following ""Tragedy of the Commons"" activity to introduce the topic before teaching them about sustainability and the effects of overfishing in Canada:

* I break up the class into small groups of 4 or 5 (depending on class size).  Each group stands around a desk where I place a bowl.  I tell them that the bowl represents a communal lake shared by the group.  In each bowl I place a small number of M&amp;M candies to represent the fish. The number of candies I start with is usually 6 per student.  So a group of 5 starts with 30 M&amp;Ms.

* The kids are instructed to turn around so their backs are to the bowl. Each student in a group gets assigned a number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). When I call that number, the students assigned that number will turn around and will ""fish"" as many fish as they want out the bowl.  None of the members of the group need to know how many M&amp;Ms the others take (and often eat).  We do this for one round giving each kid a turn.  The students then turn around to check how many fish are left in their bowl as I walk around and add more ""fish"" to their bowls.

* The key is that the number of M&amp;Ms I add to each bowl depends on the number of ""fish"" each lake has left.  I simply double the numbers left.

*  We go for four rounds like this. Once a group has emptied their lake of candy I will leave their bowl empty for the rest of the activity and they just get to quietly watch the other groups get more candy.  At the end, the groups with fish left in their lakes get to keep the remaining candy in their bowl.

I explain the activity to the class before we begin. What I don't tell them, however, is that they get to share the remaining candy at the end of the exercise or how many rounds (fishing seasons) we will go. They know before we start the activity that the best way to keep candy in their bowls is to keep as much candy as possible in the bowl at the end of each round.  They often assume that they will only get to keep the candy they fish out of the lake each time they get a turn and, without knowing when the activity will end, the trick is to get as much candy as they can without depleting their resource.

Almost every year there is at least one group in the class that empties their bowl on the first round. Usually most groups will empty their lake before the end of the activity.  Once I had a group that, by agreement, ate no candies throughout the activity and ended up splitting almost 200 M&amp;Ms between four of them. 

The kids enjoy this activity and I can get some good discussions from them about sustainability and the ""Tragedy of the Commons"".  "
highschoolteachers,I have a friend and a professor who have presented on using this in the high school and college classrooms. 
highschoolteachers,"Seriously though. To graduate from my high school you have to pass Algebra 1, but you can't just keep taking it over and over again once you pass it. I took Algebra 1 *in 7th grade* and am being forced to take math classes at a level that I don't care about at all since I plan on being a History or Language teacher"
highschoolteachers,"I think there is a huge disparity between math you need to go to college/university and math you need for adult life. I actually think this is where the school system failed me (personally). 

I, very weirdly, was better at beginner trigonometry than I was at a lot of the other math skills required to pass grade twelve math. In fact, I'm pretty sure trig is the only reason I passed grade 12 math. Grade 12 math seemed to focus on getting us ready for the three OAC courses (grade 13); Algebra, Calculus, and Finite. We still had grade 13 at that point, and those courses were prerequisites for a variety of university/college programs. 

I didn't take any of them. By the end of grade 12 I knew I wasn't going to be able to do university level math. I took Psychology (and English) and had to take statistics twice to pass it with a C. I did great in Research Methods though!

Anyway, all that to say, since grade 12 I've never had to do any trigonometry, but I bet some people with different career paths have. 

I think I've stress-blocked the rest of it out of my mind because it was so traumatizing/embarrassing to have someone repeatedly help you with something and still not get it.

If there had been a course about cooking conversions, measuring and scale, percentages, budgeting, smart shopping, banking, financial planning etc. I would have benefitted greatly. 

Instead, I learned the beginning of trigonometry.

I'm sure I learned the skills needed to do a variety of things mentioned above, but I likely didn't connect the purpose behind what I was learning because I was so stressed about memorizing the formula I needed to get the right answer.

So now when I need to do math that's over my head, I go on YouTube and watch a video that teaches exactly what I need to know. 

As a follow up question, would you expect a 45 year old math teacher who hasn't taken English since high school to be able to discuss Twelfth Night spontaneously because they read it in grade nine?

"
highschoolteachers,"Nope, has to happen in high school. "
highschoolteachers,"Ok, so he's required to take three high school math credits. The Algebra 1 doesn't count as a high school math credit? Around here if you take it in middle school you still get high school credit. "
highschoolteachers,"Wait.... Algebra 1 is a requirement in 8th grade? I ***just*** read my fourth or fifth article describing the brain research on why this is a horrible idea. 

Also - Algebra 3 is college algebra? They require a college level course to complete high school? Tell me how that makes sense?
"
highschoolteachers,"I think if it's required in high school, then people with a high school degree should know how to do it. Call me crazy, but to me that's kind of the whole point. 

I don't expect everyone to be able to TEACH it, but it shouldn't be so completely beyond you that you throw up your hands and tell your student you can't do ""that math stuff,"" we have a problem. Either we shouldn't be requiring it, or our teaching has been totally ineffectual for several decades. "
highschoolteachers,"That's great that you are certified to teach so many subjects! I continue to believe that there are teachers out there who despite their best efforts (endless tutoring, help from their teachers etc.) scraped by in a subject of weakness. I don't think it makes them any less capable of teaching their subject of mastery and I think if it was expected that every teacher be able to teach all high school subjects that you would lose a lot of great teachers in favour of people who are great at memorizing things. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt;I'd be interested to hear your opinion on this after you've spent some time as a teacher.

Even then, I doubt it. I'm talking about things like dress code, student parking, etc. Minor things that were huge issues at my high school. Administrators want power, they want control. If an administrator says it, it must be true. You must do as they say. Just more slaves to the system.

&gt;This is frightening for at least two reasons.

Why?"
highschoolteachers,"Oh, yes, I agree! My advice is coming from a high school teacher's perspective... specifically juniors and seniors. :)"
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Well, when you're in college and you have an exam, the professor doesn't care if you're deathly sick. 

Absolutely not true. Using the ""college professors are strict"" excuse to justify strict policies is a cop out. Elementary school teachers say the same about middle school teachers, middle school teachers say the same thing about high school teachers. There are college professors out there that wouldn't budget even if your entire family died in a plane crash and there are professors out there that are complete pushovers. And everything in between.

Really, any blanket statement about an entire class of people is a load of bull anyway. Don't use other people as an excuse to justify procedures.

EDIT: Furthermore, linking a student's grade to their attendance (by making the makeup test harder, for example) dilutes the meaning of a grade. Grades should demonstrate only what a student knows, not whether or not they skip school. It also penalizes students that were legitimately absent, which is entirely unfair to those students."
highschoolteachers,"I completely agree! I would add to the belief that not only is college not for everyone but for a huge number of kids college should not be entered into immediately following high school. 

I teach at a private school in a large city that loves to tout 100% college acceptance rate. The college counsellors insist students apply to a minimum of 8 schools. These kids are told that not only will you go to college you will go to a top tier college. At graduation they announce where the student is going to college as they walk across stage to receive your diploma! It was a huge deal last year when a student said they were going to take a gap year before attending college. 

I have so many students who have been pushed so hard for so long they don't realize there are other options out there. I realize I teach at an independent school and it's a different demographic than public education.  But I think it's even harder for these kids to say they don't want to go to college now or ever. They don't even know it's an option for them to not go to college yet still be successful in life. When I talk to my students about this they look at me like I'm crazy; I'm the first adult that has ever said them, ""college is a choice and it's not for everyone. You can still be intelligent and not go to the best school, wait a few years to go, or not go at all."" 

This has turned into a ramble but I'm just so tired of being surrounded by colleagues, administrators, and parents that only see one path to (or definition of) success that they deny the existence and merit of other options to the point where the kids don't even know there is any other way to be a happy and productive adult. If they aren't ready for college or college isn't right for them they are made to feel like failures at life and that is what I have a huge problem with as an educator."
highschoolteachers,"Ewa Beach ftw! When did you graduate?  Granted, it's been about five years since I've been there, but in the years that I was there Campbell had started a downward slide. And if we're talking a/c, you KNOW Ewa can get hotter than hell, so I'm sure some of those classrooms at Campbell can be saunas.

I'd be interested to know if the ""newer"" high school out in Kapolei was built with air conditioning."
highschoolteachers,"I was a four-sport athlete in high school. As a teacher I have attended hundred of sporting events to support my students and their interests. I believe athletics have a huge role to play in character education, student engagement, and community pride...

With that said, 90% of football coaches I've ever encountered are complete and total assholes while being terrible teachers to boot.
"
highschoolteachers,"I actually dropped out of high school, and ended up getting my diploma via online correspondence. At school, I'd show up stoned, not hand anything in, write notes all period, and scrape by with a 50 even though I was capable of a 95. Doing it virtually meant that I had no choice but to do the work because that was the only way the course would end. There was no tuning out because I was the only one there. Even if kids are allowed to retake a test until they pass, that's basically just a form of studying.

I do think the critical thinking part is key, but I don't think that the only way to teach it is necessarily in a classroom. "
highschoolteachers,"My school is 98% Hispanic, on it's third principal in five years, we are ranked academically unacceptable, had a 52% turnover in teachers this year, have about a 10% four year retention rate, have a rampant but ignored drug and gang problem, and our school hasn't had an update in over fifteen years. There are parts that haven't been touched since the seventies when the asbestos was put in and the fluorescent lights went up. 

Another hs four blocks away is 59% white (and is actually called White high school, ironically). Both built around the same time, similar layout bit strangely, they have had the same admins for over ten years, consistently have high scores, have a low turnover (like somebody has to die), have zero drug and discipline issues and recently got a huge new library and band hall. 

Don't tell me plessy v ferguson was overturned"
highschoolteachers,"Don't forget a mini sewing kit, pads, tums, and tea bags. I taught middle school last year and teachers even sent high schoolers to me. "
highschoolteachers,Except I'm lazy as fuck and high school me picks the easy questions and the medium questions.  I blaze through the easy one with no work whatsoever and show one line of work on some of the medium level ones.
highschoolteachers,"Future teacher here.

1. Your (administration) rules aren't as important or as great as you think they are.
2. Community college is not the best thing ever and can take a lot away from students
3. The SAT and ACT are not everything.
4. Earning a degree is hard, finding your own way is hard, but I find it hard to believe you never slept and missed meals to afford to earn a degree.
5. Students bringing in their own technology (laptops for notes and projects, phones for looking for information) is long over due.
6. As someone else said, teachers should have the option of having guns, especially in the Tidal I and urban schools.
7. When a teacher in high school is 6-8 years older than the students, don't be shocked when inappropriate things come out."
highschoolteachers,"Based on the fact that this person is History/Government, I think it is safe to say they are working with older high school students."
highschoolteachers,"Depends on what work. I'm not even aware of what is done in primary school regarding work. I double majored in math and chem and teach them in high school. 

If a kid has reached the point where they can rearrange an equation in a single step instead of multiple, that's fine as long as they write down what they did. But no kid is going to get away with having no work on their homework assignments. I'm not sure if you view ""showing work"" in the same way I do, since you seem to view it as an arbitrary set of rules about what you have to write down, while I view it as a guide that says ""if you did it, show me how you did it so I can tell you understand the process."" Otherwise, you write down a wrong answer somewhere and neither of us know why you got it wrong. "
highschoolteachers,"I absolutely can and do help students with assignments in all core areas. I'm certified to teach both English and Math at the high school level. 

Edit: If we say this is the basic minimum level of math you need to be a functional adult with a high school diploma, shouldn't all teachers be able to do it?"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, for 10 years... My goals are to work on student relationships, parent contact and bringing home less work (so that I can spend more time with my own kids). I am more of an introvert so I have to work harder to build relationships and to always act friendly. I also have trouble not transferring my frustration with a few students to the entire class. The last one is getting better every year."
highschoolteachers,"Absolutely. I cannot agree with this enough. I want more vocational training programs. There are so many reasons why every single person cannot go to college, from intelligence to laziness to money. It is ludicrous to expect 100% college acceptance/attendance from a high school, but apparently that's what is being pushed."
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching a while, 12 years in high school and 4 years in junior high. I always recommend good ol' Harry Wong and the First Days of School to anyone who's new. Procedures are so very important, especially in junior high. Figure out how you're going to manage the bathroom and the drinking fountain and going to the nurse. Trust me, they'll want to go every day if you let them. 

Lesson planning will really cut down on the classroom management issues. The more engaging your lessons, the less discipline issues you'll have. Make sure your expectations are reasonable for what they can developmentally do. Junior highers can't sit for 40 minutes and read silently without doing something. It drove the HS teacher in me nuts but when I realized that junior highers process information socially, through talking with each other, did I really make a break through in my teaching. Get a timer and use it. I tell my students they have 2 minutes to discuss with a partner and set the timer. They focus right away because time is ticking by. 

I could ramble on at length so I'll wrap this up. Those problem kids will always be there for you, every year. The best teachers at my site absolutely love middle schoolers. We're crazy but so what?"
highschoolteachers,"Can subreddits have their own version of the badges? Then we could give stickers or a smiley face drawn in those scented markers.

BTW, I teach high school and my kids still love both of these things."
highschoolteachers,"I'm at a great school, although since it's my first year here (high school SpEd) I am a bit of an observer of the bitching and complaining that happens. That being said, I usually only hear the venting in appropriate settings, such as FAC events when being professional is not necessarily a requirement. Since I am SpEd, I tend to be the outsider because I am required to collaborate with just about every other content area. I'm sure they get annoyed with me at times, I know I get annoyed with them. I try my hardest to leave my baggage at the door and present a professional facade, because that is what I expect of all other teachers. I think that in school environments, norms get set, and they are not always the good ones. I think that if you want to stay, maybe reach out to admin to express your feelings if how these norms should change and see if they can help facilitate a discussion about this. IDK. I left my previously school because I felt that the admin inadvertently supported negative work habits that were very passive aggressive. You can do it, keep searching. "
highschoolteachers,"Do kids ever complain to guidance counselors or teachers about abuse from parents as a way to get revenge against mom and dad? I know I'm mandated to report but sometimes I do second guess the motive...I'm in a high school, students are mostly 16 or 17...the age when they are sophisticated enough to use this .... many want to be granted emancipation and this would be the ticket..."
highschoolteachers,"My dad is definitely a jerk for that and did a lot worse the day he found out I self-harmed, but that’s a different story. The solutions I mentioned aren’t permanent fixes, but help me coast through until I was an adult (and then the waiting time between trying to convince myself to go to therapy). I hit a breaking point in college where one day I was just over it - I was going to kill my self. I put a call into my counseling center and that has been what’s gotten me to where I am. But in high school, online resources kept me a float. (It also didn’t help that tumblr, weheartit, and tv shows romantize self-harm, this drove me to do it even more before).
I suggest going to therapy; you don’t have to dig into the big things right away. You can always start with a smaller (but still relatively pressing) issue to talk about, and work up from there. I was scared for a long long long time to go, but it turned out to be great and I really enjoy it. I hope it can do the same for you."
highschoolteachers,"I saw something interesting about this yesterday. A teacher somewhere asked her (high school) students to go to the board and put a tally mark every time they got an alert, notification or text during that class. By halfway through class, the board was *filled* with small marks.

We have to fight this. The phone is just too interesting to compete with Shakespeare or quadratics or molecular systems. Take it away? Maybe. I think it depends. But, they’ve got to go."
highschoolteachers,"I worked at your school. I know what you mean. But I want you to know there are better situations out there.

I managed to move from an inner city high school to a suburban/rural one and the atmosphere couldn’t be more different. Absenteeism is low and people put a lot of effort into their jobs. As well, nobody is obsessed with the job, either. People leave when the day is over and go live their lives.

Some people whine a little here and there, but it’s mainly your typical “Oh man, I can’t wait for the weekend.” kind of thing.

There are good places to teach."
highschoolteachers,"what kind of bullshit is that? there are plenty of male history teachers in my district and afaik there's never been an issue. all of my high school social science teachers were men, too, and i attended another district in the area that is wildly conservative in all the worst ways."
highschoolteachers,I’m in the same boat. I self harmed all of Middle and high school. I teach science now. I have two students who constantly do it. I got out of my way to be extra kind and patient with them in everything because I know what their life around them must feel like. It really sucks though. 
highschoolteachers,"1. I spent 4 years getting my bachelors in secondary math education, and I ended up minoring in math as well. I'm certified in 9-12 math.

2. I have ~$30k in debt.

3. I teach 9 - 12 math in public school.

4. I believe I'm around $42k before taxes/insurance/etc (I take home around ~$30k at the end of the day)

5. I don't have a spouse. I live at home with my parents currently (went back to school to get a masters, and my old roommate moved too far away for me to move with her). I might be able to squeak by if I didn't live at home.

6. I'd be able to support myself, no family to take care of.

7. I think teachers fighting for what they deserve is awesome, and a show that we can't be walked all over.

8. I haven't seen a teacher quit to leave teaching, but I'm planning on it, and I know at least one other friend who is seriously considering leaving as well.

9. Absolutely. Granted, I work in a title 1 high school so there's a lack of respect for any adults/authority at all, but yes. Teachers are seen as glorified babysitters to a lot of people, and weirdly enough, people still believe ""those who can't do, teach."" I'm pretty smart, and I took enough hours of pure math to get a minor- I still have students who think, because I'm a teacher, I'm not bright. Very odd"
highschoolteachers,"&gt; My question to all of you is, is teaching worth it to you? Other questions: - middle school or high school? - public or private? - is one state better than another?

you should try all these situations and figure out what you like."
highschoolteachers,"6th grade is when I started and I know for a fact at least 3 teachers in my time from then to high school graduation knew and did nothing. 

I didn’t kick the habit until my senior year of college, and it probably would have stopped earlier if one of those 3 teachers helped "
highschoolteachers,"After reading this, I guess I am in a great school (or my expectations have gotten so low that I THINK I'm in a great school). Half of my department loves teaching and comes in excited about it every day. We have one good administrator who actively participates, listens to faculty, and tries to make the school a better place.

So, yes, we are out here.

Also, I teach in a US Title 1 high school."
highschoolteachers,"I attended a charter school very briefly in high school. I always thought it was hilarious that my teachers were so strict about letting kids use the bathroom, yet my Algebra II teacher would let me leave out the side door in the middle of class to get ice cream from the shop next door as long as I brought her back a root beer float. I dont know what that was supposed to teach me besides quid pro quo."
highschoolteachers,"I had to deal with this a week or two ago, except she was doing it IN CLASS.  Had a mental breakdown in the middle of the hallway trying to prevent me from turning her in (I already had, the stupid admin told me to bring her to the counselor's office).

&amp;#x200B;

Weighed on me heavily, and still does. I know I did the right thing, but don't know too. Glad I stumbled on this thread for reassurance that I did do the right thing.  It's rough, and part of the job no one ever thinks of outside of the industry.  My sister had a similar problem in high school, but I don't think she did at school.  The at school thing really threw me for a loop, probably meant she had a blade on her.  Also, the student told me something on the way to the counselor that fucked me up for a few days too. "
highschoolteachers,"Happened to me in high school.

I went to a private school.  A kid stole my journal out of my locker, photocopied it, and sold the photocopies to kids around the school.  We could've had him arrested for theft.  The school assured us he would be punished.  Instead, I got a day of suspension for the content of my journal (I bought a book to school that wasn't academic in nature, so I got a day of in-school suspension).  I was then grounded for a month because of the suspension.  The kids' grandparents bribed the administration to let them off the hook.  Despite a confession from the kids who did this to me, the school did not suspend them and told my parents there was no evidence to convict them, thus we should not press charges.  

Guess who is now sitting in jail?  Not me.

Guess who learned to never put your kid in a system so open to bribery?  ME.

&amp;#x200B;"
highschoolteachers,"Right? The only thing that shocks me about this is that people are shocked. Then again, I went to an elite high school. I saw people get into Ivy's who were definitely not quite Ivy material, but, well, Daddy was legacy, or make a considerable ""donation,"" and what do you know? Suddenly that not-quite-Ivy student is an Ivy student."
highschoolteachers,"I think it's important to dress professionally in a high school setting. For me personally I've only been out of college for two years so I'm not that much older than the students so I think dressing professionally helps set us apart from the students, especially if we look younger and could be mistaken for a student if we don't. I'm also a new teacher so I believe it also shows that I am professional and take my job seriously.

With that being said, I love a good casual Friday. My current school does Jean Days on Fridays almost every week (although it's always sponsored by a club at the school and we have to spend $5 for the privilege of wearing jeans so the club can fundraise for themselves)."
highschoolteachers,"I’m teaching in NYC currently as a first year high school teacher. I don’t recommend it. I babysit more than I teach. If you do plan to, look for a nice area and a decent school community. Visit the school pretending you’re a parent interested in sending your kid there. If you see the kids running the school and not the staff, run away. I’ll be real with you because everyone else is going to sugarcoat things for you for the sake of being politically correct. If the school is a Hispanic or black majority, you’re going to lose your mind if you’re not teaching an AP class. "
highschoolteachers,"Mm, yeah, no. Our school has the equivalent to a scorched Earth policy about cellphones - no cellphone to be seen at any time during class, instant detention if it is - and it has had a very positive impact on focus in the classroom. We've tried the integrated cellphone use, and it just gets abused way too much to be worth it. As it stands, making cellphones universally banned in classrooms is clear, obvious, and (if you have half a brain cell) easy to follow.

I really resent the idea that teachers just need to accept this constant disrespectful distraction as a part of life: firstly, cellphones were a well established thing when I was in high school not that long ago, so it's not me being ""out of touch"" that makes me not want to see phones in class. Secondly, conversation is far more ubiquitous than cellphones even, but we don't go around arguing that teachers should just accept being talked over all the time as part of normal classroom culture. ""Have you ever tried reframing this distraction as a positive so that you can accept it?"" is beyond insulting to people whose profession it is to understand the best environments for learning. "
highschoolteachers,Yes. No one studies your high school transcript during the hiring process. High school only matters for college. 
highschoolteachers,"I certainly don’t mean to put more value on a phone than education, and if it works for your class, simply not allowing their use is most likely the most effective way to fix the problem. And yes, I knew those methods existed already, I was just speaking more so on a high school level."
highschoolteachers,"I haven't been in high school for over ten years, but as far as I remember the bad was really glossed over. The war was framed as a justified fight on both sides with slavery being a footnote. We did not go into detail about the horrors of slavery and instead got a very vague state's rights excuse (that didn't mention that they wanted the right...to own slaves). Then again, your mileage may vary. This was a while ago, and my high school was not great/had clueless coaches who did not care teaching history."
highschoolteachers,"I've posted this one before, but:

A parent told me that it was unreasonable of me to expect that her son understand that the multiplication of two numbers could be represented by an area.

Their son was a Junior in High School taking physics.

She was a high school math teacher."
highschoolteachers,"Not private, Victorian public/government school. Philosophy is a subject you can take in VCE (high school certificate). I was so excited when I found out it was a subject I could teach at highschool because I picked it up in my undergrad and loved it."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. My administrator regularly tells me to write them up for phones and out of dress code violations but he does nothing and sends them right back to class and they are pissed at me, which makes them not want to do shit i say. So i said screw it, I’m not caring about phones, it’s a sink or swim environment in my classroom and sadly a lot of them will sink due to school and district culture."
highschoolteachers,"I would, but they'd say yes, then I'd get in trouble if I didn't report them (not that anything would be done if I did).

My students generally openly discuss their drug/alcohol use until I politely remind them that I have to report such conversations, yet I have not yet developed alzheimers regarding my high school years. Please leave me my ""plausible deniability."""
highschoolteachers,Why not reward the kid to take a year two off if she/he/xe/xer graduates high school early? You do not have to trade a kid year for an adult year. Reward the kid for the intelligence. Allow the kid to explore the world for one or two years. 
highschoolteachers,I agree. I teach high school so in general most of my colleagues don’t need to be in the floor or getting dirty so they shouldn’t need to dress down most days. 
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school algebra I which is mainly freshmen. Not only that, I have 5 periods of co-teach that are heavily SPED students. The other class that is co-teach is so refreshing, students generally get the material quickly and I have the classroom atmosphere to where we try to help each other so even the ones that don't get it will get help from others."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, I promise you every 18 year old well understands what it takes to get into college."
highschoolteachers,"No, they will not be checking your high school record.."
highschoolteachers,No one gives a fuck about your high school suspension record u less it involves an actual crime.
highschoolteachers,"My co teachers are difficult.   I go between 3 grade levels, 1 is an emotional roller coaster that jumps from listening to me to snapping at me and in general hates having sped in her class and how the sped dept is ran (shes not wrong, its fucked up how much of this dept is a number game at the expense of students and staff);  the other is very passive aggressive and controlling and hasn't one time this year asked me anything personal about myself at all, because she doesnt care and because she thinks I'm beneath her I think.  When I walk into her class, Its like walking into a group of mean high school girls between her and her 2 paras; and the lasr one is mostly normal but sees me as strictly support.

Hell today they told me I couldn't be in the inclusion  class picture (despite being with this class 80% of my day). But they let the student teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I wouldn't reach out about an actual job 2 years in advance, but you should definitely start building connections with the high school by volunteering and whatnot.  It makes that conversation easier to start when the time is right."
highschoolteachers,"Here’s what I would tell any parent looking to accelerate their child a year in school.  I did it for my own daughter, and bitterly regretted it.  She skipped second grade and went straight into third grade. 

When a kid skips a grade, it’s going to go exactly how you think it’s going to go - at first.  There may be a few adjustments in the beginning, but within about a month, the child will be doing great. In fact, he or she will probably be close to the top of the next grade level, too. But here is what you’ve done...

You traded away one of your child’s “kid” years for an adult year. That’s one whole year earlier that they are going to move out of the house and be away from you. Having a 17 year old go off to college feels super fast. A 16 year old?  Even faster. 

And what about that 16 year old in college.  If it’s your daughter, do you think she’s emotionally ready to have a 22 year old man hit on her around campus?  Better yet, when she’s 13, how about an 18 year old senior who pays her a lot of attention?  Have you seen the movie “Thirteen”?  Now do that to a kid who’s a year younger. 

If it’s your son, who will he have the confidence to ask out on a date when he’s 13 in high school or 16 in college?  It can be really, really tough. The social adjustments necessary to go from second to third grade are really nothing compared to what they’re going to be heading into high school and then college. 

My daughter was 100% ready to go skip second grade when I made that choice for her. When she started eighth grade, it was obvious - she was intellectually ready for the challenge, but not emotionally ready for it. Luckily, we moved school districts after she had been in 8th grade for a month. I found a sympathetic admin who allowed me to hold her back and make her repeat 7th grade. Man was she upset with me. The only way we got away with it is that she had moved away from her previous friends and school. She aced the 7th grade of course. Twice.  But I absolutely do not regret getting back one of those “kid” years. Now that she’s in college, she doesn’t regret it either. 

She got to be a totally normal kid in high school. Dating, hanging out with friends, driving in her junior year... just like everyone else. If any parent is considering jumping their kid up a grade, I would tell them about my experience and encourage them to reconsider. There is plenty of time to become an adult. Skipping second or third grade isn’t going to help a kid one bit in the future, but it might just hurt a lot. 



"
highschoolteachers,"I grew up in Texas. I have never heard it called the “War of Northern Aggression” seriously. But, my high school AP History teacher did do the whole “the War was never about slavery, it was about states’ rights” bit that I’ve since learned is total bullshit. "
highschoolteachers,"I went to high school in rural Georgia. I had two history teachers refer to it in all seriousness as the war of northern aggression. They also taught it with a ""us vs them"" mentality. I should also mention that they were in their mid 50s or older.

My younger sister is attending high school in PA and has had a completely different experience. They spent a full month learning about slaves starting back when they were first bought up until now with a week spent on the outcomes of slavery and women being sold into sex slavery. 

I teach in NJ and I know we also follow a very similar curriculum. "
highschoolteachers,Oh no I cant do high school lol
highschoolteachers,"While I do think it's important to dress professionally, I think part of it is also dependent on what you teach. I saw a lot more teachers dress comfortably (not always casually, but maybe more dresses and leggings than dress pants for example) in elementary school where they have to get down a bit lower than in high school. But yeah as a general rule I think you're right and we do need to dress professionally, especially if we want people to take us seriously. If we dress like babysitters more people will start thinking we are"
highschoolteachers,Can you give us an idea of your grade range you'll be looking for? Some resources are definitely better geared to elementary/high school etc! 
highschoolteachers,"My experience in the Florida Public School Systems: I graduated with a BA in English, didnt know what I wanted to do, waited tables for a year. Randomly got an itch to teach, so I applied online for my temporary certificate. I literally had it in less than an hour (seriously just like that) and started applying for jobs. I went to the rough schools first and was super honest with them about my lack of experience. I got two job offers immediately and had a classroom in less than a couple weeks. It went really fast. I took all my professional classes while teaching middle school ELA. My district paid for all my professional schooling, but it was a really poor district so they really want teachers. I stayed for two years and then moved to a better district and up to high school. 

I'm five years in, and I look back and cant believe how whirlwind everything was in the start. Dont be afraid to say hey! I've never done this but I want to! And take their training, advice, and feedback seriously. But, (and young me is shaking a social justice warrior fist at me right now) I advise against teaching in those crazy poor schools if you can help it. You learn to be a good teacher but at the sacrifice of your mental and physical well being. 

TL DR: I dont think you need to wait. Get out there! You know English Lit. You got this! "
highschoolteachers,"In high school, I had a math teacher that was Muslim. He only taught statistics and a class about college prep, so not a religion teacher or anything. But he had a big poster of the Kaaba at the front of his classroom. Didn't think about it much until I was sat right in front of it and had nothing else to look at. I did wonder what others thought of it and how protected he was to have it up. It didn't bother me at all, but I was very curious. I'm looking for answers about it too. "
highschoolteachers,This was a school policy at the last (charter) school that I worked at. It is one of the many things I will not miss about being a classroom teacher. Why I am supposed to tell people not to use the bathroom? Shouldn't we be teaching high school students to be responsible for themselves?
highschoolteachers,"I just wanted to say that I think it’s SO cool that your school offers philosophy. I loved philosophy in college and had no idea I would. If I had taken a course in high school I might have minored in it in college. Are you at a private school? I can’t imagine many public schools would offer philosophy, but I wish they would."
highschoolteachers,"I have come to the same realizations as you but it had the opposite effect. I love teaching because I get off at 3 every day and save all my creative energy for myself and my hobbies. Plus helping the kids that do want to learn and be engaged is energizing and fulfilling, and I teach high school so I am at least occasionally mentally stimulated and challenged while at work.  "
highschoolteachers,"I'm slightly concerned that a teacher is cleaning up blood (My school we would call a custodian who has cleaning solutions, gloves and stuff to deal with body fluids) 

When I was teaching high school I usually just told my classes if you have a short term health issue (ie I'm not feeling well today, period issues) I don't need details, if you've already gone to the bathroom this class period just tell me you aren't feeling well, or you're having hormone issues and need to go. I'll let you go.

If anybody asks to the bathroom and I have questions about them needing to go I usually ask them to wait 5 minutes - the kids who NEED to go will tell me they can't wait and I let them go to the bathroom."
highschoolteachers,"Body positivity helps. I’ve had girls who will signal to me that they are on their cycle because I am body positive. Building trust early on helps a lot. As far as bathroom breaks - sometimes you just need to trust the kids to make decisions. If I’m in the middle of teaching or an important part of the lesson, I ask if it’s an emergency. By now, kids don’t ask me during those times unless it is. I have been predictable and consistent, so they know. 

Now the kid who smells like weed, refuses to do work, and follows me around holding ‘things’ even though we are in high school... nope. Sorry. Not allowing you to go get high and bring that back into my classroom.  "
highschoolteachers,"My German teacher at my high school and I think my Chemistry teacher were both in the first yearbook the school ever made. Maybe my Sociology/Psych/U.S. History teacher, too. The school opened in the late '60s and I graduated in 2010."
highschoolteachers,My son’s high school English teacher told us she didn’t have time to meet his IEP accommodations. I asked her what they were. She had no idea. They were extra time on assignments and being allowed to go to the SPED room for testing. He also had some accommodations related to managing diabetes. What a shit show. He moved to a private school and she doesn’t work there anymore.
highschoolteachers,"My high school where I attended ran 7:30-2:25, which was an awesome schedule. I was tired a lot, but I loved being out at 2:25.

The school where I am a building sub runs 8:00-3:00, which is later than most schools in the area. I am required to be here at 7:10, however. "
highschoolteachers,"Philosophy in high school?  That would be awesome. 

"
highschoolteachers,Wow that's early. My high school was 8:20-3:20. The elementary school started earlier for staggered busing. 
highschoolteachers,"My high school ran from 7-2, but I liked that schedule. I wish I could teach those hours too. Different strokes different folks. 

Why work there 10 years if it’s that bad for your health? Is the school awesome in other ways? "
highschoolteachers,"I went to a small rural high school, most of the teachers taught students parents. One lady was on the third or even fourth generation for some of her students; she taught there for 50 years."
highschoolteachers,"I don't prepare my students for the world, they need whatever I'm teaching (math, ESL, geography) to get to the next step, most immediately it's graduation, often it's college. If we were preparing them for the world high school would be more like Dickensian and the kids who needed IEP's would be mobbing the lunch lady for more gruel. That being said the IEP's I've seen were more of a hall pass than aid to learning. A guaranteed grade on a homework or exam robs the student of constructive feedback. On the other hand you can be a math genius and not be able to sit in a quiet room, weight of the world on your shoulders, and execute flawlessly. Given the time I would happily change my tests to ""hay, here's your home work back, try this extra batch of questions, and get back to me."" Now that I think about it I'm glad I don't do life prep, worrying about them understanding verbs gives me enough sleepless nights."
highschoolteachers,"I have subbed, taught high school, taught college, and worked in a department of education. I have been on all sides of this subject. Subs have the worst pay per disrespect of any other worker in the field. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach SPED high school math, so I've only ever seen the students that aren't good with math, or REALLY don't want to be there.  I use phones (and district-provided macbooks) for things like Kahoot or Quizizz, but I really don't see them needing them outside of that.

A district about an hour north of us banned all cell phones, and it seems to be doing alright.  So I wanted to see what everyone else thought, too."
highschoolteachers,"Oh yeah, I took an elective class about war and peace as a senior in high school and we had a couple of war vets come speak to the class. Of course the first questions kids asked were about their kills. And I'm sure most adults think the same thing when we meet a veteran (I mean, I know I do), we're just polite and have enough impulse control not to say it, because we understand that war is traumatic and it can be hard to talk about those things. Of course a third-grader from a country that isn't an active war zone is going to think war is like Star Wars, because they haven't been exposed to the reality of it. "
highschoolteachers,"You might be on the wrong level (high school, etc.).
 
What concrete feedback have you received and what did you do with it? What feedback was the same?"
highschoolteachers,"Its a trap, and the students know it.

When a politician is asked something, they answer the question they wanted to be asked.  Pick something that feels comfortable, but here are a few:

""You know, there were people at my high school who smoked a mess of pot and they always said it didn't effect their brains, but they don't seem to have much ambition.""

or
""After four years at State U, and getting a Master's degree, I don't want to be found dead in a ditch with a brain full of chemicals.""

or
""When people buy illegal drugs, where do they get them?  From criminals, right?  How do they even know what's in there? ""

From there, go off in some direction away from the question.   "
highschoolteachers,"My wife and I are both high school teachers- I'm in my 4th year (5th overall), and she's a first year teacher. We also have three kids under the age of 5. Life is stressful, to put it mildly. Over the last couple of months, we've instituted what we call ""A Smoke and a Poke""- we go home before picking our kids up from daycare, have a smoke- just enough to take the edge off - and then partake in marital relations. It may sound ridiculous to a lot of people, but it gives us a time to vent about work, relax, budget (only once a week), and make our marriage the priority, even if it's just for an hour or so. So there's that, but I also refuse to take work home with me; my wife, our children, and my mental health have to be my priorities when I'm at work, so I leave my work at the end of every day. "
highschoolteachers,"Both my husband and I are in our sixth year teaching. He teaches high school and I teach upper elementary. We have to have our space and we vent to each other with limits. I appreciate that he understands what I’m going through, which my non teacher friends have no clue how to relate to. We also have ‘teacher free zones’ where he try our best not to talk about school or work related things. We try to recognize teaching is a career and not a ‘calling’ and we both deserve to be full people. 

I hope things turn out well for you and I’m sorry this relationship didn’t work out. "
highschoolteachers,"I guess it depends on what each districts’ lawyer thinks and unless there ends up being lawsuits that won’t change. In my district in high school the case carrier writes a gen ed mainstream form and it describes the accommodations, goals, strengths and weaknesses. If a GEN Ed teacher wanted to read the IEP they’re more than welcome but it is not expected."
highschoolteachers,"I had swine flu when I was in high school and then pneumonia. They have a system where you petition for extra time explaining the necessity (doctors notes are enough). Look into it, try not to get others sick."
highschoolteachers,"So your teacher should have to put in more hours to increase your grade?  Maybe you should have not skipped assignments.  If you were working that hard and not seeing results, you should have gone into office hours for help.  Lowering the bar in not the solution, learning how to effectively use your resources is a solution.

Mastery of a course is not dictated by hours worked, it’s by meeting objectives.  From the grammatical errors and poorly formed arguments in your post here—I can see why you might not be doing well in this class.  You should be completing all work and using office hours to help improve your scores.  Should have started going in for help as soon as you were failing writing assignments—that’s on you.  But we learn from failure too...so try to learn from this.

And the McDonalds management program pays and promotes workers really well!  Don’t knock it!  I had a student working full time in high school to support his entire family at McDonalds.  When he graduated from high school, he was accepted into their management program.  He is paid well and they are paying for his college classes...of which he is acing his courses while working full time. "
highschoolteachers,"At least in my high school experience, you do not want to miss any days of school. You come back when you start recovering from your symptoms to find out you have an absolute mountain of work to do that makes you miserable from lack of sleep and prolongs the sickness. Most kids at my school would’ve rather just power thru because of school system didn’t offer any reprieve for having to take time off. We didn’t choose to get sick so why do we gotta suffer for it?"
highschoolteachers,We've got the same at my high school.  
highschoolteachers,"I love being a high school teacher.

There is no way I could be an elementary or junior high teacher.

No fuckin' way."
highschoolteachers,English 2 and 3? This sounds more like high school....
highschoolteachers,"One year at my (very high achieving, upper class) high school where I work, we had a major flu outbreak because kids were afraid to miss review days for midterms, and then afraid to miss the actual midterms! Um, kids, I promise you can still get into Harvard or Princeton if you are late taking your science midterm by a few days your sophomore year of high school. 

The Friday of that week, the district released us early and cancelled all weekend activities- no sports practices, nothing. Why? The administrators and custodial staff basically spent the afternoon and evening, and most of the weekend, wiping down almost every surface in the building with bleach."
highschoolteachers,"I used to teach middle school math and now teach elementary.  I can't believe he's being marked down for this.  I would've marked him as ""above grade level"" after individually conferencing with him to make sure that he conceptually understood that multiplication is repeated addition (and how to write it both ways). 

Her feedback is also just plain wrong on the first page.  4+4+4+4+4 is a correct way of interpreting the array with the instructions provided -- marking him down for not doing 5+5+5+5 is bullshit.  In my district, feedback like this would take you from being a highly effective teacher to a minimally effective teacher.  Seeing that score of zero for that question makes me angry. 

However, I wouldn't confront the teacher over it until you figure out more info (ex. Is she using a district-mandated rubric that provides no leeway/she has no choice in the feedback?  Would a confrontation actually do anything or just leave everyone with bad feelings? etc).  Confronting the teacher over stuff like this is worth more of a fight in middle or high school when cruddy feedback like this can impact a student's GPA.  "
highschoolteachers,"As a high school student, I wish I could stay home if I was sick. I been getting my meds changed all year and a lot of them made me really sick, and it ate up all my sick days. If I call in sick now??? Guess I perish. "
highschoolteachers,"I’m feeling the same way. I’ve been teaching this set of kids for two years, which is not typical at my school. It probably won’t happen again. I adore these kids-they’ve made me really mad at times but I know I’ll cry on the last day when they move off to high school."
highschoolteachers,"I tell them ""Turn 18, graduate from high school, find me somewhere off campus, and I'll answer that.""

Someone always says ""THAT'S A 'YES!'""

What do I care what they assume? I didn't answer the question, and I didn't lie."
highschoolteachers,"I left the high school classroom, because I already could see how bad the elementary and middle school students were. It is not worth getting paid so little to be overworked and disrespected so much. The apathy of students get worse each generation, and the entitlement increases with each generation. "
highschoolteachers,"I tell them that every person I know who smoked a bunch of weed in high school has grow up into a sad loser with a crappy job.

I smoked my share of weed, after college."
highschoolteachers,"I stopped playing online PvP because of the sheer volume of salt.  But as a gaming teacher, I agree with you on all points.  

My parents used to say ""if it makes you angry, it isn't a game, and you aren't playing"".  Boy, does that hit home now.

I also have students who want to quit high school because they're positive they'll make a great career as a YouTuber or a streamer.  I try to tell those students that literally no one wins tournaments after 30.  And in real sports, no one really wins anything after 40.  Find a real career."
highschoolteachers,What are the high school kids like?
highschoolteachers,Kids are really tough these days. I’m a high school teacher second guessing my career choice. 
highschoolteachers,"My go-to: ""It wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss my personal life like that in a classroom, just like I wouldn't make any of you admit to anything you have done while you're here in my classroom. But I can talk about what I know and my thoughts and feelings on drugs."" It's possible they'll think it's an admission, but lying to them isn't any better. In high school, drugs will be a part of their lives regardless of if they do it themselves. It's no use lying or not being serious with them about the topic. "
highschoolteachers,"Go to clinics. I'm going to the Little Kids Rock thing in Colorado.

Go somewhere. I'm driving to Arkansas and Florida to visit Family.

Do your hobbies. Perfect time to go fishing, workout, etc. 

Drumline makes it sound like you are a music teacher. Teach private lessons. If you are middle/high school see if your district will run a 1-2 week summer camp that your kids can sign up for. 

Be a summer school teacher/sub. My district is still asking for summer music teachers and people to sub for regular teachers when they call out. 

Get a summer job. Get hired as temp somewhere or as a tutor. Parents need caretakers for their kids since they don't have school now too. "
highschoolteachers,"If I were the kid's mom, I would have him post an apology/clarification on Facebook. Even though your girlfriend wouldn't technically see it, his friends would. It should include key phrases such as, ""By allowing my friends to act rudely and crass toward someone I admire and appreciate, and joined in myself, I embarrassed myself and my family. It's inappropriate and unbecoming of a gentleman to speak about anyone like that, let alone a teacher and mentor.""

But that's my kid.

Your girlfriend did absolutely nothing wrong, and she should not try to hide it. She doesn't need to volunteer it, but if she's asked if she has ever had any issues with students, she can bring it up and disclose how she, the boy's parents, and the boy handled it, which was very well. If she is still in contact with the boy, it's important that she imparts on him that speaking of her like that was a betrayal of friendship and confidence, and that she thought he was a better person than that.

Teen boys are something, man. A lot of times they don't have the confidence in themselves not to fall into the disrespect-of-women trope, and sometimes they don't know any other way.

I remember when I was in high school, I was the only girl on a drumline full of boys. They talked horribly about girls. Once I became an upperclassman and captain of the drumline, I felt more comfortable speaking out. During one rehearsal, the band parks and blows (stands still and plays) while the dance team dances right in front of the drumline. A couple of the guys were making crude jokes about the girls on the dance team, so I said, ""Excuse me!"" to get a couple of the girls' attention. When they turned around, I told my guys to repeat what they had just said. They turned red, and hemmed and hawed while I continued ordering them to repeat what they said. They finally did, and I looked at the girls and asked, ""Would you date a guy who talked to you like that?"" They all said no.
It drove the message home, and I noticed a change in how they spoke about women. Most of them are starting to get married and while I was reminiscing with one who's having his first child soon, he jokingly mentioned that I could be pretty scary in high school, ""Especially when you called us on our bullshit, like with how we talked about girls.""

Sometimes they just don't get it. They posture in front of each other and they don't realize that it's actually insanely unattractive and disrespectful."
highschoolteachers,"I would go 6-12 if you're only doing one. It opens you up to high school, especially if you're certain you don't want to do elementary.

Side question, you don't get a certification through your degree program? I did a Secondary Social Science B.S. and was certified Social Science 6-12 by the time I graduated. I'm in Florida as well. "
highschoolteachers,"Go for as many certifications as you can.  I only originally intended to teach high school math, but got 5-9 certified as well just to open up more possibilities for jobs in the future.  I am also now certified in Physics and plan to add Gifted Education.  The way things are, I want to be as good a candidate for a job as I can be, even though I don't foresee leaving my current job anytime soon."
highschoolteachers,"Hey fellow male teacher.  I taught high school for five years and currently work at a university.  I started teaching at 23.

Here's some *fashion* tips.

If you are teaching in a high school at 21, realize that you are **EXTREMELY** close in age to your students.  What you can do to differentiate yourself is dress.

Here is/was my go-to attire for teaching:

Start from the bottom:

**Shoes**: Get some nice loafer-style or with laces.  I went with black, light brown, tan, and a dark reddish brown that can be worn with black pants or brown pants.  Don't buy dress shoes, buy the ""sneaker"" style of dress shoes, something with padding, with a little bit of give.  You want something with a decent amount of sole, you'll be on your feet a lot and walking around.  Make sure they don't rub the back of your heel, either.

**Socks**: Don't get traditional dress socks.  You'll be on your feet a lot (again) and you want something comfortable.  For black shoes, I purchased some black athletic socks (they look the exact same as black dress socks, cost much less, and provide infinite amount of comfort.  Get some green, tan, grey, red socks that are comfortable.  They make good conversation starters with students when your socks match your tie or shirt.

**Pants** Get you some Khaki's.  Nice pairs.  Colors are important.  I had two pairs of brown in different shades.  1 khaki, 1 navy.  Pick up two nice pairs or slacks (not khakis, occasionally you do need to step it up).  Get one black and one brown.

**Belts** Get at least two belts, one black and one brown.  Wear your brown belt with brown shoes, your black belt with black shoes.  

**Shirts** It's okay to have some polos, but you don't want to wear those until your students know you are serious.  Get some nice long-sleeve collared shirts.  I suggest some basic solid colors.  You should always have a white shirt, that's a given.  Get some plaids and anything that interests you. As you teach, you'll pick up school based t-shirts.  These are perfectly fine to wear on appropriate days (pep rallies, etc.)

**Shirts** (cont'd) - Never wear your collared long-sleeved shirts without something under it.  I suggest picking up some white Hanes undershirts or something along those lines.  

**Ties** You don't need to wear a tie every day you teach, but it definitely helps to set you apart at first.  I suggest a couple of solid color ties, something with stripes, and then have some fun.  Kids like to connect.  Bust out your superhero tie or your adventure time tie every now and then and the students will love it.  Learn to tie a tie quickly and when you aren't wearing it (you'll be helping students tie them for prom, dressing up before games, etc).

**Jewelry**: As a man, jewelry can be a bit odd in the classroom.  If you have piercings and your school district doesn't care, keep wearing them.  Nothing overly audacious, most school districts are anti-gauges for anyone.  Realize, however, that you may alienate some students and you may have some students love you for the style and type of piercings you wear.  *Watches* are great.  I have a nice watch for ""dress-up"" days and then I have a wear any day watch.  Deuce brand makes slim watches that you don't have to worry about banging on doors or something - http://www.deucebrand.com/collections/the-original.  *Rings* are cool, just realize they are conversation pieces and something innocuous to you might spark a long conversation.  (I wore a ring I had purchased at a Native American reservation and I got into a long conversation with a student about his Native roots - pretty cool way to build a relationship).

"
highschoolteachers,"This.  I also teach 8th grade and IMO they are too old to be lining up.  Time for them to learn how to enter a room like a normal person and be ready to go when class starts.  Not that they do it 100% of the time, but they don't need to walked through the process anymore.

We don't have a set policy at our school but most of the 6th grade teachers still line their kids up, only a few 7th grade teachers and no 8th grade teachers.  It makes for a nice transition from elementary to high school expectations."
highschoolteachers,"I've considered becoming the bow-tie guy. I've only worn once in my life at my junior high school prom, and I thought it was pretty awesome. It could possibly become my ""thing"" as well, but I'm also wondering how that appearance would look as far as looking genuine and true to myself, since I *never* truly ""dress up."" I've heard many times kids are experts at picking out when you're not being genuine or are being fake.

Thank you for your input!"
highschoolteachers,"For my high school English class, we rely on Idea Channel on youtube. It's a PBS production that uses heavy philosophy and cultural theory to discuss pop culture (or vice versa). For example, when we were studying Cat's Cradle, we watched his video on Community and Postmodernism.

Really, all the stuff that PBS is producing on youtube now is excellent. "
highschoolteachers,"i really love this idea - I'm a soon to be first year high school math teacher!

My question is, is it ever a pain to bring the boxes to and from school?"
highschoolteachers,"In Alabama, all that is *required* is a high school diploma. What remains to be seen is whether or not the job-seeker market is so saturated that people who lack a four year degree are filtered out. 

I'm definitely going to go the masters route. As you say, coming from a psych degree, there will be a lot of deficiencies to be made up. It may take just as long to address those as it would take to get the masters. The pay difference between a B.S. and a M.Ed. is $10K a year. It's a no-brainer."
highschoolteachers,"I've been coaching dance team at the high school level for nearly four years. I had a similar experience during my second year with a very new program. I had a parent who was a very competitive dance mom from a **big** dance team community. Because our program was so new, not many kids had experience, and her daughter was the strongest dancer on the team. This fact led to a lot of entitlement on the dancer's part. The head coach became too close (friendly) with the mom and consequentially, the daughter got away with a lot of stuff (example: she was still able to keep her captain title after being caught bringing alcohol to a team event). 

She became really insubordinate to assistant coaches (me) and so I had to address the issue after a practice. Well, apparently, having to talk with the dancer about her disrespect caused her to think about killing herself. The mom took us coaches aside and reamed us AFTER A COMPETITION, in front of other dance teams/parents/coaches, and after we had just won two 2nd place trophies. It was awful. I chalked up this blow up to the fact that the other assistant and I were wanting to do the right thing by reporting the alcohol incident to the athletic director, and I'm assuming the head coach told this to the mother. She made the rest of that *year a living hell. 

I finished the year out, but decided I was done with that program and its toxic environment. I found a better program that pays SO much better and has harder working kids, more appreciative parents, and people who admire and respect what I do. I couldn't be happier. Just remember, don't ever feel bad for your decisions. Do you, and try not to let any narcissists ruin your experience."
highschoolteachers,"Last I hear, the kid is failing high school, just in case it's the same kid. 
"
highschoolteachers,"I don't know that age group very well, but I feel that it might work with them, let them know that in high school, they will be expected to follow this structure.... and give it a try. "
highschoolteachers,"I've regretted my decision to teach at the elementary since fall break.  I would love to try high school buy I'd have to go back to school to do so.  If I'm going to go back to school, I don't think I'd go back for education. "
highschoolteachers,"Instead of leaving the profession, have you considered teaching at the high school level?  I get to make jokes and be sarcastic all day, the female to male teacher ratio is very close to 1:1, and getting into coaching may help fulfill that sense of male companionship. "
highschoolteachers,"First year, can't quit after that. First year sucks for everyone. See if year two is any better and then make a choice. Like most jobs, this one gets easier. Unlike most jobs, the demand is intense from day 1. Also, you can be completely real with the kids. I had a kid who does shit work tell me he's going to be a football player. I told him about some three kids at my high school (including one who was drafted first round in the NFL draft out of USC) and his eyes rolled back in his head. I work K-5 for reference."
highschoolteachers,I asked my Facebook friends if they had any books they would be willing to donate to a classroom (it helps if you are friends with older couples who no longer have kids at home/ newer couples who have kids in jr. high/high school.)
highschoolteachers,"I am a school level IT Support employee in my district.  Since I am a former classroom teacher I had been supervising the student Tech Assistant program at the high school I was previously at.  I had this one kind of wildcard student who was a handful but always did everything that I asked of him and the teachers who he helped with computer problems absolutely loved him.

When I changed schools in February this year's group of students gave me a Thank You card on my last day.  On the card this student wrote: ""Thank you for being my role model and keeping me out of trouble.""  I never was sure if I was really getting through to this student but now I know I was getting through to him more than I ever knew."
highschoolteachers,I've always wanted to understand what the whole nonsense was with the rating restrictions with movies.  They kept that same rule enforced until high school.
highschoolteachers,"&gt; but surely spending some time disconnected from this borg collective of texts and memes

Do you not realize sir, resistance is futile.

I'm currently taking a course on developmental/educational pyschology that my program requires.  One of the questions we actually just discussed was whether or not the technology of computers, the internet, and the mass network of interconnected technology has actually changed the way people's brains work.  Do they remember less (because they think they can look anything up)?  Have people's attention spans changed (to the point where they check websites obsessively or phones for notifications)?

In one way cell phones are very similar to passing notes or bringing in a toy to the classroom, but at the same time they are changing the way we respond and expect things to happen.  Instant results and gratification are more expected because of what technology allows us to do.  Personally I am on the fence about whether computers and phones are useful or not in the classroom but the fact of the matter is more and more school districts are getting computers for students to use in the classroom at the high school and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually that even moved to middle school too.  It means dealing with these temptations and teaching how to use them as tools because they are there and cannot be ignored."
highschoolteachers,Can already teach middle. Have subbed in middle. My plans involve staying as far away from middle as possible. I don't do well with the level of hand holding involved below high school level.
highschoolteachers,"I was hired at my last two jobs because I got my foot in the door as a coach, so I advise all new teachers to get involved somewhere to prove their value and how well they work with kids.  However, in my experience, there are actually very few people who are hired strictly because they are a coach unless they are brought in as a head varsity coach. Schools usually find a job in district for them otherwise it would be nearly impossible for a school to get any coaching candidates from outside the district.  Non-coaching teachers often complain to me about this, but for a very large percentage of our kids, extracurricular activities are the best part of their high school experience.  Also, I think many of these kids learn as many life skills through these activities as they do in the classroom so I will never discount their importance. It sounds to me like you've just had bad luck because you are interviewing in places that need coaches.  If you want a job at those places, you're going to have to figure out a way that you can be valuable outside of the classroom.  Otherwise find a school that doesn't need you to do anything out of the classroom - we've hired plenty of teachers that do nothing outside of school.  Good luck. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt;I've lost 4 of them due to the singular fact that I cannot coach a sport and have no experience in any extracurricular activities.

You had to know this was going to happen though right? I mean... you didn't volunteer to help with a single extracurricular? 

It's not a requirement, and you can be a wonderful teacher without them, but as a first year it helps to get in the door. I played baseball in high school and I parlayed that into a volunteer coaching job with the school where I student taught. It showed employers that I was multifaceted and not only that, but that I was willing to work hard. Student teaching AND doing baseball is tough and showed I was willing to take on a lot of responsibility. 

It's going to take you longer to find a job, and that's okay. Hell, I didn't get my job until the end of July and I had to move two weeks before school started. Just hang in there... once you get that first job, volunteer to help with extracurriculars. You don't have to coach (though it's nice, and the right coach will take you on as an apprentice if you like a sport but don't have much experience) but you have to do something. Drama, yearbook, student newspaper, literary review, student council, etc. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt;40% of teachers change careers within a year of starting teaching. Why do you think this is?

It's an easy career to idealize. You go into it with dreams of making a difference, engaging in subjects you love, and yes, summers off. Then the cold, hard reality sets in. It's a tough job, but one that can be rewarding to the right mindset. 

I teach high school history. I love the content, I enjoy my job, but it's a challenge sometimes, and it's probably the most demanding job I've ever had. (I worked in the private sector for over 7 years before going back to school.) I'm sure a lot of people get into it and realize it's more challenging that they expected. 
"
highschoolteachers,"Sorry, but the supervisor at the college writing center is an easy choice to omit, leaving you with 5 left to choose from. 

Your cooperating teacher will be conspicuously absent if you're applying for jobs straight out of a teaching program. I would only use one though. I got a secondary license which qualifies me for middle or high school. I'm just taking a wild guess here, but I'm guessing that one of those teachers is at the high school level and one is middle school? If so, pick the one for the level you'll be teaching. If not, you may just pick the one with the better reputation, more experience, nicer writing...

Your student teaching supervisors presumably love you, their job is to make you sound as good as possible, so their letters may not hold as much water. I would skip theirs. 

The first two are obviously the strongest choices, followed by one of your cooperating teachers. 

That's my two cents anyway. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach in Saskatchewan and use Planboard from chalk.com, it's free and easy to use. The site also let's me add in curriculum outcomes, which is another think I love about it. I can also get ride of a day, if there's a PD or holiday, or bump lessons to other days. I can also copy lessons, which is helpful as a high school teacher with multiple sections most classes."
highschoolteachers,"I had THREE interviews at my old school in a 1 month span. I was currently subbing at both middle/high school. I knew several people on the panel, some from when I was a student. Each interview went great, and I was not picked for any of them. I wont lie, it was awful. I actually stopped subbing there cause I was so bitter. I did end up getting a full time pos. that November. So, vent all you want! "
highschoolteachers,"I think that's brilliant. At my high school, cell phones in class was against school policy, so it wasn't up to teachers to make their own system... but I think that this is a great way to be upfront about the issue and handle it in a way that treats the students like adults and lets them be in control of their choices. They are more likely to respect the ""red"" card when they've had freedom other days. "
highschoolteachers,"I haven't seen chalk in a classroom as the primary writing tool since middle school. I haven't seen overhead projectors since high school. Mind you, I'm just graduating college this week, so that's not much time, but I think technology TOOLS in education are moving rapidly.  

I student taught in a classroom with a smartboard last semester and I fell in love with it. My students are growing up in a world full of touch screens and iPads and apps and games and these tools are a great way to ""hook"" them in. 

I still loved my whiteboard and used it all the time, and I still love chart paper and use it all the time.... but smartboards are awesome as a new tool to further enhance learning. I don't see it as replacing whiteboards any time soon (for a number of reasons) but I see it augmenting existing tools in new and different ways.  

Document cameras are the same thing. I've had them in my classrooms since I was in high school, and student taught with them last semester and this semester. It is amazing being able to call a student up and have them put their math problem under the camera and we all discuss it together as a class... or when we're reading a text as a class, I can put my text under the document camera and students follow along.  

Honestly, it's because I never lived without these tools, so I don't know how to teach without them, but I would find teaching without a document camera to be very boring and difficult. Not a day went by without me using that. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school history.  When I was pregnant with my son the students were doing projects where they had to research a country that experienced a major historical event in the 20th century, and discuss the country in general as well as the event.  One kid did Poland and talked about their traditional food.  At the end I jokingly said he had made me crave perogies. At lunch time one of the male students in the class drove about 20 minutes to a place that sells perogies and brought them back for me. "
highschoolteachers,"We have regular, pre-advanced placement, and enrichment sections for math and ELA. Science and social studies do not have enrichment sections. Electives are on a 1, 2, 3 scheme like high school credits. "
highschoolteachers,"I don't know when/where you in particular went to high school, but in general i don't think it's a good idea for math teachers to settle for what's been typical in student performance over the last 20 years or so. C's in english aren't ""average"" last i heard"
highschoolteachers,"I think the thing teachers forget about the ""distraction"" of phones is that pencils and pens can lead to distraction as well.

I tried implementing a BYOD policy in the middle I'm in currently and it went nowhere fast. At least next year I'll be in the high school- I helped develop their current system"
highschoolteachers,"They probably just found the test too difficult and felt they could not earn a high enough score to get the college credit. They walked about because they may of felt like they were wasting their time. When I was in high school I took two AP exams, one in english and one in biology. My english teacher was not stellar, however I scored high enough to get 2 semesters of college credit. The biology... I scored the lowest possible score I could. I knew nothing. However I loved my biology class, I loved science, and I thought my teacher was pretty cool. I did not think she was a bad teacher, she just didn't prepare me for a standardized test. I went on to major in biology because I loved her class so much. In my freshman bio courses I was one of the few students to get an A in both because I learned it in my AP course. Just because they can't do a test does not mean you did not do your job."
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school physics teacher. I encourage my students to use their cellphone as a calculator, a stopwatch, a camera, and a notepad.

Do I catch students texting? Yes. Do they eventually have it open to a calculator or other useful app?  Yes. 

If they can't seem to keep from distracting, I simply ask them to put it away.

You would be amazed at the responses I got when I showed students how their calculator can go into landscape mode and increase all of their options."
highschoolteachers,"even this time of year, I couldn't imagine doing anything else and I have more fun every day than some people have their entire week.  

I teach high school social studies and enjoy myself immensely all the time.

Whats the reason for asking?"
highschoolteachers,"I don't have too much advice but I will say my high school physics teacher was amazing. First day of class we used baby food bottles stacked as a pyramid and a sheet of paper. We took turns pulling the paper out from under the bottles which led on to our lesson in friction. 
Every lesson he had for us was preceded by a simple, fun, and engaging experiment. We would use paper airplanes in the auditorium, spin on stools for centrifugal force, and so on. I enjoyed coming to class and learning. I guess all I am saying that engaging with your students always keeps them active and ready to learn."
highschoolteachers,I'm currently TEFLing in South Korea after teaching high school in New York. Definitely the best decision I've made in my recent life.
highschoolteachers,"Aw! Saying goodbye is tough if you've had a great relationship with your kids. 

I teach high school, but gosh darn if kids of any age aren't stoked about stickers. Seriously, 99 cents store stickers. Cut them up and hand them out. They will love it.

"
highschoolteachers,"&gt; Is it that obvious that it's my first year?

Not really- just an educated (ha, punny) guess since this post kind of lends itself to that. I'm sorry to hear about the situation at your school and non-tenure teachers getting fired, but hopefully it will open up some good opportunities elsewhere. And you're so right about the maturity thing. I had a lot of very mature high schoolers and a lot who weren't. I went in thinking, ""Okay, if I respect them as adults, then they'll just behave."" I was so wrong! In an ideal world, that might work, but I really needed stricter guidelines and then to loosen the reigns. Trying to tighten reigns midyear is like trying to put toothpaste in a tube. It was also really hard for me to not take things personally: nasty notes on teacher evaluations from students, some students not paying attention, etc. Even good teachers have those moments but I fixated too much on them and let them shake me. "
highschoolteachers,"/r/tefl is good. Really you can go anywhere in the world.  One reason I came here is that I had an opportunity to teach Bio/Chem, rather than just English, and it is relatively close to the United States if I needed to return home for some reason.  While physics isn't biology or chemistry, it is a science and if you have any basic understand of biology and chemistry, you can probably teach it at a high school level.  PM me for more info if you're actually interested!"
highschoolteachers,"I've had this happen during my time as a teacher more than once, but my story comes from when this happened to me as a high schooler. A young, vibrant, healthy student passed away in their sleep half-way through senior year. A well-respected but tough English teacher who taught the Journalism class this student had also been in with me and the deceased's two best friends said to us at the beginning of class the next day, ""We'll carry this pain with us for years to come, and it is a tragedy of the highest order, but we have a job to do. And with [them] in our hearts we will carry on.""

It felt cold to me at the time. The way they used ""but"" made it feel like a boss saying the firm lost an account instead of a school losing a person, but there was a sense of adulthood and maturity and responsibility I also felt that now convinced me it was the best thing they could have said. They weren't cold about it, and when students broke down the teacher was there to support them/find the professional support available, but it gave us a purpose. That was the best thing any teacher did and the only thing any teacher, counselor, or administrator said that I can still recall all these years later.

I'm sorry for your and your school's loss, friend."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the reply! When I briefly did TEFL, I had my own classroom and it was *so* different! I established my rules from day one, I got to decorate the classroom, I could teach 100% in the target language...it was amazing! Of course, I still had behavioral problems, but they were different too. It wasn't the 'out of control' feeling that I had in the states. 

I think student teaching is hard for a number of reasons...the students know you're not a real teacher yet, so you have like 'sub' status, you're not there the first day of class to see all of the rules and procedures be put in place, your space isn't really your own, etc. However I do know that some student teaching stuff was easier because my teacher took over more (putting in grades in the gradebook, etc.). But when you're student teaching the students might miss their old teacher and that was hard for me. They were used to one way of doing things and I can understand that anxiety of that being switched up! I never had student teachers in high school but I honestly don't think I would have liked them because I liked routine and stability. So I can understand the pushback that I got. 

Hopefully teaching 'for real' goes better but I know it has its own set of challenges too! It's refreshing to see someone who has been in the same situation though!

"
highschoolteachers,"First of all, being young usually doesn't help with classroom management as a high school teacher;  at least it didn't for me. My students viewed me as a peer, and in a way, I did too. I was very concerned about their perceptions of me,  and this interfered with my classroom management.  I didn't want to confront them because I wanted them to like me. Probably somewhere around my 4th year of teaching, I got over it. I suppose experience helped, but I slowly came to the realization that it was not my job to be their friend; it was my job to be their teacher. Yes, I can be friendly and goof around with them, but I need to view myself as being a mentor more so than a buddy. I also had to get over the confrontation issue. My advice is to fake til you make it. I forced myself to be assertive and not let things slide. Of course I pick my battles, but through your effort in building relationships with students, you'll know when it's okay to call a kid out in front of the class or when you need to address the matter quietly. After a while it becomes intuition.  As far as keeping your head above water, you have to come up with a routine. I utilize every minute of planning and down time while I'm at school. Whatever I do not finish goes home with me on the weekend, and I work on Sunday afternoons to get caught up. My family time is way too important to get bogged down with grading essays on a Tuesday night. Just remember that it takes time to figure out the tap dance, but once you get it, you'll actually enjoy teaching. And you'll appreciate the learning experience that got you there."
highschoolteachers,"The pay is all those things you do under other responsibilities.  Like attending back to school night, HS graduation if you teach high school, grading papers after hours etc.  Our union and district have a form we sign each year that documents possible activities we do to earn the TRI pay.hope this helps."
highschoolteachers,"Hi there and thanks so much for responding! What in your opinion made those first years so difficult? For me, student teaching was really tough because of behavior management but also because of curriculum. There aren't a lot of really good Spanish resources out there (not that I can find anyway!). With the new proficiency guidelines, a lot of the stuff that I could find like fill in the blank grammar worksheets weren't going to cut it. I felt like I was constantly having to re-invent the wheel and I'm still not too gung-ho about IPAs and the focus on authentic resources because it kind of leads you to reinventing the wheel. I felt like I could never get ahead with making materials, and they probably weren't very well-tailored because it's hard to make longer-term curriculum using authentic resources IMO. You have to really analyze authentic resources and scaffold the hell out of them for students to get them!

I've also realized how important rules and procedures are, and how there should be a procedure for everything : sharpening pencils, turning in papers, asking to go to the bathroom! I thought that high school students were mature enough to kind of just do their work but now I realize that they really need those rules, procedures and routines to feel safe and stay on task.

I think one of the most frustrating things about student teaching was instructionally, I felt like I learned nothing about teaching Spanish. My CT was a sweetheart but very set on the grammar-translation method and shot down TPR when I tried it. I also didn't have a projector and my teacher didn't really understand the need for one, so staying in the target language was really difficult. I got push back from different levels: the upper students got really freaked out by hearing Spanish and some of them had just 'checked out' and saw Spanish as a blow-off class. So I think some of them resented it. Some of the lower level students kept asking me why they had to translate all the time and they got frustrated, but my CT didn't want me to change her plans.

Anyway, it's great to hear that you love your job most days and that you feel that you are getting into a groove :-) After student teaching, I was ready to jump into another field (speech pathology) but I realize that field has problems too and I might actually like teaching if I give it another go...."
highschoolteachers,"I was in this position a year ago! There was an opening at my old high school, where the beloved senior English teacher who inspired me to go into (and stick with!) teaching was still teaching. 

I would simply send an email to the principal introducing yourself, being enthusiastic and mentioning that you'd love the opportunity to come back and teach at your old high school. I had many conversations with the principals at the school after I did this, and only missed out on the job due to interdistrict/school transfers and candidates that had more experience. 

So, it can happen. Best of luck to you."
highschoolteachers,"Where I went to school, that's a C. And a C is considered ""average."" I don't see the problem here. Sounds like a typical test when I took math in high school. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm assuming that you're a high school chemistry teacher?

Ordinarily, I think of my lab experiments the same way as I think about cooking a meal:

* I am often limited by what's in my pantry, and make substitutions or change what my experiment will be based on the supplies available.
* I put together shopping lists of small, cheap things based on what is currently available. Just a few supplements, like borrowing a cup of sugar from your neighbor.
* On the rare occasions where I have both the time, money, and motivation: I will pick a dish that I would love to sit all weekend eating, then put together a complete shopping list based on that dish. 
* There's also the ""responsible adult"" thing to do: only buy things that are on sale, and create a menu based on those things while at the market.

If I was given free reign, I would create my shopping list by picking the lab exercises that I would love to do. 

Also, don't underestimate the things that aren't lab specific: things that are really nice in any classroom. For example, decent computers, projectors, and productivity software on those computers. Also, there's these sweet mice that have gyro's in them so that they can be aimed by tiling them around in the air. They also have built in laser pointers. Very good for giving powerpoint presentations, but not sitting boredly behind your desk.

&gt;this all is my boyfriend posting, because the number one thing on my list is a better computer. "
highschoolteachers,"One thing I would like to point out no matter what you decided - 

I am a early-20s female who taught her first year at a fairly 'rough' high school (by no means the worst, but quickly headed that way according to many both within and outside the district). 

Make sure you do not come across like this mousy, fearful person. I always made sure to treat my students with respect. Always. At the end of the year I had more than a few students tell me they had not tried this much in previous classes, and that it was thanks to me treating them with that respect. 

Don't judge someone merely based on their neighborhood. Easy to say but year."
highschoolteachers,I teach high school.  Mainly freshmen who are quite the wild bunch to begin with... :/
highschoolteachers,"I used to fight this battle on a daily basis in a school where the administration is non-existent on the matter. I have finally realized that students currently in high school have never been without their phone. They only know what's it like to have it. Their parents don't understand this, and they do not know how to TEACH them to moderate their use. These kids aren't learning when it's appropriate and not appropriate to use their phone. Once I realized this, I changed my daily mantra. Instead of berating them for being rude or just getting angry, I started to explain to them that me standing at the board is an indication to put away the phone (and earphones). Every time I started class I would say, ""I am starting class now, and this is the time to put the phones away.""  I said this EVERYDAY for weeks before I noticed a difference, but wow!!! There are still students that need to be reminded occasionally (or everyday because they have an addiction), but my stress on the matter has gone from 8/10 to 3/10 in a matter of months. 

No research on this, but just my experience in a classroom of struggling and/or special education students. 

Tl;dr We need to teach the students when it is appropriate to use their phones and when they should put it way. Parents aren't necessarily doing this. "
highschoolteachers,"While a middle school may be more immature, high school might be more hostile. 

You definitely have to treat high schoolers in a poor school like adults because a lot of them have adult responsibilities. 

I don't know if this is your temperament, but the stereotype is you have to be more patronizing with young kids. You do high schoolers no favors 'cutting slack' - as a rule. Be strict, but more so, be reasonable. "
highschoolteachers,"I m gonna be honest...I'm prepping for an interview where one of the big things on the job description is data tracking. I have never really formally thought about it, and want to be prepared. 

Grades - I use an online grade book (powerschool). 

Writing - I believe in portfolios so students can also see progress/revisit feedback, and I've started these portfolios in the past with a student self-ranking on the rubric I use. We build them throughout the year and I urge students to review feedback with each new paper/major writing assignment.

I'm high school ELA...any other ideas? My approach to teaching focuses on writing, and I'm unsure what else I could discuss.

Edit - any thoughts on grading participation? I have a few ideas but am not sure how to be as objective as possible"
highschoolteachers,Thank you for this! I will be a first year teacher at a high school next year so I will be rereading this often.
highschoolteachers,Thank you for the response.  The position would be at all 4 elementary plus middle and high school.  Would a email short email to the superintendent be okay then? Or too much of a bother?
highschoolteachers,"I'd love to give my insight. How has your experience been? I feel high school is a much different experience of teaching in South Korea as compared to elementary.

**For background:** in New York I taught in the inner-city of Buffalo (the 4th poorest city in the state). In Korea, I teach in the farm villages of Jeju Island (some of the poorest areas of the island). I'm teaching the same grades of high school as I did in New York.  


- There are many similarities between the classrooms and education system. In both situations my students were tired, unmotivated, and disconnected. Luckily, I only worried about violence in my classroom while I worked in New York. Students from both locations are dealing with the effects of standardized testing and I can see the damage it's causing.


- I left New York because I felt undervalued, as a history teacher I felt that I wasn't able to enhance my student's current lives, and I wanted to be in an environment where education was more respected. In Korea I definitely feel more valued and education is more respected but as an English teacher I'm not enhancing the Korean student's lives. Since most of these students won't attend university they don't need to learn English; it's difficult trying to make a connection to why the material is important. This was the exact problem I faced in New York.


- The reason I'm choosing to stay in Korea rather than go back to New York revolves around my daily life. My class is ungraded and I have zero administrative duties - I went from working 60 hours a week with lesson planning and grading to working 40 hours a week with no time outside of school dedicated to the job. I have my Masters in education so it opens a lot of doors. I plan to continue teaching English outside of the United States for as long as I can. My goals now include: Abu Dhabi, Spain, South America, Thailand, and Vietnam. "
highschoolteachers,"Morning meeting (or something similar) should definitely be a part of your routine, especially if you're teaching the same class all day! I use morning meeting every day with my kids. However, since this person is specifically asking for start-of-class strategies to keep everyone relatively quiet while he/she takes roll for a high school science period, I decided to just mention review. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach self-contained special education at a high school and when my female student tells me ""you're so beautiful"" I smile and say ""I know"" and she just laughs.  Sometimes saying something like that jokingly afterwards helps eliminate some of the unnecessary compliments from students. Then we talk about compliments to give and compliments not to give. "
highschoolteachers,"This is my issue with my high school students as well. When I say things like that, I either get the pushback of ""what are you talking about, I was doing my work"" (meanwhile not even their name is on their paper) or it just goes in one ear and out the other. I do know that praising their good behavior individually works, but the whole class approach hasn't worked for me yet..."
highschoolteachers,"every day i rotate in one of my 'thinking' questions:
I put up 4 pictures and they have to decide which doesn't belong and WHY, or HOW they all go together and what you would add to the group, i put up analogies and have them create their own, word winks, etc. root word work- high school science is LITTERED with root word possibilities! You can do one a day, or different activities with a root each week. make it a 'known' things, routine, and they will just do it. Also- hey! Way to add language arts INTO science...you'll get super kudos for it.   ALSO- start the expectation EARLY that you need it quiet until bell. establish the routine and be SO STRICT about it the first 2 weeks. they will get the idea."
highschoolteachers,"Our progression is the same.  We have several high achieving students that double up on math to take Geometry and Algebra 2 at the same time so that they may take Pre-Calc junior year and Calc senior year since Pre-Calc is an entire year and Calc is also an entire year.  

Where I went to high school we had Honors/AP courses and it went like this... Honors Algebra 1, Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra 2, Trig/AP Calc.  The more traditional students took Algebra 1, Geometry, Alg 2, and then had the option to take what we called Math 4 which was kind of like a Pre-Calc type senario. "
highschoolteachers,"When I sub, I usually take them up at the beginning of every class if I'm subbing for high school and give them back at the end of the class. The schools just say the kids can't have them out, but don't ban them altogether. I just take it them up so that they don't have the impulse to check them all the time and then I have to keep it all day and turn it in. It's just a pain and it saves them in the end. I'm actually doing them a favor by helping. I do get mean looks and snide remarks, but I don't care. "
highschoolteachers,I also teach high school science. I use bell work. They generally have a question or sometimes prep work for a lab. If they don't get started right away they loose points and I check it once a week. 
highschoolteachers,"I teach Social Studies and Science, and my kids *love* trivia. They make a [hotdog foldable](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5103/5565771783_ecaf4f3e86.jpg) with six sections. They copy the day's multiple choice trivia question on the front, their guess to the question goes on the inside flap, and the correct answer goes on the inside. We do one at the beginning of each class. I work with a rough-and-tumble group of kids, and it took them all of two classes to get into routine with it. I just ask them to take out their hotdog, and the question's already on the board when they come in. At the end of the six trivia days, I take 5 questions and make a quiz. If they get 5/5, their name goes into a draw for a small prize. Our group of six trivia questions usually have a theme; sometimes it's directly connected to our content, and sometimes it's just a cool, off-topic thing we've discussed in class. You could up the number of questions to make it harder for high school."
highschoolteachers,"I assume you're not teaching so that high school kids can skip a semester of college science or so they can pad their GPAs.  I assume you're teaching science because you want to teach and you love science -- neither of those things have anything to do with the AP exams.

If you're judging your ability as a teacher by how much your kids care about a test, you're selling yourself short.  The least of your concerns should be how much they care about the AP exam.  They still learned from you, even if they didn't take the test at all.  

Plus, they're teenagers.  They don't have fully developed frontal cortexes -- the part of the brain responsible for complex decision making and consequential thinking literally hasn't finished growing yet.  Don't take it personally when a kid makes a bad decision."
highschoolteachers,"It seems to me that if you know this early that you want to teach, some good advice might be to figure out a way to get yourself a better-than-average deal. Either by being able to teach a relatively harder subject (or multiple subjects) or being able to coach a sports team as well or have a degree that makes you stand out or whatever. I've worked in underserved schools for a while so I am not saying that everyone should just flock to where the money is, but teaching at a relatively cushier, prestigious private school might for some be a better long term program than hacking away at the public school system or low-budget catholic schools or something. 

I know it sounds obvious as shit, but just figure out a way to be more valuable than your average Ed Major, Teaching Credential ""Teacher"" and you'll be treated as such. If you are a senior in high school, then you have tons of time to prepare. You could search job postings for teachers and see the types of people that schools are looking to hire and then base your undergrad and grad path around that. 

"
highschoolteachers,"The age cut-off is usually August. Since you were born after August of 1999, you would have had to wait to start kindergarten. You would be currently finishing up your freshman/9th grade year. However, as a high school teacher, I've noticed that most former homeschool kids end up being a couple years older or younger based on the credits they earned or how they tested. I currently have a 17-year old sophomore and a 20-year old senior; both are still behind."
highschoolteachers,"Downsides: it requires tremendous amounts of energy, patience, and time.  A sixteen-hour day is always going to be hard, but when six-seven of those hours is an intensive interaction with 30+ (or 40+) adolescents, it is a different level of sixteen-hour day.  Maintaining your energy and some semblance of balance in your life is the great challenge, particularly in your first few years.

Depending on your school you may have no support from home or helicopter parents; an administration that does not support you or attempts to micromanage your room; a group of cliquish colleagues who create as much drama as a pack of sixth-grade girls; violence in the halls, on the blacktop, and even in the classrooms; a school culture that promotes a cult-like status for the end-of-the-year standardized tests, etc.  Again, that depends entirely on the site.  You may find a combination of many of those; however, you could get lucky and face few, if any, of those elements.

The benefits: aside from all of the above things, if you find this is the profession for you and you begin to thrive, it is a great career.  If you truly like working with kids then it will be a great experience.  If you are passionate about your subject then (almost) every lesson and unit will be interesting to teach, especially if you have a lot of autonomy at your site.  In fifteen years, I've taught some lessons many, many times.  I find ways to make them interesting and a little bit different from year to year.  I find that history is a fascinating subject to teach and I haven't grown tired of it yet.  In most places you will be a social studies teacher so you will also be teaching a variety of other courses (at least at the high school level) throughout your career: geography, government, economics, sociology, psychology, etc.  And from year-to-year the specific history class you teach could change.  Oh, and those sixteen-hour days will disappear over time as you gain experience and have planned your year.  

I would recommend volunteering in classrooms when you can to get a feel for what things are like.  This will also allow you to network a little with teachers and find out what things are like from their perspective.  Good luck."
highschoolteachers,"I like the crazy amount of work but realistically my student loans are a quarter of my pay and I had it pretty good. I have another friend who is also a first year teacher and her loans are more now than they were when she graduated. 

The benefits were a lot better when I first decided to go back to get a teaching license but that varies from state to state and district to district (like most things).

You really need to want to do this job because you love being with kids and want to help them succeed. The future isn't the brightest for teachers in many states. You have to do a lot of work, a lot of training, a lot of paperwork you may or may not even agree with and you will be consistently scrutinized and judged. You will be held to unobtainable standards affected predominately by factors outside of your control. 

My friend who wanted to teach high school history took 4 years after graduation to actually get a job and she had to do some serious networking to even get that. 

"
highschoolteachers,"As stated by others, social studies is saturated. I recommend doubling up social studies and English. Common core is moving toward project based learning, and Humanities classes are becoming common. You'd have a leg up with both, and I think knowing the time period behind literature would be fantastic. I'm in CA and I hear the history CSET is brutal, but I'm considering doing it to force myself to learn some gosh darn history.

The first thing I'd suggest doing is that you should volunteer at schools. Observe and aid. Elementary, middle, and high school are all different beasts, and you won't know where you truly fit until you've been in the thick of it.

Second, if you just like history, please don't teach. I say this with all my love, but just having admiration for content won't make you a great teacher. Have that AND a love of communication. You'll have to do it a lot! Parents, kids, admin, counselors, staff..."
highschoolteachers,"I absolutely love my job, and I look forward to work every single day.  On sunday nights, I'm in a good mood because I get to to go to school tomorrow.  People told me that it's a rewarding job, but I had no idea.  I just ran into a student's mom at the store yesterday and she brought me to tears thanking me for having such a positive impact on her son.  Moments like that are amazing.  My wife was with me as well, so it was cool for her to see that...  I teach history, and kind of take a school to life approach to my job and always try and prepare my students for the real world.  We will discuss things like credit cards, credit scores, taxes, politics, jail, etc.  I know I'm going to be spending the next 30+ years in my room, so I might as well have fun with it.  

Negatives: work place drama can get a little overwhelming if you let it get to you.  Teachers tend to be bigger gossipers and babies than the students.  Certain kids you won't reach, which is a bummer.  Certain kids will hurt your feelings and you won't be able to stop thinking about them.  I had a trouble student last year that I would think about at 3 am, on vacation, etc.  I couldn't get that kid out of my head.  I finally addressed it and it got better, but it sucked for a bit.  On a grand scale, there will be kids who get into accidents or die, which is one of the worst things a teacher can experience.  I'm a high school teacher, so it's a little more likely for me, but there is a major accident every 4-8 years and it's extremely devastating to everybody involved.  "
highschoolteachers,"You have an edge in that they know you and more than likely observed you teach. The next step is to make yourself more valuable than someone else who is applying. Be positive. Even if you are unsure of how to answer a question, stay confident and try your best. 
To me differentiation meant finding a way to teach all learners. No matter the level, how will you reach that student. I had a 5th grader who needed help in phonics. I have also had 5th graders read at a high school level. What do you do to help all of them? How will you pull your strugglers up and push your advanced students further? 
Don't forget about accessing school and community resources. Perhaps they have a mentoring program available, or access to tutors or hourly teachers. Most teachers reach out to others to meet the needs of their students. You can't do it all on your own and they may be impressed that you are knowledgeable about those that can help.
Classroom management is also a huge concern that you may want to highlight. Bring in your classroom management plan and explain how you will ensure that students meet your expectations. Building classroom culture can be done to prevent management issues. List some ways that you can build a community of learners.
Best of luck! Every interview adds experience, so look at it as an opportunity.
"
highschoolteachers,"Nope, not everybody can do it. 

That being said, I think more people can do it than is generally accepted. 

I have mixed feelings when I hear something like this. 

There are people who could come right out of high school and be a teacher. We often hear a 4-year degree in education is a waste of time and money, and I believe in that too. My ""higher education"" started when I was in the classroom. I think education should become a 2-year apprentice style program with a Master Teacher showing the way.

To your sister, I would say, ""Go for it then. Become a teacher. Replace the teacher you wish your son/daughter had. Be the change you want to see in the world.""

On another note, I teach my kids, ages 8 and 11 more in the summer than they learn in 9 months of the classroom. I use Khan Academy and work only 1 hour a day with 1 to 1 individualized attention with me. They are both reading and doing high school math. So their teacher has not done as much for them as I have.

But make no doubt, teaching is a tough gig. And I doubt your sister could do it.

"
highschoolteachers,"I wouldn't trust someone to be a teacher if they ""let something happen"". It really isn't that difficult to just say ""no"" to a student who *you* are the authority over. You are *in locus parenti* over a student, not a potential date. 

I understand that some high school girls and boys are hot, and some smarter and more mature than others, but you are a substitute parent to these people. By getting involved with them you are hurting them and hurting your career. They don't need you to be their boyfriend or their lover, they need you to be their teacher. 

They especially don't need a teacher who is willing to throw their career and professionalism away over a little bit of sex with a student. If this guy wants to meet women he can join a club or go to a bar. 

An extra problem, for me, is that the authority of teaching tends to give you kind of an attractiveness bonus: it can boost your self-confidence and make you feel ""popular"" or ""cool"" if all these 16-18 year olds are looking at you. It's partly for that reason why this is entirely dangerous to flirt with a student: it's not a normal relationship at all to have power over someone while also trying to have sex with them. It's coercive and very weird. 

Personally, when I first started student teaching I was young and naiive and struggled with my attraction towards some of my students. After looking at myself honestly and who I wanted to be, I trained myself to see my female students as younger sisters or nieces: someone who I am charged to take care of. 

If I am distracted by their bodies it really ruins the whole dynamic of trying to get them to develop ethics and critical thinking. 

In the end, if you are still attracted, keep your fantasies to yourself and work it out in the bathroom when you get home! Let fantasy be fantasy and let reality be reality.

I think we can both understand why your friend did what he did, but I hope that you also realize it was irresponsible and actually quite coercive and predatory, and that, as a teacher, he should *never* be a passive entity in *anything*. 

Is he also ""letting"" students not turn in homework, hit other students, yell out in class, not take exams?"
highschoolteachers,"Interesting question and not something I've even considered let alone been exposed to. As a still fairly young teacher I could never imagine it because I have been (and still am) closer in age to my high school students than their parents. 

I do have a divorced coworker who went out on an online date and discovered her date was the father of a student in the school (but not her student - yet). That relationship didn't make it past one date, but I don't think it was because of the student connection. 

I wonder if single 28-33 year old elementary school teachers have any awkward or hilarious or uncomfortable stories. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school and people in this thread aren't mentioning the possibility that HS teachers can have multiple preps (teach multiple subjects) too. I am an English teacher and I have 4 preps. Everyone saying it evens out with planning/grading between elementary/secondary aren't taking that into account. I spend a lot of time prepping and planning for 4 subjects and then grading essays for all 4 subjects. But then again, it really depends on your school. "
highschoolteachers,"A little more context please. Is this High School or College?

At the high school level, I have a very lax late policy in first semester. It gets a bit stricter in third quarter and nonexistent by fourth. My rationale is that you are getting acclimated to expectations. However, by fourth quarter, testing has pretty much dictated a lot of my grading time. I plan assignments/projects around days when both you and I are not encumbered by excessive exams or testing. Also, I refuse to pull my hair out grading old assignments the last few weeks of school because the student suddenly realized their obligations. 

It might seem cold and harsh, but this is a real world lesson. After all, your future boss is likely not going to give you any make up time for coming in late to work. They'll simply fire you and find someone else. The real world is harsh. "
highschoolteachers,"I went to a private catholic college prep school for high school so I know the experience as a student, though if I had to choose I'd rather have the parents over involved with their son or daughter's education than none at all. A big problem at the school was the lack of parent involvement."
highschoolteachers,"I've taught all three. Here's a very simplified breakdown. 

Elementary. Easy subject material, but you have to develop significantly more lessons. Marking is relatively easy. Students are nice,  but immature, and need constant refocusing. 

Middle. Harder subject material, but still easy to get. Assessment is difficult because students rebel more. Students are challenging, by highly rewarding when they are interested and engaged. Relationships key. 

High. Hard subject material, hard to start learning without background knowledge. Difficult assessment, lots of material and in depth answers. Students are nice as long as you are reasonable and create relationships. Able to joke around more as adults. 

Very, very basic answer. Of all three, high school has actually become my favourite. "
highschoolteachers,"Yep. Increase your class sizes and expect you to differentiate for every single student and increase ""discussion &amp; questioning techniques"" etc. in the classroom.... It's a little hard to differentiate in a 45 minute period with 34 students in high school chemistry. "
highschoolteachers,"I just graduated with an Elementary Education degree, so smaller kids, but I've been there, recently. I'm also substituting, including high school, so it's like the first day of field placement every day! I was incredibly nervous, to the point of nausea, and I still feel uneasy every day I leave my house to sub. For me though, all the nerves just disappear as soon as I start teaching. The training you've had and the preparation you've done just kind of take over. 

My advice would be to get a good night's sleep, wake up early, and know that at the end of the day, even if your lessons/class management failed terribly (been there), you did the best you could and you'll just keep getting better. 

Also ask your cooperating teacher as many questions as you can thing of. "
highschoolteachers,"Every time I see a boy reading a book for pleasure in my high school it is science fiction.  Anything science fiction.  I looked at this one book and the boy, a senior, got almost embarrassed and said ""I like fake things, like aliens and sword fights and magic and war"" and I responded with ""Are you kidding me?  I LOVE science fiction!"" and we got into a whole conversation about things he's read in the last year.  It was great.  I had no idea he was a reader like that.

So... science fiction.

Also for the lower readers - Goosebumps."
highschoolteachers,"Wow. Is it the only district in the area?! I'm fortunate enough to live within reasonable driving distance of at least ten districts. 

I understand you on tough end of the year, I am in high school and have a countdown on my phone for graduation. Can't do it for the last day of school because snow keeps pushing it back. And just found out I'll have to stay an extra half hour a day starting very soon. I might die. 

Hang in there!"
highschoolteachers,"lol, that's funny, because I used to do this. I was always pretty well prepared in high school and college, and I always found it insulting when ""essay"" questions were so absurdly simple. So as my pathetic revenge, if there was no word limit, I would write down absolutely everything I knew about the given topic in the time we had, to make the teacher/prof have to read all this stupid shit, and also potentially to mess up any curve.  "
highschoolteachers,"This is a problem I am running into as a first year high school teacher in a small town. I have six different preps with one hour used for planning. That one hour generally gets used up doing tech stuff, because of course I do tech stuff too. But at least I have next year, 6 entirely different classes again. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math (alg 2 and precal) am married and have an 8th grader and a 1st grader.

It's not easy- my first few years I brought lots home- if it was multiple choice, my husband helped me grade, otherwise, I worked after kids were in bed.

I've learned to grade and plan more efficiently and I go in early to get work done, but I've almost completely quit working from home. It's a trap.

That said, I do go to school for a few hours each Sunday. 

Home is home. Dinner is important- we all stop everything and sit down to eat together and my kids have pretty specific bedtime ""rituals"" - then my husband and I sit down and watch a show before we go to bed. 

Carve out specific times in your day that are sacred. Schedule a day each week to start with- and then stick with it! It was hard for me to learn to ""turn off"" the school part of my brain at first, but life is so much better when I am fully engaged with my family when I am around them :)

Also- deleting my school email account from my phone was the best thing I ever did! "
highschoolteachers,I just wanted to echo your post (I am also a teacher of high school English and creative writing) and say that we pretty much *have* to have a date night in order to remain vaguely functioning.  (Ours is Thursday.)  It doesn't necessarily mean that we go out; it just means that we dedicate that night to each other.
highschoolteachers,"I am not married, but my boyfriend works in television and thus we have an incredibly diverse schedule. What I have found works is that I will reserve at least one day during the week and at least one day during the weekend where absolutely no school work is to be done once I get home. No grading, no e-mails, nothing. Usually one of these days is reserved as a date night which I would also recommend if you have a babysitter available and within your means. I have found that this schedule not only works in the favor of my relationship, but also my mental fortitude. Since I teach high school English, creative writing, and journalism, it is extremely easy to get bogged down in grading. 

Considering that you have young children, I would recommend spending Friday nights as family nights where the children can select activities on a rotational basis. Obviously you would select for the toddlers until they are old enough, but it will be a nice tradition that you can carry on. 

In short, it is very important that you schedule alone time and family time. I would recommend at minimum two nights a week, but that is entirely dependent on what winds up working for you."
highschoolteachers,"As someone who teaches high school health, I would never make a sub do that lesson. That is just plain mean. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for your explanation. This makes total sense.

I have another question for you. (I'm genuinely very interested in educating people, I teach martial arts and I used to teach high school English (martial arts is much more personally rewarding for me).)

What if we keep giving people a passing grade to encourage them, when actually the work is subpar of the average -needed-  skill level, do we not just produce lesser capable people who have the same identification mark as those who are capable? It'll be hard to differentiate later just by paper, who is better suited for task X because everyone is judged without relationship to each other. E.g a B for John is then not the same as a B for Patrick, but you can't see from this data, who is a real B and who is really an F but we wanted to encourage them. What if these people then go do important jobs, based on their perceived idea of what they know, maybe a job where they can risk the safety of others? 

Is this not a problem?

Example: I would not give someone a belt up just because they worked so hard, because when they compete next, unless they really are at that level, they're going to get smashed or even hurt as they then have to compete at that level."
highschoolteachers,"I understand what that blog is saying, but it would also be irresponsible to not be upfront with people wanting to go into teaching about the kind of horror show it can be from day to day.  A lot of good teachers are leaving the profession because they want to do what's right but literally are unable to do so.  

If they do what they think is right they'll be shown the door if it's not exactly what their district wants them doing; if they can't do what they think is right they're choosing to leave anyway.

My district is great and gives me a lot of freedom, but I'm in the high school.  In all of the elementary schools now it doesn't matter what a teacher wants to do, the district buys a program and that's what the teachers have to do."
highschoolteachers,"It probably depends upon my student as far as who really understands the mechanics behind it. The algorithm that I use is:

New score = old score + sqrroot(300-3(old score))

For example, let's say that on Unit 1, you received a (really really bad) score of 20%. Your new goal would be 20 + sqrroot(300-3(20)) = 20 + 15.49 = 35.49. 

Let's say you the next unit you meet this goal and get a 36%. Your new goal will be to get a 49.85. If this pattern continues, then the next unit would be 62.24, then 72.67, then 81.72, etc, etc.

It gives my kids a reasonable goal for their next unit test without it being overwhelming. Please note that I teach high school math, so I recognize this wouldn't always be feasible. I also always encourage my kids to aim for higher scores than the one given by the algorithm."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math, and I usually let my kids sit in different spots (I have some pillows and cushions if they want to sit on the floor) while I'm talking, move desks around to sit in small groups, or I will have them rotate in a 'speed dating' pattern when I want them to talk about answers to complex problems. Sometimes they complain, but I think a lot of them appreciate something different than the traditional 'sit down and pay attention' method. "
highschoolteachers,"I completely agree with the 2nd part of your post. However, how could you ever justify a passing grade for this in high school? Not only is the structure of the writing terrible, there is not even a single correct sentence in the mix. Unless this kid is 5-8, this should not be a passing paper, regardless of the message/content.

I'm not an English teacher (anymore/only taught English as a foreign language) so maybe I'm not seeing something here? 
"
highschoolteachers,My colleague (suburban high school) does this and it seems really fun and successful. She mainly relies on [this book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435458443/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=21Y52T9NRLV7E&amp;coliid=I304HS2HHYVTKH). 
highschoolteachers,"Wow... I really love this idea.  Think there's a max age for whom it would apply?  I have some high school freshman I think it would work with, but after that... not as much."
highschoolteachers,"Last summer I did a week of ProD, a week visiting my parents and high school friends, and a month backpacking around Europe.

This summer I will be working on my Master's for a week, visiting my parents for two weeks, and then moving."
highschoolteachers,"It's tough.  There's a lot of ""homegrown"" talent you'll be competing against for the rare slot that does open up.

Your best bet, if you want to call it that, is to look at the struggling districts and title 1 schools.  My experience has been that they like to hire outside of their current employees with the idea that they'll bring in new ideas to turn things around.  It's probably the most stress-inducing, meat-grinder of a job, however, and you should plan on keeping on the move the first decade or so in order to not get tagged with failing school status.

Teaching experience is generally good, but not essential apparently.  I still can't wrap my head around this, but principals do get hired despite having never taught.  Note that these principals are often resented by their staff.  You *should* be ok with your six years, although I prefer 10 before I start considering somebody seasoned enough to lead myself.

You'll probably want to put some thought into teaching either elementary or high school.  If all of your years are at the middle school level, theoretically that only leaves middle school positions for which you'd be seriously considered.  Again, this isn't in stone, but it's come up.

As far as targeting private/charter schools, it's hard to say.  They've also got an astonishing churn rate.  I know generally it's hard to keep teachers in there for more than a couple of years before moving on and I've heard the leadership turnover is pretty high as well.  It's probably the same issue as title 1 public schools - nobody wants to be the one to go down with the ship so they put in there couple of years and move on.

STEM is currently in vogue and you may be able to use that to your advantage.  I'm not certain if this is nationwide, but my state has regional ""Math/Science"" centers that are meant to direct and guide STEM curriculum.  Sounds kind of hokey but they're actually pretty big deals - again I'm not sure if it's universal, but ours at least serves a half dozen school districts and then serves as sort of a career center for students who want to attend a portion of the day in order to focus on more serious science/math classes.  They tend to have a lot of oddball administrative-ish jobs like coaching, curriculum development, and of course running the center itself.  Your background would serve you very well in this regard.

You could also investigate outdoor learning centers/camps.  Just be aware you're not going to get paid anything remotely decent unless you pull the director position down."
highschoolteachers,"*  6th Grade:  They are still children.  You can ""shape"" them into the kind of middle school kids you want them to be.  Make their transition to middle school easy and encourage them to always do their best in this new world.

*  7th Grade:  They still need your encouragement.  They think they are mature and can be pretty mean to each other, but they still want your approval.  If you are a firm but fair teacher, these kids will rally around you and do their absolute best to please you by doing and acting their best.


*  8th Grade:  Really growing up now.  They don't need your approval so much, but they respect that you know what they need to learn because their next step is high school.  Treat them like the young adults they are.  Give them some freedom within the classroom.  Be firm and fair...and have a sense of humor...and now they will do their best...not for you...but because you taught them it is for THEM.

*  9th Grade:  Little fish in a big pond.  All that 8th grade poise is lost.  They need you to guide their first steps into high school, but still need some freedom to make mistakes.  They sort of lag sometimes because people think they should be more mature than they are.  Give them encouragement and they will try their hardest.

*  10 Grade:  Growing up.  You are there to teach them.  They don't really need your approval or you to be much of a part of their day.  Your job is to share the knowledge they need to get to the next step on their journey toward college or career.  They are nice, though, because they are genuinely maturing and will listen to your advice because you are not their parent, so you must know what you are talking about."
highschoolteachers,"You say you've taught everything from 6-10, which is all of middle and half of high school. If you don't mind me asking, if you could mention anything specific that makes each ""great in its own way"", what would it be for each grade?"
highschoolteachers,"Edjoin.org is where all the public positions are posted for California. That can sometimes be a good resource to see how many jobs are available during the typical hiring season. 

I'm in preschools, but anecdotally, I have a friend (in San Diego) who's been looking for a high school science position for two years since he received his credential. He got one long term sub position (at the high school he graduated valedictorian from) but otherwise has only been able to be a daily substitute. He's starting to feel discouraged, though I'm not sure the direction the state will move in in the next few years. "
highschoolteachers,"I came here to post the same thing.  Group grades for projects are bullshit (see this article for great reasons why:  http://www.kaganonline.com/free_articles/dr_spencer_kagan/269/Group-Grades-Are-Pointless), and personally, I would kick up a bit of a fuss if they were being assigned to my child.  I teach in a project-based high school and do many group projects, but I never ever assign group grades."
highschoolteachers,"My English teacher in high school paused the 1968 version to point out the boob. I guess she kept the guys interested that day. We watched both versions and I loved it. Hamlet was my favorite, though. "
highschoolteachers,"I dont think this is a very positive attitude. If you don't care, why should they? I teach Québec history in high school. There are some part of history that I find downright boring, but I still teach it like it's the most exciting thing I have ever seen."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah. I mean, I don't hate his work, but I don't get the way it's idolized while other great works are disregarded. I remember looking at the common core standards and noting that high school teachers should be including what they've decided is basically canon. In a departure from other standards, specific works are mentioned. Oh, what's in there? Historical documents and... Shakespeare. That's pretty much it. "
highschoolteachers,"I think it has a lot to do with historical significance. A lot of his stories are lifted from much older things, but *his* version is the one that really cemented those stories in history. That's one reason to pick his versions, although I don't know how much the people that made this decision considered that. I think it's mostly due to the fact that his work is so easy for a high schooler to analyze, or at least extract a lot of literary elements. That seems to be most of the purpose of high school english, but idk I'm not an english teacher."
highschoolteachers,"Of course not but the previous comment of making sure they have adequate access at the school is spot on. Even in my school, I utilize an online homework system. I teach calculus and I use university of texas online homework system(they let high schools use it). While it's awesome and a lot of my kids love it, theres a good portion that I have to print out paper copies for(the system makes unique problem sets for each individual)."
highschoolteachers,At the high school level here the most common pattern of errors is end-of-sentence punctuation.
highschoolteachers,"check out [Illustrative Mathematics](http://www.illustrativemathematics.org/). Its really the best site I've found for understanding the standards.

Also, the [Common Core flip books](http://katm.org/wp/common-core/) are great. They have one for high school and one for each grade k-8"
highschoolteachers,"I was a very successful physics teacher. I highly recommend against flipping your classroom. It was designed for college students to solve a very specific problem that doesn't really apply to high school students.

My suggestion is to change your instructional strategies. As you research strategies, its common for high school teachers to dismiss activities (like Kagan strategies) as ""too elementary"". Don't fall for it. They may seem childish to you, but they work.

In addition to Kagan, look into the SIOP model. It was designed for English learners but is really good for all students. 

PM me if you want some more specific suggestions and some examples of how to use it in physics. "
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school a few years ago, it was my sophomore year I believe, I ended up posting a pic of a teacher online of them drawing something on the whiteboard with a caption. Somehow, the teacher got word of it (probably because I was friends with a few of my old teachers on fb), and he ended up sitting the class down and talking about online etiquette and whatnot. 

He didn't call me out on it in class, but he strongly implicated me, and everyone knew it was me anyways because they had seen the pic. I was thoroughly embarrassed, mainly because I didn't mean any harm by the pic, but that I also go caught. The teacher and I had a good talk about it (he knew that I wasn't a bad kid and thought the behavior odd), and ended up putting it in the past and moving on.

So really, it depends on the type of kid they are. Sometimes an act to get some attention can go too far!"
highschoolteachers,"It's sad. I'm not a teacher, but stuff like that (in my opinion) is the reason why kids get a bad education sometimes (or a deteriorating one, in any case). If a teacher knows (or suspects) they can get fired or in deep trouble just because some kid gets a bad grade and complains about it, it could potentially lead to inflated grades. I know when I was in high school, it definitely happened (at my school anyway). 

I think the world would be improved significantly if kids were flunked when they write a shitty essay or fail a test. And no manner or complaining should be able to do anything to change it. Outside of legitimate bias toward particular students or legitimate unfair practices in the classroom I don't think there should *ever* be a reason to side with a student or parent over a grade.

I guess my consolidated point is: No teacher should ever have to even think about the possibility that they could get fired or punished because some student got riled-up about something or a parent tried pulling some strings.

Perfect world, there. Too bad we don't live in it."
highschoolteachers,"Hi OP,

I work in Adult Basic Education at a nonprofit. One thing that your clients might not know about is the availability of free quarter length GED practice tests available on the GED website here: [Free Practice Tests](http://www.gedtestingservice.com/educators/freepracticetest)

Those will give them an idea of what to study and what the tests look like. 

My organization focuses on physical classes, but students studying from home might benefit from taking math classes online at Khan Academy. They can also go to most public libraries and find GED study books, but any high school level math, writing, reading, social studies and science text books will help. 
"
highschoolteachers,"I was 12. I loved my teacher that year. Sitting in my class one day I just looked around and noticed that everyone was obviously happy and enjoying the class because of the enthusiasm of this teacher. I decided at that point that I wanted to teach and have this effect on students. I wanted all students to enjoy their classes as much as I enjoyed this one. From then, as I progressed through high school I refined my choice from 'teacher' to 'math and/or science teacher' after recognising my love for the subjects"
highschoolteachers,"I think I can shed a little light on this subject...I currently homeschool my kids.

We always hear the 'socialization' question regarding homeschooling, but let me let you in on something.  No one actually wants to sit at home with our kids all day not interacting with anyone.  No.  One.  I literally have NEVER met a homeschooling parent who doesn't want to socialize with other parents and let their kids interact with other kids.  

The most common ways most homeschooling families socialize are: 

1.  Church (for religious homeschoolers).  I know some people who are at church with their kids almost every single day at some time of the day.  Youth group, bible study, sunday services, wednesday services, choir practice, etc.  

2.  Homeschool groups.  Everyone I know is a member of at least 1 homeschool group.  Our homeschool groups usually have several monthly book clubs for a variety of age ranges, a movie night or 3, potluck/picnic/park days (usually around lunchtime) once a week, board game night, monthly field trips etc.  

3.  Co-op.  Almost every family with older children that I know participates in co-op.  In areas that have a lot of homeschooling families, people group together and teach classes, enroll their kids in the classes, and do this between 1-3 times a week, depending on the age range.  High school aged children's co-ops more closely represent high school classes - less 'discovering nature' and more 'algebra 1' and textbooks.  

4.  Organized sports and lessons.  Soccer, gymnastics, dance, baseball are all very popular with the people we know.  Lessons like guitar and piano are also popular.

So the difficulty is not that there aren't many ways to socialize.  Usually the socialization problems that a homeschooling parent deal with are a) exclusionary groups based on specific religions.  Many of the groups force you to sign a waiver agreeing that you not only are a christian, but that you believe in very specific tenants of christianity that the group founder(s) believe in, such as opposing homosexuality.  and b) sorting out the 'good stuff' from the 'fluff' and trying to ensure you aren't wasting your time on useless activities.  Figure out a way to tackle those two issues (and the religious group one really isn't hard at all) and everything from there is fairly simple.  If there's funds to hire a group activities organizer instead of relying on busy parents to volunteer time to organize activities whenever they feel like it, your groups will be on rails.  

Biggest struggle with online learning is locking out access to the general 'internet' and gaming while doing schoolwork.  Electronic ways for the kids to connect socially are generally ignored.  Pretty much no one wants their kids to have access to internet while they are completing schoolwork.  "
highschoolteachers,"What's your relationship with the kid? What's the picture?

For example, is it a kid you like/who likes you, and a funny picture of you with a goofy hat on? Or is it the kid who never talks and kind of stares at you oddly and it's a picture of you in your bar/clubbing outfit?

I took a picture of one of my favorite teachers in high school--she was our Spanish teacher, a wonderful lady, and it was during our trip to Mexico. I had bought a bottle of cream tequila for my parents (with everyone knowing what was going on), and my teacher had to carry it back in and through the US. So she stopped to pick it up, and someone thought it would be funny for her to pose with a cigarette and this booze bottle. Funny picture, we all laughed, and *only thought she was cooler*. Had I had a computer screen with a background, I would have considered that as a pic. (Now, in that case, maybe it wouldn't have been so good for her...smokes and booze and all :)

But you get my point. Not creepy. But I could easily imagine creepy."
highschoolteachers,"Wrote above that I still have seniors in high school doing this. I had a class meeting with them one day where I said basically, ""In this essay, it doesn't matter what you think. Tell me what you know."""
highschoolteachers,"Whenever I briefly define an unfamiliar word in the flow of lecture (high school students, Literature/Bio/Chem) I write it on the board, ask students to break it down into prefix-root-suffix for me, ask for definitions of each part, and then ask a student to put them together into a definition, which I then either modify or approve. Then I use it in a sentence if it's still unclear, and ask a couple students to use it in a sentence. Then, I quickly call for another word that has the same root/prefix, and ask how it's related.

All that generally takes a minute, students add it to their notes, and I they say that connecting vocab to other words via roots really helps!

Also, if it's a Latinate root and relevant, I call for French/Spanish-studying students to connect it to a French/Spanish word. It's about 80% of my students, and it trains them to cross-apply language skills."
highschoolteachers,"I did an arts degree because I was unsure if I wanted to be a teacher and it gave me 3 years to decide. The 3 year undergrad degree finished last year and I finally decided that I couldn't envision myself being anything other than a high school teacher. 

So if i'm going to become a teacher, why not do it at [the 3rd best ranked school for education in the world?](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2013/education-and-training) :)"
highschoolteachers,"I agree with this. 

My sister was in high school when our dad was murdered, and the teachers didn't do a whole lot about it. It would *really* help to allow flexible, but within reason, due dates and allowing the student to leave the room if needed. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm double-posting on this thread...the hardest concept for high schoolers is when it's appropriate to use personal pronouns.  If i could tell elementary and, especially, middle school L A teachers one thing, it would be this: stop letting them write ""I think"" and ""I believe"" before they hit high school!  I can beat the rest of the pronouns out of their formal writing in a year if you give me that headstart!"
highschoolteachers,have you ever had one of your high school kids come to the bar?
highschoolteachers,"As a teacher, as a young 22-year-old who teaches high school, this bothers me a lot. That teacher could have lost her job. I know where I'm at, if there was even a suggestion of impropriety, the teacher would be pulled out of class so quick. Even before the report was substantiated.

People lose their jobs over this. I've been told I don't know HOW many times to be extra on-guard because I'm a female and I'm young, and I'm ""unfortunate"" enough to have wanted to teach high school. So this just bugs me that he doesn't seem to think anything of what he did. It's a joke to him maybe, but not to the teacher being implicated."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school my school had a French exchange student exactly like this. 

He would rant about how he hated America, the specific town he was sent too, he hated the school, swore at teacher in French thinking nobody would realize what he was saying.

He went through three host families in the short time he was in America. He was sent back to France way before his program was scheduled to end because of his behavior at the school and families didn't want to host him. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach both high school and college full time (college is primarily online through a very reputable and respected public university--not a for-profit).  I've also found that there is often so much work I could do that I have to turn some of it down.  At one point (and this is really crazy), I was a high school teacher, college professor, yearbook advisor, program director at the high school, chair of creative writing at the college, and the acting director of English at the college--all at the same time.  "
highschoolteachers,A can that probably should be opened.  There is tremendous disparity--elementary teachers being paid the same to teach 25 kids as high school teachers for being paid to teach 150 students.  English teachers grading 1000+ papers per year at 500 additional hours of work vs. gym coaches with no such responsibilities.  That can of worms should be opened and dissected.  
highschoolteachers,"I find this interesting, because at my high school an A for English is beyond rare - you see a 90-100 English grade for maybe 1 student in 60, and their writing is at an exceptional standard."
highschoolteachers,"I feel like this is one of those situations where the student's behavior is best described by that Big Lebowski meme - you know, ""you're not wrong, you're just being an asshole."" I also teach SpEd social studies, as well as gen-ed and CTT classes, so the following is how I would deal with this situation. Feel free to modify or pick and choose from my strategies, as I am sure you are a caring professional and can evaluate which techniques may be more or less effective based on your teaching persona and relationship with the student.

1. **Acknowledge that the student is correct - the way their classes have been planned is bullshit.** It sounds like you have already taken this step, and even better that you have actively tried to advocate for this student (awesome!). You have clearly done a great job of bringing this student's concerns to the admins. Have you communicated this to her? Often I find my students become much more receptive and understanding when I lay out exactly what steps I have taken on their behalf, as well as communicating clearly what is and is not within my power (e.g. no, I can't change your classes but I can bring up the issues you've been having at our weekly department meeting to see if they can be resolved in some way).

2. **Explain that you know the American educational system is full of bullshit, and be honest about your frustrations with it (especially those that include her!)** It sounds like some of her complaints may be based on a little bit of culture shock. I have been very taken aback by societal/cultural standards when I traveled as an adult, and I can only imagine how much more intense it would be to go through the same thing while also having to navigate a foreign educational system as a 17yr old. Again, it sounds like you have done a good job of understanding her frustration and doing what you can to meet her needs. It may ease the friction if you communicate in a more explicit way that you *agree* with many of her points, and that you are frustrated as well because you have to deal with the fallout from the both sides. This is also another chance for you to point out examples of your advocacy for her, and specify ways that she can advocate for herself.

3. **Encourage the student to advocate for herself.** Based on your description of her, she does not have a problem with being soft-spoken. While this can be a pain in the ass for you to deal with on a day-to-day basis, this is also a quality that you can teach her to harness so that she can use her powers for good. :) Since you have already made a point to bring her concerns to the administration, encourage **her** to bring them up to the admins. I've seen multiple situations in which the administration will blow off a teacher's concerns, but a persistent student can get results. Tell her that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Additionally, I wonder if the exchange program is okay with the fact that this student is being placed in classes several years below her level - doesn't seem like she's getting much educationally from the experience, and if she's supposed to be getting credits for her time it definitely doesn't make sense to have her in sophomore classes if she's a senior. Ask her if she's communicated with her exchange program about this problem, and encourage her to do so if she hasn't.

4. **Talk to her about what she has previously studied, find out what she's interested in, and come up with an extension plan together.** Your idea to give her more challenging work specifically is completely spot-on, you just have to assess her in order to plan accordingly. I've found that students who have her mindset often have no problem at all taking assessment/placement tests, so if it makes her skill levels clearer to you (or your admins) just ask her respectfully if she would be willing to take some assessments in the hopes that you can either design a more challenging curriculum for her, or she can use the data to convince the administration to move her to classes that are more challenging and suitable for her. Ask her about her plans for the future and what she likes to study - if she's particularly interested in some topic or subject, give her a giant college-level research project that she can work on during her class. Alternately, since she's a senior in Germany she may have college planning to do or applications/essays to write. You could allow her to work on these during your class for credit, so that she doesn't have to participate in a lesson about something she has already learned. Bonus: she'll be too busy to belittle her classmates and teachers. :)

5. **Refuse to permit her bullying. Be clear with the student about exactly *why* her comments in class are neither helpful nor appreciated, but frame it positively and without attacking the student as much as possible.** If she is belittling teachers or shaming students about their abilities in class, that is completely unacceptable and I hope you are making a point to shut that shit down immediately and publicly. As opposed to Germany, we do not have separate schools for special education/vocational ed/college prep students. This is something that is completely out of your (or your students') hands. If she is being a brat because she doesn't like the ""system"" make it very clear that she is welcome to take her concerns to the admins or her program supervisors, but they are not helpful, welcome, or effective when directed toward her teachers or peers. Additionally, the whole idea of participating in an exchange program is experiencing and learning from different cultures, whether or not you agree with how they do things. This is a situation where you can pull her aside for a sidebar the first time she pulls this act, but after 1 warning/sidebar you need to address it in class and follow any disciplinary procedures (write-up, call to host family) necessary. It's okay for her to be upset about her situation, it's not okay for her to be a jerk to other students and her teachers because she isn't enjoying her exchange program. This is non-negotiable, because even if she isn't learning academically she clearly needs additional socialization in how to deal with her frustrations in an acceptable manner.

6. **Encourage the student to ""tutor"" other students, aid her classmates, or act as a teaching assistant in exchange for extra credit or a written recommendation.** If she really is that far ahead and there's no way she's going anywhere, one way to counter the high-and-mighty attitude is to stroke her ego. Have her work with 1 or 2 students who could use some extra help, and base her class credit on this work. Ask her to be your TA and be responsible for attendance, grading, etc - because you know *she* can take care of it no problem. :) Make her a peer leader when you are doing peer editing/writing (she may require some coaching on how to provide feedback) so that some of the proofreading pressure is taken off you and she feels like she isn't wasting her time. All of this can be framed very positively, and you can present it in such a way that emphasizes her *leadership* and *generosity* in assisting her classmates. 

7. **Emphasize the extracurricular and social aspects of American high school.** She may be completely bored by the academic component of high school, but to be honest I know a lot of American students who would reply, ""welcome to the club."" However, there are lots of extracurricular and social opportunities offered by American high schools that may not be available in Germany (and if they are, they definitely take a different form). It's starting to warm up outside - is she interested in sports? Does your school have any extracurricular activities that align with her interests? (See #4) Ask her how she is enjoying living with her host family... Is it possible that some of her bad attitude is due to homesickness or friction with her hosts? If so, that's an even better reason she should be getting out and experiencing **everything** about American culture. This might help her loosen up in class, as well as help her enjoy her time here a bit more. If she's not a social person and is truly appalled by the American educational system, talk to her about starting a journal or blog about her experiences and opinions so that she has an outlet other than your class.

I hope these ideas help, I know how frustrating when a student has a bad attitude and ends up dragging down the class. It sounds like you've definitely taken steps to address the issue in class as well as her concerns, so just keep communicating and building that relationship. Luckily you've got a few months to work on her, and it sounds like showing her respect and treating her like an adult will get her on your side very quickly. Best of luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I have a blog about [DIY](http://handymandy5678.blogspot.com), and I just started a blog about [education](http://techladyd304.blogspot.com). 

I went to an inservice (that wasn't required by my school and was on my own time) about college readiness and mathematics at the community college. Most of the people there were high school teachers. The presenter mentioned that they had a position open for a remedial math teacher - all you needed were high school credentials and experience teaching math at the high school level. I went and talked to her after the presentation ended, submitted my resume, and emailed her. A couple weeks later she asked me to come in and fill out paperwork. There wasn't even an interview. I guess that's what they call networking. 

The same community college approached me to teach GED classes, but I figure 5 jobs would be a little over the top. Although I have done it before. 

Sometimes I work as a handywoman during the summer. Sometimes I teach summer school. Sometimes I go to Disney World. Depends on how much I need money that year, and how much I need to relax. 

Edit: I teach one 3 hour class once a week at night for the community college. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes.

I have 4 jobs. My main full time job is at a high school as a co-teacher for math and science.

I also teach as an adjunct instructor at my local community college. I teach remedial math, which is basically high school math.

I am president of a swing dance organization. I teach swing dancing and I DJ. 

I write a blog. I've been told this isn't a ""real job"" but I post fairly regularly and I get paid to do it. So. 

"
highschoolteachers,"Teaching history is awesome, and you absolutely will make a difference in their lives just by being enthusiastic, consistent, fair and firm.  Some of your kids will have never seen that in action and will eat it up; others will rebel against it.  The public speaking thing you'll get used to...teenagers can be intimidating (they're like dogs in packs...they smell fear).  Fake it til you make it.
A big thing to be careful of is this: when it comes to teaching high school, you are dealing with kids who are often teetering on the edge of control.  When they succeed, teachers are relegated to the background (even if you know better, be prepared for no one - including, often, the students themselves - to recognize you); when they fail, teachers take the blame.  Their successes are theirs, their failures are yours (or the school's).  Keep the long-term view...when they make bad decisions, YOU have not failed.  Most of them will, eventually, get there and grow up.  Some will not.  You cannot save the world - and this is a disappointing aspect of teaching, because so often you will see the potential, see the danger growing, and end up standing helplessly by while the train crashes.  

But when, after a year or two, students start coming back to you saying that they miss your class, or you run into them in the store and they're telling you about their triumphs in college, or you get facebook messages ten years later asking for reference letters or insight into something that's happening in the world or just to say 'thanks' - there's nothing like it on earth.  A lot of satisfaction from teaching is delayed, but it's worth waiting for!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English. I probably give homework 2-3 nights a week, but, it honestly just depends on what we're working on at any given time. A research paper unit means work on a large project over time, but a novel will probably have shorter, but more frequent assignments. However, I almost always give some time in class for working on assignments and rarely assign anything that's due the following day. 

My TA isn't especially useful at grading, but I do have her file graded work into folders for each student where they can retrieve their work so I don't have to hand it back. I typically use a check system where a check plus is 100%, a check is a 75%, and a check minus is anywhere from a 25% to a 50% depending on my mood. I check for completion, but read a few key areas. And randomly will grade kind of harshly with lots of comments to keep them on their toes. 

I find homework useful. I just don't have time to read an entire novel to them in class AND have assignments to deepen comprehension AND find time for them to draft and write essays. "
highschoolteachers,"I taught in a high school once where we were required to give grade-able homework four nights per week (I was teaching 5 different preps, all English, and reading didn't count as ""acceptable"" homework - it had to be something I could ""correct"", and not just a completion grade either).  It was a nightmare anyway, but when the principal suggested that it would be good to add at least one 2-3 page essay per class per week...well, that's why I'm in the past-tense when referring to my work there.  "
highschoolteachers,My smart board is on a track so I can move it out of the way. They installed in right in front of the only whiteboard in the classroom. My high school science classroom doesn't have a whiteboard unless I move the smart board out of the way...makes no sense.
highschoolteachers,"My second grade teacher was my initial inspiration.  Later, in high school, it was my history teacher.  I can't say I made a decision based on job security or salary.  I wasn't that meta about it when I went to college.  I became a teacher to help and guide.  

Sure, it's a benefit to have the summers off with my children.  Sure, the eventual job security I'll have is wonderful.  (although, with the changes in teacher evaluations, I'll argue that we're all never really secure.)



"
highschoolteachers,"Usually just her and myself. Although this week I found out her student intern from last semester will be spending one day a week with us. She treats her old student intern (female) polar opposite to me. She is laughs and smiles, hushed conversations in the corner...actually it feels like high school only with adults."
highschoolteachers,"Well shoot, all my ideas involved art.  I guess the best advice I have to offer would be that I've found that my high school students all get a kick out of doing nostalgic childhood-esque things, like coloring with crayons (there's lots of free printable complex designs, my students love Disney character ones though), board games, Uno etc.  On extended advisory schedule days I pull these out.  I also have a few card tricks under my belt that I will do for them and then teach how to do.

It might be hard for students to buy into these in a subbing situation though, particularly when it doesn't relate much to the class subject."
highschoolteachers,This is paranoid schizophrenia. Those of you who teach high school and college should learn to recognize the signs. Symptoms of schizophrenia can manifest as late as your mid twenties. I'm going to go out on a limb and say our author here is a male in his early twenties or late teens who has not yet been medicated or who refuses medication. It can be very difficult to get schizophrenics to medicate because their paranoid delusions tell them it is mind control or some other evil.
highschoolteachers,"Same here. I teach high school freshmen, which is where a lot of them are starting to see that there are actual consequences to failing a class. "
highschoolteachers,"Worked in management consulting for the government, now in school to be a high school teacher. I'm 25. I feel like my working experience really benefited me and will continue to benefit me as I look for jobs. It's also fun to tell students personal stories about government, history, etc."
highschoolteachers,"Degrees in Computer Engineering and Law.  Started subbing at age 27, a year after graduating from law school. Started teaching IT: Networking the following Fall.  Now I teach a variety of technology classes in a high school as well as coach the Mock Trial team."
highschoolteachers,"Find a well off high school that issues laptops, ipads (etc) to all their students.
Compare with traditional non tech schools.

Make sure you like your topic, you will have it in your academic background for the rest of your life.      
Master's Thesis do not go away.  "
highschoolteachers,"Exactly! I'm in Thailand right now, but I've had similar experiences in Korea and Taiwan. I was actually told my my admin last year at a boarding high school (they only saw their families once every month or two) that it would be nice if I had my students come to my apartment in groups of 5-6 once a semester for ""Culture night."" At first I was hesitant, but it was really a fantastic thing for everyone involved. They got a chance to take some time out from studying to play board games, speak English, and eat American food. Of course, if I even thought about doing that in the US, I'd likely be fired immediately. "
highschoolteachers,"So this happened at the school I teach. There's a girl with alopecia at my school and so wears a wig. During dismissal while waiting for busses one student started filming her while another came from behind, grabbed the wig and threw it onto the pavement. It went viral on Vine pretty quickly (About two days later it showed up on my Facebook feed from someone totally unrelated to my high school).

The student ended up missing plenty of school. Administration came down on the student pretty hard - some major suspensions were issued. It turned into a pretty big deal. None of them were my students, but I know that teachers were quite supportive. Students reacted quite well too. Overall, be there for your students. Work with your administration when you find out about something. Be that teacher."
highschoolteachers,"Oklahoma is in the first year of a new law (Reading Sufficiency Act) that will not allow students to move to 4th grade if they don't pass the 3rd grade reading test. Of course it is being hotly debated right now.

Before that there was no policy. AFAIK a kid could be socially promoted until high school, where we actually start making them earn credits."
highschoolteachers,It stops in high school when kids need credits to graduate. It kinda pulls the rug out from underneath them. Kids aren't prepared to perform. 
highschoolteachers,"I am currently in my third year teaching in the Hillsborough County School district (Tampa Area). I would say that I enjoy it here. I have gotten the feeling that this district truly cares about its teachers and they do everything in their power to assist them.

The county is also very diverse with many different populations. I am currently teaching at a high school with a high latino population and I would say it is one of the best schools I have taught at. While the children may be a challenge at first, it has been a great experience and I really feel like I am making a difference in some of their lives."
highschoolteachers,"Texas here. We stop in high school. Mostly because in 8th grade, if you pass everything but math, they don't want you having to retake all the classes you passed. In high school, if you pass everything but algebra, you can take algebra again, and move on in other subjects. 

You have to be doing poorly in 2 or 3 core subjects for us to consider holding you back before that. There's a lot more to it than just keeping kids of the same age together. ""Social promotion"" is really a misnomer."
highschoolteachers,thank you!  What school district were you apart of in high school?
highschoolteachers,"I did my senior year of high school in Florida. IT WAS AWFUL!!!! Overcrowded, violent, understaffed. The education was terrible. We were doing stuff I'd done in middle school at my previous school. University in florida, however, was great. I'd say research the district, see the school, meet your fellow teachers, and decide based on that. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I don't believe there's a fixed rule of when to stop socially promoting since it's not an official policy in my state (or probably any state really, because--think of the backlash).  On the other hand, I'm pretty sure we start doing it right before they'd be required to take the high school graduation test that they'd certainly fail, which would hurt our ""numbers."""
highschoolteachers,"The classes move pretty quick at college level- at least they did for me! Spanish 1 in college covered about three years of high school Spanish :o) Did you ever take Spanish in high school? If you did, it will help out a ton!

I don't know what your college is like, but here we have free tutoring, so look into that. Language classes can be intimidating, but they are rewarding too! 

You can try practicing online with native speakers (there are lots of websites for that) if you want to get your feet wet. If you'd like to know some more resources, just PM me!

"
highschoolteachers,"Having been married to a teacher, this is about right (except for the 4 weeks prepping classrooms.)  Of course, it probably depends on what and where you teach.  If you teach kindergarten your schedule is probably different from middle school and those different from high school. 
Of course consider that many of us who aren't teachers also work stupid long hours. Eight hour days plus business trips, after hours teleconferences, time checking work e - mail at home.  Of course, I don't think my job impacts society as much as my wife's, no matter how many hours I work."
highschoolteachers,"I'm 24. I frequently question who decided it was a good idea to allow me to teach high school. This is my 2nd year teaching. My oldest student this year is 5 years younger than I am. Maybe it's because I teach high school, but I really still feel like I'm playing the part of an adult- like I'm not actually an adult but I can pretend well enough to fool other people!

Also, I'm young enough that some of my students have siblings that are older than me. I found this out the hard way when a guy that was 2 years older than me asked me out, and I found out later that he was the older sibling of one of my current students."
highschoolteachers,"The high school I went to had two students that made a fake myspace page about one of the vice principals. It was...not nice to say the least. 

She sued their parents for emotional damages and totally skipped over the school system. She even went on Dr. Phil expecting sympathy and was basically scolded by him (only time I've actively been a fan). 

I've thought for a long time if she was right or wrong to avoid the school discipline system. I think she just wanted some free money and revenge, not to teach the boys a lesson. That's my biggest worry with disciplining students for out of school behavior: if it is to correct the behavior or to make a faculty member feel better. "
highschoolteachers,"I just embrace it. I know that my students respect me and my knowledge enough that they are learning from me, even if they make jokes about how short I am while they are doing it. Their parents are usually surprised when they meet me (since I teach high school), but I'm good in my subject area and very professional, so that shock seems to fade after the initial meeting. All in all, since I take my job seriously and work hard, having a baby face hasn't seemed to have any negative effects."
highschoolteachers,"27 here, four months into my first teaching job (flew out the day after I finished training to start teaching the very next monday). I had been in university in NZ since I finished high school and now I'm in Sudan teaching history. It's been a very strange three and a half months... 

Having my own place and income is what's making me feel grown up. The students seem so young that being in charge of them doesn't seem like a big deal - even though they are high schoolers and I teach mainly the older ones. I think somewhere along the way I added another category after 'Child' and 'Teenager', but before 'Adult'."
highschoolteachers,"I find this weird now, I attend a high school in which we are encouraged to call our teachers by their first name. I actually prefer it. "
highschoolteachers,"This is happening to me less and less, but some of the younger kids at my new school knew me first from the math tutoring center where I originally worked, so they know me by my first name. 

And I work at my old high school, so some of them just recognize me from when I was a student.

The other trouble is that when they do call me by my last name, I don't immediately respond to it yet. Working on it!"
highschoolteachers,"For me it started in junior high when I narcissistically thought I could do a better job than my current teachers.  I loved class with two of my high school teachers.  My feeling toward being an educator eventually evolved into it being the only career I could realistically see for myself.  I really enjoy hanging out with kids all day (4th grade).  I work in a building where everyone is positive and is working each day to do what is best for kids.  I met my wife at work.  Education is my life and I have a hard time picturing myself doing anything else and being satisfied.  


You will always hear the cliche from teachers that is basically ""I can't believe what/how I was teaching my first year""...that's cliche because it is absolutely true.  Even the most prepared first year teachers do not know what they are doing.  Teacher Ed programs can give you all the pedagogy but nothing replaces true experience.  "
highschoolteachers,"If you want to create an incentive based system for behavior like work ethic, go nuts, but please don't attach an academic grade to things like that. 

Here's the problem: If your students should objectively be failing, then ***give them failing grades***. By giving them D's or C's and passing them along so you feel better about yourself, they're going to end up in high school with a transcript that says they've been passing all of their classes, and yet they can't see to read or multiply. 

I completely understand the predicament, and I wholeheartedly support motivational tools like those you're referring to, but a grade is supposed to represent how much the course content was mastered by the student. Grade inflation is a real problem in this country and it doesn't do anybody any favors. 

SBG is a incredible grading philosophy and will it actually helps improve teaching practices as well. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about it. "
highschoolteachers,"And THAT is why I teach middle school! Street Cred. 
When you say you teach high school, you get stories about a favorite/influential teacher. 
When you say you teach elementary people make a coo-ing noise. When you say you teach middle school, they look at you like you're a combat medic. 

On that scale of 1 to alligator wrestling... well that seems to assume that alligator wrestling isn't also a ton of fun!"
highschoolteachers,"We go in a tad later than the high school. 

There seem to be a lot more middle school availabilities than high school. I figure many do what I plan to do once I reach tenure--ask for a transfer to the high school. 

All that aside, I've been teaching LAL middle school for 5 years (with a few 9-12 grade classes. First three years was a 6-12 grade school). What I find most exciting about it is developing the deep thinking skills they'll be expected to use in high school. High school has better literature, but middle school sets up the blocks for them so to speak. 

What's also really exciting is when students come to visit from high school and say, ""Oh my God! Everything you taught us we do in high school!"" To hear from students that the skills you taught are useful and relevant is very rewarding. "
highschoolteachers,"Moderate. Fiscally conservative, socially liberal. I teach high school and make every attempt to be straight-faced when my super duper rural kids make utterly racist and bigoted remarks. "
highschoolteachers,"Where are you looking for your cert? CT was(is?) basically broken into k-6, middle school, high school. (Some overlaps and some differences depending on exact specialty.)

Right now I'm a technology teacher seeing k-4 students. I'd go running into the night if I had K all the time, too needy. 1 and 2 aren't horrible but the content is boring. 3 and 4 aren't bad, beginning to bring in some more thinking and not necessarily the bad behaviors of older kids.

Long term I'm probably going to look into getting HS certified for a change.

....and not exactly helpful but to answer your question: Undergrad was computers based, didn't get into education until years later. Did a year+ for the education degree.
"
highschoolteachers,"Are there alternative school options? Maybe a move to a self-contained class (behavioral/LD) if you have them? 

I work in self contained as an aide and we have 20 of these kids (high school aged) but the teacher and I can curb this quickly. It's not fair for one kid to be so disruptive to you and the class a a whole. Seems this boy needs specialized instruction. Good luck. It's tough when one disrupts all and exhausts your efforts. How are his grades? "
highschoolteachers,"Not a kindergarten teacher but I went through an education program in my undergrad. My program did have gen eds (just like every other college program) but my last 2 years were mainly education classes. However, if you take an alternative certification program, you'll probably just take education classes. Definitely observe kindergarten/primary before you make the plunge. I went into education thinking I'd be a high school English teacher but now I'm in elementary. 

I can't really help with what goes into kindergarten because I've only did a week or so as a TA there but it was a lot of routine building/teaching sounds and sight words/teaching kids how to be in school. The payment depends on where you work/live and you can easily find that online."
highschoolteachers,"When I went into my education program, I was pretty much set that I wanted to teach high school science.  But through all my field experiences, my time with 6th and 7th graders was about the most fun.  What I found was that 7th graders were way more willing to jump in with two feet than, say, 9th graders while at the same time being much more likely to actively ""socialize"" with teachers than sophomores and juniors.  Seniors are a breed apart and can go either way, being the worst students because they're almost ""done"" or the best because they're the big-men-on-campus and they don't need to impress anyone by being ""cool"" anymore.

Basically, my experiences in the classroom changed my mind to the point where I'd choose a middle school position over a high school position just for the excitement the students bring."
highschoolteachers,"I teach full-time at a private high school.  My class sizes range from 4 students in my smallest class, to 16 in my biggest; on average, my classes tend to range from 8-12 students. I am not in the USA, so I don't know if that makes a difference but there are some differences - in my experience - between private and public.  I find in private school the parents are more involved - after all, they are paying out of pocket.  Make sure you have reasoning behind your grades, and justification for your assignments (that they tie with curriculum well, etc.). As for the students - while I still have a range of ability in my class, even the lower students have higher expectations than on average (at least from my experience).  As a result, I (and my employers) often have higher expectations with what I teach - again, goes with the whole people are directly paying for this logic.  I have significantly fewer behaviour problems; I haven't sent a student out of my class or to the principal all year. It really depends on the atmosphere of the school though.  Good luck! "
highschoolteachers,"You're hearing about the extreme cases.  I teach high school and most days it's fine.  Why did I want to teach high school?  I can interact with my students on a much higher intellectual level than I could at elementary or middle school, and it's much less physically exhausting.  

Personally, I'd never want to teach elementary school.  Different strokes for different folks."
highschoolteachers,"I grew up wanting to teach and coach. Coaching is definitely easier if you are a teacher and I think coaching helps in the classroom (especially if you coach a big sport in that school or area). 

I teach math right now, but have taught Social studies and language arts all at the middle school.

I coach basketball at the middle school and this year I started helping at the high school. Next year I plan to just do high school.

I gave up a lot of time to coaching during the winter months. I practiced an hour and a half each day at the middle school. On days of early practices I then went to the high school for another 2 hours of practice. There were some nights where nearly 5 hours were dedicated between the two teams.

I love coaching, I figured if I got into coaching it would be for baseball or golf, but am loving coaching basketball. Coaching helps me build relationships with students, especially some of your more difficult students. I teach 6th grade, before they're able to try out for basketball. EVERY 6th grade boy thinks they can ball, so they are extra good in my class thinking that I will keep them on the team based solely on my class.

Teaching has been everything I thought and much more. I never saw myself teaching in the environment that I am in, but I think it has made me a better person. I grew up very affluent to where if I ever needed anything I had it. I now teach in a different state, in a different region of the US. Have a large percentage of poor minority students. Some of these students have seen more in their young lives than I have in 25 years.

I only have one issue with coaching and that is that other teachers think I am their solution to classroom management. I don't know how many emails I got this year about X and Y not focusing on class work or playing on their chromebook. Yes they will run for this at practice but this is simple stuff that I don't need you wasting my time with. 

If you are only getting into teaching to coach I would advise against it. If you want to teach and coach then go for it, but be ready to give up a ton of time and energy. I would recommend not doing anything your first year or two. My first year I helped at the middle school. I had a terrible class load and it was one of the few things that kept me sane. Without it I don't know if I would have stayed at my school. Although I helped I didn't have to give up more than about an hour each day.

highschoolteachers,"Out of my Mind by Sharon Draper, The Lions of Little Rock by Kristin Levine, Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli. These recommendations come with a caveat that I'm a high school librarian who has never worked with fifth graders before! So I'm sharing books I consider appropriate for 7th-9th grade. Do you have a school librarian? See if she could offer something to you as well.  "
highschoolteachers,"I am not sure what grade level you are preparing for, but I got a lot out of Harry Wong's *The First Days of School,* even though it is obviously written with elementary school teachers in mind (I teach high school). You can get it for three or four bucks, used, online.

What would I recommend personally though? 

1. Have a system for dealing with absent work that works for you and that you can stick with all year. In a nutshell, mine includes a big calendar on a huge cork board. Kids go there to see what they missed. All handouts are in file folders on the board; I date them by putting a post-it on the outside of the folder. There is a 2nd calendar for them to pencil in their name if they need to make up a test/quiz after school.

2. Have a system for dealing with late work. I give them two chances, and then their work gets a zero. I put a check mark by their name on the same clipboard where I tally their tardies and restroom/drink/locker passes.

3. Be firm but fair. Expect good behavior and respect, and when that's not happening, follow through with your management plan. My plan goes like this: proximity, verbal prompting, verbal warning, time out in the hall for five minutes, discussion in the hall, trip to the counselor, trip to the dean (+referral). I will skip steps if necessary.

4. Have high expectations, but make sure they are realistic, too. Pre-assessments help me figure out where to set my expectations. My goal is to challenge everyone, and that might mean different things for different kids. Expect effort and growth, and if you aren't seeing it, touch base with the student individually. If they do poorly on something, I write notes on the work encouraging them and offering suggestions about how to do better next time. If they are really slipping, I chat with them after class. It helps to have a notecard to write action items on (things they can re-do/correct; upcoming tests/quizzes/assignments).

Basically, be super organized and have high expectations.

Finally, grading sucks.

1) You don't have to grade everything! Give completion points, check work in class together, do practice assignments that they check themselves and don't even turn in.

2) You don't have to feel bad about grading during class time. Give them something to do, and make it clear that they can come up to your desk if they need help."
highschoolteachers,"This is a bad idea. I remember my English teacher did something like this when I was in high school. We had to stand in the corner, all packed together and silent for ten full minutes, to simulate being in a cattle car. Honestly as a Jewish person I find it really insulting. Nothing you do in that classroom is going to be even close to what struggles the refugees actually faced. What's the point? To say ""this classroom obstacle course is somewhat similar to fleeing the Holocaust!"" is offensive."
highschoolteachers,in what universe are high school math classes 4 hours long.
highschoolteachers,"No. This is not usual. My high school has lost a kid every year, for 4 years in a row ( and one year, there were 2). Last year, when a student died, I first found out from a student over the weekend and then the admin emailed us. On Monday, another email was sent to notify us how to tell the kids, and where the grief counselors were located in the school, and how to send students to them. Topics for general discussion on grief were given, or the option to do something low key. After lunch, counsellors were made available to teachers (I certainly needed it and she wasn't even my student. Just my students best friend, and that was very overwhelming). A few days later, the funeral was announced and we were directed to mark kids absent anyway and tell them the absence was unexcused. 90% of the kids went anyway. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm in my eighth year of teaching (I've taught both middle and high school).  I do think you've made some mistakes here.

First, the ""students' rights"" lesson is probably a questionable idea for middle school students.  At that young age, they probably do not have the kind of intellectual/emotional maturity to responsibly grasp that concept.  (Remember that the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for foresight, does not mature until a person is in his/her TWENTIES.  Middle schoolers are light years from that point.)  I'm frankly not surprised that they misunderstood your intent and staged a ""protest.""  The nature of a (pre-)teen is to view the world as one of perpetual injustice.  Everything is ""unfair"" from their perspective.  

Second, maybe I'm misreading you but it does sound like you're internalizing your students' complaints about these other teachers - like you accept their complaints at face value.  You may not realize  this, but the teachers that the kids all bitch about are often very GOOD at their jobs, especially when it comes to classroom management, which is why the students complain after the fact - they're afraid to act out in class.  

Never forget that there's a reason why all your colleagues have survived as long as they have in this profession.  If you've never actually seen them teach, why should you doubt their ability?  Because a 13-year-old said they weren't good?

Third, you should NEVER tell another teacher that the kids don't like him/her.  That is rude, no matter how you phrase it.  No one wants to hear that other people don't like them.  And yes, it gives off the impression that you are siding with the students.  Don't ever say something like that.  

I can imagine why you've been allowing your students to vent about other teachers.  You're in your first year, and perhaps struggling a bit with your self-confidence.  When you hear your kids complain about their other teachers, on some level it makes you feel better about yourself, because 1) at least it's not about you; 2) it suggests that you might not be the only struggling teacher and 3) it perhaps makes you think the kids are letting you into their confidence.  

But this is wrong, and it's not the way to earn respect for yourself from your students and colleagues.  You should defend your colleagues if your kids start complaining: ""This isn't a place for negativity"" or something like that. 

Now, if a student just won't stop complaining about a teacher, do this:

Go to said teacher, and ask him/her ""Do you have [name] in your class?  After he/she says yes, ask ""How is [name] doing?"" You'll get the other side of the story without ever causing offense to the other teacher, and in fact, you'll find that in the vast majority of the cases, the student is full of crap and the teacher has a point.

highschoolteachers,It's pretty difficult as a high school math teacher to find content-relevant videos. I have a four hour long class tomorrow and I still haven't figured out what we're going to do after they're done with their normal things. 
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I have to teach double-clicking and right-clicking.

I teach CAD in high school and on a daily basis I have to explain the difference between right clicking, double clicking, dragging and hovering. Probably 2/3 of the problems my pupils face when using the software is down to this and they just immediately give up as soon as it doesn't work. I won't help them unless they show me that they've tried at least a couple of different ways to solve their problem."
highschoolteachers,"I am a high school math teacher in Michigan, but that would be true just about anywhere. My contract doesn't include summers and I refuse to do anything that's not required of me for fear of it setting a president in my school. That being said, I will do something if a student asks and I believe it will directly benefit them."
highschoolteachers,"Oh my god, yes.

* ""I evidently got to high school without the ability to read directions""
* ""I didn't listen when you were explaining directions.""

I don't understand."
highschoolteachers,"Yeah, I did that for him as well. It's sad these mistakes happen as late as high school and college. "
highschoolteachers,"I did my student teaching in a classroom of freshman with heavily integrated technology last fall.  Next fall the whole high school will be one to one and the teachers, especially the younger ones, have been telling admin to expect a lot of issues because, to older folks (in this context, even as young as mid 30s us old), these students are ""tech native"".  These students grew up in the computer era.  But my freshmen were just, pure and simple, well below where my generation was in terms of computer usage.  I was born in 1985, so I came of age in the era of instant messaging, chat rooms, and PC computer games...I'm ""tech native"", basically.  My students are coming of age in the era of texting, social media, and mobile or console gaming.  They can use these tools fine but they missed the intermediate step I learned of having to navigate a computer interface to get to my AOL instant messenger, etc.  And that extra step is where I learned the ""language"" of Windows and Mac based computers, the commands, shortcuts, and such that are constant across programs.  I'm not talking programming, I'm talking very simple things like copy/paste, CTRL+C.

It's not a problem with the students, they're just growing up in their world.  The problem is with their early education.  When I was in elementary school, I had regular typing classes in the library once or twice a week starting in about 3rd grade.  By 7th grade, I had to be able to type 60 words per minute without being able to see my hands.  This was nothing special...everyone in my district could do it.  Many of my freshmen last fall had technology courses with a fellow student teacher and she'd regularly complain that they couldn't cover the material their curriculum called for because the first month and a half was just learning to type on something that wasn't a three and a half inch touchscreen.

Basically, I'm saying we need to accept that our students are no longer ""tech native"" when it comes to PCs and start teaching the classes I had 20 years ago or our students are going to really suffer when they get somewhere where not everything can be due by phone."
highschoolteachers,I do PowerPoint with 1st graders and excel with 2nd. Teaching typing/mouse skills is not a focused skill but instead a regularly incorporated skill in all lessons. I do online research with 3-5. You don't have to wait to middle/high school.
highschoolteachers,"Well if you have a masters you can teach at the community college level without any ed coursework, i believe. If this person wants to teach high school then there are regular or alternative cert. programs. Read up on http://tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Certification/"
highschoolteachers,"I once had a high school student type two spaces between every word of an essay. When I noticed and asked what the heck he was doing, he said, ""The directions said double space."" I almost died."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I guess you're never too old for stickers.

In my senior year of high school, my history teacher gave us a sticker for every time we participated. You would've thought she was giving out gold. (I had a notebook covered with them by the time the school year came to a close.)"
highschoolteachers,The iron fist is the hardest thing to learn. I'm teaching 5th and 6th graders for the first time (I used to be a high school teacher) and I've had to relearn my classroom management. You can't be a nice teacher/cool teacher unless you've set high standards for your classroom; kids really respect/need those boundaries.
highschoolteachers,"At the high school level, it can reflect the total across all classes. "
highschoolteachers,"Does this work at the high school level? It seems crazy to give my students an average of an hour and a half to two hours of homework, especially if their other classes do that as well. "
highschoolteachers,"No, they are there to learn. There are better and different ways to learn than just sitting there taking notes. Especially because research shows that doesn't really work all that well, and if it did, the USA wouldn't be so far behind in education. 
My high school only had 40 minute classes and would never have done hours of notes without a break. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science with 100 minute periods and I have the exact same issue. A good portion of my seniors aren't on track to graduate so they definitely aren't going to college, so many of the ""you'll have to do this in college"" talks I have with them have no effect. I've also tried talking to them about things from the perspective of a job (""you can't just ignore your boss when he or she tells you do something!"") but that has no effect either. 

Half of the time, I wonder if I can keep their attention for 5 minutes when giving notes."
highschoolteachers,"I'm just saying, I remember when I was in high school, notes and work sheets were the worst. The labs were fun and I'm sure yours are great. But an hour on notes? No one has the attention span for that. Give them a break. Be more lenient, let them have a few minutes to get up, stretch, walk, etc. Studies show that for every 20 minutes sitting, you should get a 2 minute break. 

I wasn't trying to offend you. I get that they must be safe,but based off what you said, you might need to change up the approach and try something else. "
highschoolteachers,"I've noticed the difference in anxiety levels in students even from when I graduated from high school in 2009.

I was pretty much the only person that had a really bad anxiety disorder in my class. Now, as a teacher, I have at least a few in every class. I take my kids on lots of little walks around the academic area. (We have a blended learning style academics at the career center I work at. Lots of the work is self paced and online)"
highschoolteachers,"One thing my department chair advised me to do is making announcements about how they should be breaking up their time. For example if they have 15 minutes to answer 5 questions; you say ""you have 3 minutes to answer #1"" then 3 minutes late, ""you should finish up your answer to question 1 and begin question 2; you have 3 minutes to work on question 2"". I've tried this with various assignments, especially paragraph writing with my students (high school) and it seems to motivate students to work who are having trouble staying on track, getting distracted, etc."
highschoolteachers,"LOL this is kind of adorable but also makes me happy I don't teach high school. At least you'd be giving your teacher warning that you'd spend their entire class talking to crush?

TL:DR- Don't do it."
highschoolteachers,"Depending on your school policy, I find letting my kids listen to their music while they work helpful. I didn't allow it until this year (as our school policy has also lightened on music during ""instructional"" time) but it really does seem to work with my high schoolers. I put a time up on the board that the headphones need to come out. "
highschoolteachers,"Sounds like the junior high school in your area gives too much homework. 

Imposing homework on young children so they'll be more likely to accept a heavier workload later is a ridiculous idea. 

How do you respond to parents who don't support your homework practices? I think the time is coming when educated parents will simply refuse to allow it."
highschoolteachers,"Last year I had a two month gap in pay between my teaching contracts - long story. So I thought about a part time retail job. Wasn't thrilled about the idea so a friend told me about how she makes bank tutoring. I can do that! And I also use to teach music lessons in high school so why not start that up again? I live in an area where parents will pay me $40/hour for piano lessons and $50+/hour for math tutoring. Yes, parents want their kid tutored during the summer. I made great money by never having to leave my neighborhood and I more than made up for the two month gap in pay. I kept a few clients on during the school year and make $120 during the week for fun money. "
highschoolteachers,"Thank you! I can't say for sure it's exactly what will fit me because I come from such a different background, but I'm reading a good book right now and in it the author says not to worry about finding your passion, because you will become passionate about what you become good at, and that makes a lot of sense. That's exactly what happened with math for me. I never took algebra in high school. So in order to prepare for getting starting at my community college, I began teaching myself, and I fell in complete love with it. When I entered school I worked hard and excelled in all my math classes. I'm now in Calculus 2, and I can totally relate to the idea of becoming passionate at what you become good at. 

Same thing happened with tutoring. At first I was terrible, but I have worked at it and now I really enjoy it and I get requests from students to work with me. I've had several college kids tell me I should be a teacher and that's what set me off on this new path.

If I can get good at the art of teaching and classroom management then I have a good shot and my passion will follow I believe."
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching 5 years.  What is becoming more and more evident is that students are now more afraid of having the wrong answer.  So much so that most won't even venture to attempt to answer a question.  I have students every day waiting for me to tell them the answer to questions.  They won't even answer opinion questions because they don't want to be wrong.

This is really my biggest frustration with my students.  In my district it's because the primary schools and middle schools don't challenge our students to think.  They don't challenge them because we have social promotion.  Even if they fail every class and can't read or write they will make it to high school.  So the county has bassically told primary teachers to tell students the information and when they get to high school those teachers will teach them how to critically think.

"
highschoolteachers,For the first time ever my pace has aligned perfectly and I will read *The Butter Battle Book* to my high school juniors to introduce the Cold War on this day.
highschoolteachers,"Almost every type of youth sport needs officials. If you are a sports person - learn the rules and work as an official. 

Most youth soccer leagues around me start at 18-28/game depending on age level and u17/18 games are between 30 and 75 a game depending on if you are a center referee or an assistant.  They're great for weekends

Most high school games start between 4-7pm and as long as you avoid your district or conference you should be good. 

Only drawback for soccer is it requires a relatively high level of fitness and knowledge of the game to be competent at. I hear volleyball is in high demand as it is growing more popular. That doesn't seem so physically demanding for officials to me. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm in high school, but I think this will cross over. It's relatively simple too. Have the kids draw a picture. Have them draw 21 tennis balls in groups of three. Each group of three is a can. Then you have 7 cans.

You could extend it to having 28 apples in buckets. Each bucket has 7 apples. How many buckets are there?

Having a picture or other representation of a problem can help your students make sense of the problem/what it is asking."
highschoolteachers,Go to your state's department of education website. Most places you can get in a credential program at a university. Takes one to two years. Talk to teachers in your state. Some states have a huge teacher shortage. Others have a surplus. With a comm degree your best bet may be middle or high school English. 
highschoolteachers,"I have been really trying to focus on the positive lately and have gotten a gym membership like suggested here. Today I got 2 emails from former students thanking me for helping to prepare them from high school. I think I may be on the path towards gaining a balance, but I'm still looking into therapy."
highschoolteachers,"Homework is a waste of a child's time (and their family's) until 7th or 8th grade. (This is when students in our area begin to study a second language and extra out of school work is necessary to memorize vocabulary.)

Much of the homework assigned in middle and high school (particularly for AP classes) is unnecessary."
highschoolteachers,"As a parent and teacher, there are things, you can do.  My middle son was very bright but not motivated, because school was too easy, and at the same time he was a disaster at staying on top of his school work once he hit middle school.  We worked on organization. One thing that really helped was a folder in the front of his binder for any homework. One side for completed work to turn in and the other for work to do. I checked it each night for two months, until he had the habit.  We also took away every outside activity until his grades improved. Then added back activities one at a time until he found out what he could handle.  Longest 6 months of his life, but made high school a breeze and college too.  I had to actively parent and keep him busy. Once his school work was done he was working at every chore I could fine.  He didn't have the electronics at that time, but today they would be the first distraction to go.  Be supportative, be willing to sit with him as he works to keep him going. Be strong and follow through.  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach some CAD and a whole plethora of tech ed, only we have to call it STEM in NYC because god forbid we stoop to the level of calling it what is actually is, and I def feel the skill ceiling. The kids can use CAD (sometimes) but then today it took some of them 30 minutes to log-on to google drive...I also would love to stretch, high school might be in my future, who knows."
highschoolteachers,"Wow OP, this is exactly what I deal with, only I think my episodes are more frequent than yours. When these cycles happen your pee is completely colorless right? It's like you are peeing pure water? It sucks and it's got me worried about how I'm going to manage being a teacher and dealing with this. 

A question for teachers. If I'm teaching high school isn't there like a ten minute interval between periods where I can go if I have to?"
highschoolteachers,"My comment was directed at OP, because s/he said they were questioning being a teacher because they remembered not always thinking the nicest things about teachers when they were in high school. :)"
highschoolteachers,"I don't think that being a goody two shoes is a detriment; you just have to adjust your expectations on behavior.  Transitioning from being a military officer to teaching has been a trip.  As an officer I got used to people doing what I asked them to.  It was just the norm.  I noticed that high school freshmen are just old enough to think abstractly about the world around them but some are still stuck in middle school in terms of maturity and attention span, so it's really been an adjustment for me.  But maturity and respect is a learned set of behaviors, so that strict, consistent and fair rule structure and relentless enforcement is key.  

When I call a kid out, it's never personal and my further interactions with them are always positive, meaning that when they show a ""good"" behavior, I ALWAYS respond positively and do something like acknowledge the behavior and thank them in front of their peers.   When you make it clear that things aren't personal and you're correcting the behavior and not making it a struggle of egos, there's no love lost.  Really, some of my biggest trouble makers and talkers end up being my favorite students.  They're cool kids and sometimes it's hard to sit in a desk for eight hours a day so they just act up.  That doesn't mean I let things slip; it's just that I get where they're coming from."
highschoolteachers,"As others have said, sounds like standards based assessment practices being implemented. The focus is on mastery of learner outcomes, gradual improvement, and grades not being viewed/perceived as punitive. 

My district has been using this at some schools for some time. All of the middle schools I've been in since I started 5 years ago use it. It does create some extra work on my end, and I think it's far too lenient (high school teachers have bemoaned the fact that the kids have zero respect for deadlines, and their parents also seem bewildered by the fact that they seem to come out of nowhere), but I've worked some ways around it. 

Our system has a grade of 'Insufficient Evidence' which counts as a zero. It's hard to give, but when a kid refuses to do a project/assignment, you've contacted home, tried to keep the kid on for extra help and time etc. And you've documented everything you've done to try and get it handed in and nothing, then you're completely justified in giving that mark. I've also given it for kids caught cheating, or any other circumstance where there isn't enough evidence to be able to give them a grade. The rest of our grades go up in 10% increments (Limited: 50% or below, Beginning: 50-60, Emerging: 60-70, Progressing: 70-80, Advancing: 80-90, Mastering: 90-100%) so any failing grade all gets lumped together with little distinction. 

If a kid scores Beginning or Limited, I email home, and give them 1 week to make corrections or use the feedback to improve their work.  I do not provide retests or makeup assignments, they must fix the original. That is a deadline I can enforce, although I have to accept any late assignments during the term it was assigned. I'm pretty flexible, especially if the kid missed due to illness etc. And I don't penalize kids who don't finish in class, need more time, and want to take something home to finish. Once I'm finalizing grades for report cards, I email home again to all parents of kids who are missing work, and say that any work not turned in will be given Insufficient Evidence and that will likely bring them down to a failing grade or very close to it. It makes finalizing grades a bitch and a half, but there's not much I can do there. I have to finalize grades, and if they've not turned it in for weeks or months, I feel just fine giving them IE and letting it drag their average down. "
highschoolteachers,"I feel like you are suggesting that I want the kids to like me in the way I might want my peers to like me, and that's absolutely not the case. I definitely don't question who I am or whether I am a good and likable person just because a kid (or five) hates me. I don't need or want them to be my buddies. But it doesn't feel good when they hate your guts. That's all I'm saying. It can be draining.

I also find that my high school students frequently come to me with problems, heartaches, and even with their joys and successes, and these types of chats take a lot out of me. It's not just the classroom time where I feel like I have to be ""on.""

Edit to add: I also feel like the perfectionism bit is actually even more important. In this job, there are so many balls in the air at once, and for me, it's impossible to feel that I'm doing everything the exact perfect way that I demand of myself. This is a constant nagging in the back of my mind. Then, when you add disgruntled parents in, as a perfectionist, it's hard for me to look at the situation and say to myself, ""Look, you've done nothing wrong. You're doing your best. Your best is good enough, great, even,"" because I don't believe that my best is good enough. I always see something I could have done better, something I could be doing better."
highschoolteachers,"Also as an additional note, I have students in high school who I have to sign planners/behavioral checklists for daily or weekly otherwise they still will not do it. One girl I currently do this for is in 11th grade! There are also parents who I am in contact with via email regularly about keeping up with assignments, staying after for tutoring, how often they're asleep or on their phones in class, etc. "
highschoolteachers,"Some people confuse engaging for ""fun"" and are wary of making school ""fun"" everyday. The real world isn't ""fun""-- work isn't ""fun,"" so students need to be able to develop the ability to do work that may not be very personally enriching.

Of course, there is a difference between fun and engaging, but mixing the two can make teachers wary of changing up their game because they don't want to be babying their students, especially high schoolers who are entering the world.

As /u/drakeonaplane said, it helps with classroom management. Some teachers are strict enough that they don't feel a pressure to introduce something for classroom management reasons. It's easier to do the lessons they've been doing for years, even if they aren't very engaging, if you can still keep tight control of the classroom with other tools.

Explaining the difference between engaging and fun could motivate the first group, and convincing the second group that engaging lessons actually help students retain information might convince them.

And of course sometimes they THINK it's engaging (or it IS engaging for some students), but some of the students are just getting lost in the shuffle."
highschoolteachers,"It is absolutely the teacher's job to train all students to function in society. Having an IEP does not stop that. It's supposed to promote that. Lol, Jesus Christ. You think the kid is going to be treated outside of high school the way you want me to treat them? They will leave high school and have no idea how to survive because no one is protecting them from responsibility. That is horribly cruel."
highschoolteachers,"I am in year 3 teaching high school English and this is the first year I finally feel like I'm getting a hang of keeping up with the grading (and I'm still behind....). Give yourself a break. It takes awhile to get a system that is manageable for you. 

If you're giving a grammar lesson and don't grade the assignment, just collect it and stack it somewhere. I do this frequently and I rarely have a kid ask me if I'll put it in the gradebook. When I do, I tell them that I decided not to grade it and they learned from the process. You don't have to grade everything and you can tell both kids and parents that. 

For essays, use a good rubric and don't put any comments on it at all. If kids want more feedback, they can set up a time to meet with you and talk about their essay. It's a more valuable process anyway and it puts the onus on them to try to learn how to improve.

I don't know how many preps you have, but I'll also sometimes prioritize just getting caught up on one class for a week and then I'll switch. For some reason, it's a little less overwhelming this way and then I can feel like one class is ""done"" for awhile. 

I don't usually work in the evenings, but I sometimes go into my classroom for 3-4 hours on a Saturday to organize papers, plan, and grade and I find that time really valuable. Grading essays takes long chunks of uninterrupted time and that's always been hard for me to manage at school. 

You might also just take a day off school to grade. I did this a few weeks ago and managed to finish a set of essays and hand them back the next day. And I got to do it in a cozy coffee shop. 

I will say that we English teachers have it tough. I know that teaching is hard for every subject and every grade, but I think we grade more than most other subjects. I've heard teachers say that they never take work home, but I've never heard that from a high school English teacher. "
highschoolteachers,"I taught high school from 22-25.  Had same issue.  All of my friends had regular day jobs and I was done with everything (grading etc) usually by 330.  I wish I did more than I did with my time looking back now.  

1. Played a lot of golf, I looked really young, and so usually got student twilight rate.  You get to meet a lot of cops, and firemen on their off days.  They have good stories.
2. Use that teacher's discount!  Book stores.  Get all of your shopping done when there's no one at the stores.
3. Sign up for all the local volunteering opportunities.  Need to look a little bit harder for the weekday afternoon stuff. 
4. Coach a sports team."
highschoolteachers,"ah, sorry. In Oregon, it means I can work in junior high and high school. My option (just limited by the school to prevent overloading) was two content areas and one authorization (JH, SH) or the reverse. I chose one subject, because frankly, that's what I really wanted to teach and I thought spreading my ability to teach multiple grades would help with hiring."
highschoolteachers,"I'd love your job, no lie. I know you must feel super unfulfilled having only two students right now but this is your opportunity to work on building your program! Brainstorm! Find opportunities for community based vocational instruction. I know you say that it has to be individualized, but you can still have the students at the same job site just performing different tasks. One student can clean while the other takes food orders OR one can file while the other makes copies OR one can stock shelves while the other helps the cashier. You can even break down the individual job tasks for a single ""job"" to suit each kid. If a receptionist normally answers the phones, escorts clients, and does basic filing, you can assign each of those tasks to a different kid.

With the kitchen, can you arrange that on certain days the students' transportation takes them to the other building instead of the main classroom? Go over there for a full day, teach them to bake cookies, then sell those cookies to the high school students between classes. That will teach them cooking skills, money math, and social skills (being able to ask a perfect stranger to buy something is totally a social skill!).

Sorry, transition is my dream and I love it. "
highschoolteachers,"9th-12th.
I love that they ""get"" the WHY of something. I love that they can given a large open-ended project and be ""set free"" to work on it for an hour without small tasks and prompting. I love that I can wander around the room helping each student without worrying about what the other students are doing.

I hate teen attitudes and dating drama. I hate that the parents mostly quit once their kid hits high school - I want to shake them and scream ""now is the MOST IMPORTANT because if they fail they don't graduate!!!!!"" "
highschoolteachers,"Jeez, this is rough for the para. My wife worked as one for a while, and the workload was brutal and the pay was low. I can't imagine if she were hospitalized on top of that. 

I would suggest several things.

1: Buy or make a card (If you teach grade school, have students make it, if you teach middle/high school, buy one) and have all of the students that she works with sign it. 

2: Actually visit her in the hospital and bring her the card. That would probably mean a lot. 

3: Once you are sure that she is legitimately sick, cover for her. Tell your admin that you'd missed a text or a voicemail or email. and that she had told you she was going to the hospital. This might make it harder for them to find reason to fire her. 

These are just my opinions, of course. "
highschoolteachers,Speaking and Listening is an entire section in the Common Core Standards for high school ELA.
highschoolteachers,"In general having an ESL and/or ELL qualifications make you much,  much more attractive,  as the first poster says.  Or minor in a language that is in high demand in the areas that you're looking at.  You don't have to teach that language - just being able to converse with those students as they adjust to English full time at school is a huge,  huge perk.  I'll be teaching English via an alt cert route in a high school this Fall, and I really,  really wish I had done Spanish in college instead of German.  Ah well. "
highschoolteachers,"Using 13 year old high school history books here. Not like anything big has happened in the last 13 years, right?"
highschoolteachers,"I could say the same for writing essays and analyzing literature. Most students will never have to do these things, but they help in other aspects of life. Most of your students will apply for a job at some point in their lives. Some might be interviewed by the cops. Others will have to give a speech at a funeral. Public speaking transcends beyond just giving a presentation. It's important for students to get that experience. Making excuses for them to not gain that experience does them a huge disservice.

I'm not saying throw the girl who cries in front of people to the front of the class like everyone else. You can modify. Have a few kids she's not close with stay after school to listen to her presentation instead of just you, for example. Every time she presents, increase the number of students. But don't just have it be you alone. That's not public speaking.

But what really bothers me about this is the notion that she thinks she shouldn't be graded for not even trying. That's the complete opposite of what she will experience beyond high school. It's really popular for people these days to complain that they never learned about balancing a checkbook, investing in the stock market, opening a bank account, etc. But we're prepared to shelter students from talking to their peers? L-O-fucking-L"
highschoolteachers,This is how I felt in high school too.
highschoolteachers,"I had (and even still have to an extent) a serious fear of public speaking. I have to really prepare myself for it and kind of brace myself for it. So, the best course of action for me was to give lots of advance notice. For example, one day when I was in high school we had to a writing assignment, and then after we were done (with no warning at all) she told us we had to read them all out loud. I honestly lost it, left the room and everything. 

I'm sure there was plenty of advanced notice for this presentation, but some people like your student may need some time to really work themselves up for public speaking, so maybe give her some time to do that before a presentation. Let her step out a minute to get herself ready?"
highschoolteachers,"While I was student teaching, I used a Netti pot to help keep away colds, and it worked, but it got too annoying and so I stopped.  

Unfortunately, this is just a reality of being a teacher, but it gets better over the years.  Are you a beginning teacher?  My first 4 years (2 subbing, 2 full time in high school) I was sick every month without fail.  This year, I have only been sick once (knock on wood!), so it does get better, though it takes time for your immune system to catch up.

Though I have heard that every 7 years or so, teachers immune systems do another ""reset"" and are sick all over again...so something to look forward to..."
highschoolteachers,"I kinda disagree with you and hear me out, student is a high school kid, not a 4th grader, he will soon be transitioning slowly into the real world with real consequences for behaviors. I think there comes a point where yes even autistic kids must receive tough love or discipline like any other child in order to learn and understand boundaries and acceptable social behavior as they approach adulthood, unless the goal is simply to institutionalize them which I think we would both agree wouldn't be a good thing. Not sure if you saw but recently an autistic 18 year old was sentenced to a pretty lengthy prison term for what the family claimed was ""accidentally"" setting the house on fire, a fire in which a toddler was killed. Whatever the reason whether intentional or accidental, whether or not he should or should not have been left alone with the toddler, whether he thought it was a joke or if it was malicious, its irreverent, I think the takeaway here is that he is being held accountable for it by the justice system. I do believe in accommodation, but I also believe that high functioning autistic kids need to understand boundaries and consequences as they approach adulthood, better that this happened in a classroom then somewhere in public where maybe collateral damage lead to a lawsuit or jail or even personal injury to a child, because again, unless the goal is to simply institutionalize these kids, they have got to understand consequence because the real world cuts people very little slack whether you are autistic or completely normal functioning. a grade schooler, yeah, you handle that differently, high schooler likely about to start his transitioning into adulthood and the real world, this isnt as terrible a thing as you may think at first glance."
highschoolteachers,"Is enrollment through the roof or are the schools so underfunded that class sizes are through the roof? I would guess that the tax base in Detroit is very low. 

The other thing is that schools are generally funded on a per-student basis. A school has certain fixed costs - an elementary school needs a librarian whether it has 250 students or 500 students. In a smaller school, a larger portion of each student's funding is required to pay for the librarian. 

In high schools, the effect is even worse. A small high school can't offer as many electives as a larger one - which makes the school less attractive, which drives families away, which reduces the number of electives..."
highschoolteachers,"Yes....if you want us to teach college level curriculum in high school, expect us to teach college level curriculum exactly like it is.  "
highschoolteachers,"I think the homework debate really shows the grade level, subject, and parental support that teacher (or parent) sees.

I do assign homework in high school science, as it is the most efficient way to differentiate research and essays and give enough time for students of various levels, their adult helpers (in and outside of school), and individual interest to work.  I also give generous due dates and format, so that they can find the time to get it done.  I regard ""flipping"" a science classroom as a total disaster and a waste of time.

Also, I don't have a class set of books, so they access their giant textbook and other materials at home (as making them bring it to school often is, in my opinion, a medical discourtesy)."
highschoolteachers,"A big problem with not giving homework is that it leaves student unprepared for higher educations. When you get into a college/university after you got straight out of high school without having to do homework. You are gonna be in a bit of a shock. You suddenly have a lot more personal responsibility and are forced to do a lot more work outside of school hours. This becomes even more apparent when you have to write large reports or papers that can span days or weeks.

Sure you have the time because the amount of class hours went down but try to place yourself in a students shoes. They went from doing everything within school hours under subervision even. To having a full agenda of preparing/reading and writing every week. It's really hard to just suddenly flip a switch and motivate yourself to do all of that extra work.

I see a lot of people here complaining that homework is never done or that its useless. Then get to improving it and create some way to motivate them to actually doing it. It's not just your job to teach them your subject you are also raising them to be adults. And part of that is being able to work on your own and managing time. Do away with brain dead excersises. Make sure to check if the homework is actually done if you do give it. You might even give a grade once per period or year based on the completing of homework. If I tell students they can get a 10/10 for doing their homework well it gets their attention. Go down a grade everytime they fail to do so and make sure to enforce it well."
highschoolteachers,"I've got a couple of perspectives on this.

Firstly, as a student I never really minded a bit of homework. The homework I got in primary school was maybe 20 minutes a night (spelling list and one small activity which we picked from a sheet each night). When I got into high school, especially my senior years, I definitely learned more at home than in the classroom. My friends were in my class, I spent a lot of time goofing around and getting distracted by them. When I got home, though, I was alone and would force myself to do the work. I ended up ranking in the top four for four of my six classes.

As a prac teacher, I understand that all students do not do homework. I have not set explicit homework as it is not my supervising teachers standard policy. But I can see it having an effect on the students. In class you only have a certain amount of time, and I have yet to see the evidence (in the real-world) of students not doing homework attaining in the top 20% of the state in the end-of-school exam. And I know exams are not the be all and end all of learning, but even anecdotally, students aren't reaching the higher-level learning skills necessary for full comprehension of the topic in the small amount of time in the classroom. And then there's the whole point of memory and students not actually soaking things up into long-term memory without further prompting. And considering that 4-6 marks in the end-of-school exam can come from one word within the syllabus, they really are expected to know these things."
highschoolteachers,"I also teach two different high school AP courses, and vocabulary is still the biggest shortfall for most of my students. Many of my students are readers, but they aren't engaging challenging material in their personal reading time. They are most reading YA fiction, which is at a fifth-eighth grade literacy level. 

My only homework for the courses is reading from the text, we do in depth analytical work and writings in class. Yet my students complain about the burden of reading six-eight textbook pages an evening. 

I think the concern of any good teacher is that our kids are grossly unprepared for college, and what we are expecting of them is the minimum required to be on that college path.

In short I have had several full blown conferences with parents and administration over the ""ridiculous"" standards I am holding my students to. Such as reading a handful of pages and being able to answer simple comprehension questions, or write analytically about the topic. "
highschoolteachers,"What do you think students who don't need the repetition learn from your homework assignments? 
I wish high school teachers would assign work based on a student's needs. My high school senior is taking three AP classes and three high school level classes. Our school tells students to expect two hours of homework a night in an AP class. That's 540 hours of class and homework time per class. They're meant to be equivalent to a five credit college course. Next year, she'll be expected to cover the same material in 180 hours. (12 week quarter, five hours of class per week, two hours of outside work per day.) Too much unnecessary homework is assigned in high school.

On teaching work habits - that's not what we send them to school to learn. If I want her to learn to work, I'll suggest she get a job or I'll give her things to do. Just teach them science. Assign the amount of work they need to learn the material. Don't expect them to do unnecessary repetitive work just because some of their classmates might need it."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with you that homework is generally over-assigned. I have three children - two in high school and one in elementary school. The youngest attends a school with a no-homework policy. Teachers are not allowed to assign work to be done outside the school day. There is an expectation that child will spend time reading independently - because that's what literate people do. Parents are expected to help their children learn their math facts in first/second/third grade because that does require some extra repetition. There are no reading logs or math worksheets to return to school. 
My oldest is a senior in high school and has taken several (many?) AP classes. She's been assigned more work than I ever did in college - plus of course is in class six hours a day. It's just wrong. 

I would tell your daughter's teacher that the homework is a burden for your family and she will only be completing assignments that you feel are valuable and necessary. When she gets to middle school, math practice could be helpful and when she learns a second language, that will take time outside of school. Until then, give her back her childhood."
highschoolteachers,"30 minutes per class for a child in middle or high school could be three hours a night. 
Does the homework you assign always have a purpose? Is it always suitable/helpful for every child in your classes? Is it more valuable than anything else that child might have done with the time? How do you know?
The idea that the children who do the homework don't benefit from it (would have been successful without it) and the children who do need it get no benefit becuase they don't have the support they need at home to be successful resonates with me. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science and I assign homework. In my chemistry class, it is a necessity. In order to master the material, students must spend extra time practicing the material. If I took that time in class, we would never get close to finishing the curriculum.

However the main reason why I I've homework is because it is a skill and a necessity for students to learn to balance their life between work, family, and friends. Many salaried jobs that you start will require working unpaid extra time in order to learn the material. As a teacher who is teaching a subject for the first time, I work outside of normal school hours. And this is because I want to do a good job. As I learn howl teach the material and become a better teacher, the amount of time I will need to spend outside of work will decrease. It is important that students learn how to prioritize and manage their time so that they can learn what they have to.

Because students are the sum of their habits, assigning sporadic projects would not develop these habits because students would not learn how to prioritize their time on a regular basis. Instead, constant feedback through small assignments is the best way to teach this. Once students can manage their time with smaller assignments, that's when they can advance to larger projects. "
highschoolteachers,"This sounds like me when I was that age. I was diagnosed with oppositional defiance disorder as a kid, and it was just like someone would throw a switch and I'd unload every small frustration on whoever was currently annoying me.  It went away on its own as I grew up, but the bullying that came with it persisted until high school, so make sure you keep an eye on that.

It's really late but tomorrow I'll see if I can come up with any strategies."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;  if you teach in the affluent areas your job will be significantly easier simply because the students are from a more privileged household which generally provides them with all the tools necessary to be successful in school.

This is true, however I teach in an affluent school (decile 10 all boys' high school in New Zealand) and it's not just parent drama that can be a pain - it's student entitlement and a lack of respect. They are often very arrogant. They believe they know better than me a lot of the time, question everything I do, try to argue with me about everything I say, try to test me on my knowledge to call me out, try to convince me that they should be doing something else that *they* want to do, send every damn assignment back to be re-assessed ""just in case"" their mark goes up, try to get me to just give them all the answers instead of doing the work themselves, tell me how they intentionally book appointments during my class because they don't value the subject (okay that was just one guy, haha) and on. I never had that when I was student teaching at a low decile school. 

Then there is a TON of pressure from the school to always be working at the highest level, even though some students can barely write an essay and I have to spend ages going back to basics. 

Not to mention the homophobia and sexism that I have to deal with. The up side is that I feel like they are the types of boys who have missed out on a lot of lessons that will stop them being douchebags and so I'm hopefully making them better people, one class discussion at a time. 

Also you'd assume being at one of the best schools in the country there would be little need for behaviour management, but there are still huge problems (although mainly in the Drama classroom). I've had afternoons where I've cried in my office thinking I want to quit teaching because they've been so impossible to deal with, although I think I've greatly improved my classroom management. I think a shock student teachers get is that when they are on placements the class are amazingly well behaved because the associate teacher has made them that way and you are walking into a controlled classroom... get your own class and you'll find they aren't so perfect and you need to put the work in getting them that way.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the grass is always greener and even affluent schools can be shit to work in sometimes.

Despite all I just said, I do still enjoy it here for the most part, and I know I definitely have it way easier than teachers in some of the poorer schools where they face far bigger problems - from drugs, to illiteracy, to absenteeism, to violence, to lack of funding. "
highschoolteachers,"I can't really help you with the timeline or lesson transcripts from the 1980s, as that's a bit before my time. 

As an immigrant in an American high school in 1990s, though, I can provide a personal experience: getting into AP classes required good grades and going to the guidance counselor and asking to go into AP classes. Nobody asked me to demonstrate advanced knowledge of anything. 

I got good grades freshman year and asked my counselor about registering for AP in English, math, chemistry and physics.  My counselor did require my 9th grade teachers to sign off. The only one that gave me any sort of trouble was the English teacher. She told me that she thought I wouldn't do well as a nonnative speaker, but that she'd sign off on it if that's what I wanted to do.

The other teachers merely signed off on the paper without a single comment. 

I have a feeling, though, that the information you want will vary from state to state and from school district to school district. 



"
highschoolteachers,"Talk to an administrator about it, your school might have a policy. My high school has a policy that if a parent does not want their student to read a certain  book, then they must be provided with a different book and assignments to be graded on. Many of our English teachers have a list of contingency books to use. Usually the students have a set of questions to go with each chapter and then a big test or essay at the end of it."
highschoolteachers,"Sounds like an arbitrary choice to me. If student grades follow a normal distribution (i.e., bell curve), then that implies that there is a sufficiently large number of random variables that affect their grade. The key there is ""random"" variables. 

This might make sense if you took the average grades of a very large sample, like district or statewide... but I would actually see it as very bad if something as small as a high school class showed a bell curve. This would imply that you, the teacher, would be one of many other random variables that averaged out to give a bell curve distribution of grades.. i.e., your effect on their grade doesn't overpower the effects due to other effects.

There's a lot more to it than that, but that's how I think about it. As someone else in this post said, the bell curve model of what student grades should look like is woefully outdated. Hell, the 100-point grading system itself is way outdated. There's no evidence-based reason that a 70/100 is considered adequate or that even grading stuff out of 100 points is best. It's just the way that it's been done based on beliefs and philosophies of the late 1800's/early 1900's. 

I'd look into standards-based learning. Way better than traditional grading."
highschoolteachers,"Bahaha, I use stamps and my upperclassmen are, likewise, ecstatic. Glad to hear I'm not the only high school teacher who does fun stuff like this! :) "
highschoolteachers,"I had a disabled teacher in high school. She was pretty much the same as my other high school teachers as far as how she ran her class. Her room was on the first floor , she had a bell on her chair that she would ring so students would get out of her way in the hall. Kids respected her she had good class room managment. She was the first disabled person I really interacted with on a regular basis and because she was confident and comfortable , so was I . I hope that is somewhat helpful, best of luck. "
highschoolteachers,"It looks like the United Federation of Teachers has a committee for ""capably disabled"" teachers. You can probably get tons of great information from them. 

http://www.uft.org/committees/capably-disabled

Building off sgntpepper03's question, it seems like it would almost be a non-issue in upper elementary/middle school or secondary. If you want to teach, like, high school chemistry, that could be a problem maybe, but otherwise, I think you'd be fine. 

I don't have any permanent issues myself, but I teach high school biology and between my colleagues and myself, we've had our fair share of injuries and issues. Doesn't really seem to be a barrier. Working in a school with very cooperative students might be biasing me there, though, because they'll actually help out if something needs to be reached, carried, etc. 

You might want to be slightly selective about your eventual placement - which could happen even if you don't intend it. I could see a school with more behavior management issues passing on you without giving you a chance, while those with fewer might be interested in the perspective that you can offer to the students."
highschoolteachers,"If your standards are high and your students are meeting them then great!

But that's the thing. Your standards should be high. Teaching high school and I'm getting tired of students coming into high school with absolutely no clue how to do school. On top of the new (and sometimes difficult) content they also have to learn how to deal with greater expectations for their work. Too many students ask me every single day ""Does it really have to be in a complete sentence?"" when I say ""Yes, it does"" I get a huge sigh and even then half of them don't write in a complete sentence.

Because I can see in the future our new way of communicating: text speak. That'll definitely go over well."
highschoolteachers,"We had one when I was in high school about a year after Columbine.

February.  New York.  Outside.  Three hours."
highschoolteachers,"I've had two high school students straight up walk out of my room. Both had major behavior issues in all classes and no IEP. Both times I immediately alerted the office and continued teaching class like normal. 

Edit: one of these students is the reason we now have the policy that, if you leave school grounds without permission, a parent must escort you back into school. No idea whether it's a policy that's working, since I currently don't have either of those students. "
highschoolteachers,"Seattle has a teacher shortage.  My school started off the year with a few subs in core academic classes.  Other schools are experiencing similar hardships.

The school that I got hired at has a very diverse community.  I have years of professional experience and academic training for meeting their needs.  I emphasize differentiation, sheltered English for ELLs, and alternative/authentic assessment in my lessons.  That's some of what the school needs.  And it's what I offer.

Years ago, Florida dealt with its teacher shortage issue by having a more open pathway to certification.  To be a substitute teacher in many counties in Florida, you only need a high school diploma.  There's an argument to be made about how that affects talent in the classroom and wages.  But that's the way it is.  Conversely, substitute teachers in Seattle have to have to be certificated just like full-time teachers.  How many people with that level of specialized education would choose to substitute teach at a lower pay rate instead of work as a full-time teacher?  Not many.  Hence the shortage."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the input.  I'll try to go that route.

I already completed my GKT (Reading, Writing, and Math), the PeD exam, and the Subject Area Exams for my three endorsements.  I've heard mixed solutions from the FLDOE about how to fulfill any additional requirements to go from Temporary to Professional.  One of those solutions involved taking an online class through Keiser.  'Eh, I'll do whatever works.

As for the no-pay thing - that's being resolved.  Right now I'm classified as an Emergency Substitute Teacher. I was classified as a Certificated teaching when I was initially hired.  So payroll is going to work out the retropay thing for me.  It'll just take a few days.

I was awarded my Temporary certificate in Florida.  I was hired to teach high school in January."
highschoolteachers,"It's one that you can show on the board, and the kids don't truly need to use it as home as well...but it's helpful if they can. It's better for high school than class dojo, but that one is amazing for elementary.

I'm lucky that I work at a school that recently got funding to pilot iPads for every student next year."
highschoolteachers,"I worked in one of the lawrence high schools for 3 years (up until the end of last year). I really liked a lot of the students, but teaching there was tough. There was very little discipline at the school, which depending on the class could make learning difficult. "
highschoolteachers,"I've been through versions of all 3 (Suburbs, Rural, and Urban). All 3 had their own differences and similarities. I'd say the rural and urban districts were most similar, and it's due to socioeconomic status and culture.

I grew up in a fairly affluent and boring **Suburb**. 

* Obviously I was just a student, but most kids were like me and grew up in a community that promoted learning and good behavior. 
* Most problems were class disruptions like chatting and laziness. 
* Maybe 4-8 kids per grade level had some behavior issues, but these were attention or disruption related. Even those kids were nothing compared to the percentages at rural or urban areas.

I student taught and worked 2 supplemental gigs at 2 fairly poor **Rural** school districts in the midwest. Both had small populations of around 300-400 kids in the high school depending on what year it was.

* The biggest issues were cultural; kids in a rural district grew up with hands-on activities and don't translate well to sit-down-and-quietly-work activities. Obviously every school has this problem, but I found it much more noticeable at the rural districts. Who cares about story structure when you have a job lifting hay bails after school and you're contributing to paying bills for your family?
* Both rural districts also seemed to have a growing drug/substance problem. Kids get bored and find the wrong kind of friends fairly easily. Perhaps it was more noticeable because of the small population?
* A lot of kids who came from great households and families were much better students, but it wasn't as normal or concentrated as a suburban school. 

My first and current full time gig is in one of the worst **Urban** school districts in the US. The city's population is about 100k with a handful of school districts, but I work at the ""ghetto school district"" with about 1000-1200 kids in the high school depending on who decides to drop. 

The school I work at is a small K-8 school in the district's poorest area and it has less than 200 kids. About 20 kids per grade level.

* All students are below the poverty line and get free lunches and breakfast. 
* The district's graduation rate is low, so there is a new push against suspensions and expulsions. This creates a culture of kids staying in school *but getting away with too much*. 
* Kids are incredibly reactionary and not great at listening. They will comment on everything they hear/see/think without filters. This creates an unbelievable amount of unnecessary class disruption. Every dumb or smart thought is public and there's no waiting for an instructor to comment or help. Maybe it's because families shout each other down, maybe it's because kids learned to raise themselves. Who knows.
* Fights, emotional breakdowns, verbal abuse; it's all unfortunately common. There's usually 1 or 2 kids sitting in the office every day for suspensions.
* The kids go through so much that you don't see. Poverty, family abuse, family tragedies, parents-who-shouldn't-be-parents. A lot of the things that cause them troubles aren't even their fault, and it's incredibly frustrating and heartbreaking to watch."
highschoolteachers,"Do you have a school library teacher who could back you up on the quality of reading materials? Graphic novels and manga are all the rage in my high school, and they serve as a great entry point to learning to love reading. "
highschoolteachers,"I was actually 20 minutes earlier than the contracted teacher arrival time.  

At my high school teachers are only required to be there 15 minutes before the first bell; I know that was shocking to me too, but I was there another 20 minutes earlier to be safe, so 35 minutes before first bell.  Beat most of the seasoned teachers in so I could get parking, get my keys and everything else. 

I was really sad though, later in the day when I saw our student parking lot was 90% empty, and when I asked another teacher about it he said only about 6 of our juniors and seniors have cars, so there will always be teacher parking."
highschoolteachers,"Literally this, I come home and my wife asks how my day was and I say ""It was fine how was your day?""  and then I think to myself exactly like you.  ""Well there was one kid that had a meltdown and took all of the crayons at his table hid under the table broke all the crayons and was screaming and laughing while throwing them at me, and there was a kid that ran out of the school and almost into traffic, and there was a kid who was stomping on another kids head, and another that when reminded to listen would yell throughout the entire lesson.  But, it didn't really stress me out.  

Now that being said, I think I would likely get stressed out if these were high school students or adults, I just happen to have an unlimited amount of patience and resolve when it comes to younger kids.  If there was a smartass 9th grader doing stuff like that I would probably say something I shouldn't.  I knew that though when I began my education that is why I went for a k-6 license. "
highschoolteachers,"I have had two high school freshmen who would do this. One of them is this year. The first one had autism and was bullied at a previous school, and that became the coping mechanism. I tried really hard to set up a safe environment, and to shut down any type of goofing-off behavior, and didn't have any issues with the student leaving my room.

The student I have this year has some type of emotional disturbance (per the IEP). I haven't yet figured out why this student leaves the room. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything that is actually happening in class, because twice the student has left at the very beginning of class, before the bell has even rung.

In both cases, the student's Case Manager documented the problem, and there was an aide for the special ed department who we are supposed to notify when the student leaves. The aide will then search for the student, and either escort the student to the case manager for counseling or back to my room."
highschoolteachers,"You're not! I give students a few to arrive, and talk quietly among themselves while they get settled and begin copying their objective. I sometimes chat with them during this time. After the late bell rings, I call them to attention, and we begin class. This is completely the opposite of what I was taught during my teacher training - we were encouraged to stand by the door and greet each student individually with a handshake. I did that teaching MS, but my high school students seem to be fine with entering on their own.

The same with dismissal. I make an effort to end class on the time, but they always wait for me to dismiss them, and will usually wait if I ask, even after the bell rings."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; After about 5 minutes, I go over the warmup and the homework with a clear deadline in my head. We have 10 minutes to be done. That might mean not going over all of the warmup problems today or just taking 2 questions on homework.
&gt; 

It's a judgement call.  If EVERYONE doesn't get it and you know it's a skill they need, sometimes you can give them a day.  Throw maybe just one or two more examples at them the second day and then give them most of the period to practice so you can roam and address individual concerns.

If it's just a handful, then it's more on them to seek out help.

If you're teaching high school math, I have about 10 years worth of resources that I'm happy to share with you.  Shoot me a PM if you're interested."
highschoolteachers,We had a fire bug at my high school. Did stuff like that at least once a month until caught. 
highschoolteachers,"Great prompt.

English teacher here, in an inner city high school.  I have students on all sorts of meds - and some, as well, who we know are supposed to be, but aren't, or not regularly.  It would be great to understand better the cycles of some of these meds, as they have consequences for classroom behavior - a student who is ""on"" and focused first thing in the morning, but right before lunch is fatigued and frazzled, is often assumed to be in that state because his meds are ""wearing off"" - but it is the meds?  Is it side effects of coming down?  Is that ""the kid under the meds""?   Related issues, too - when a parent refuses to give her child the assigned medication, or poverty in our inner city keeps kids from taking their meds regularly, what can I expect?

In short, the more we know about what our kids are really experiencing as they go through med cycles for anxiety, adhd, detox, weed and crack, even chemo - all of which I am currently looking at in my English classes - or fall off them for any reason, the more we can differentiate for them, be proactive about how to teach them, know when to lay off them for a bit and when to come back, etc - we can just plain teach them better.   IEPs don't tell us much - a pharmacist's perspective here would be invaluable.   And honestly, though officially I know I need to know more about the prescription issues, I also would love to have an hour on strategies for working with people who are just plain high but need to be taught anyway, lest I get put on probation for not reaching every kid in the classroom."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English, and when we are about two chapters into a book, I do Criticism/ Question/ Compliment

Students write a question they have about the book so far (lets me gauge if they are understanding it) a criticism and a compliment. 

Then we circle up and have a whole class discussion where EVERYONE needs to participate.

Kids ask questions, other students answer, they get to complain, and then we end on a positive note. It always works like a charm, and is great for when you are being observed. "
highschoolteachers,"Middle school 8: Late assignments I only take one day late for 1/2 credit. I developed this when I taught high school. Still maintain it for MS. 

Make up work: They have X number of missed days to complete. The late policy is still in effect if they don't turn it in. 

Student Accountability: I hold high standards on everything but at home reading. And that's because I have not found a way to get them to do this. No matter if it is 2 pages or 10, they won't read. I'd rather read it in class with them, have them understand as we read, and then work on critical thinking skills, than spend an entire period recalling and regurgitating information. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a dept head in a large high school. A few years ago I had an LTS who was sarcastic and snippy with kids. A few students told me that she made them feel dumb.

This person also alienated much of the dept. She interrupted, argued against advice that she asked for, dominated conversations. 

I had to have several difficult conversations with her. She was blind-sided every time. She thought her students loved her, thought she was doing a great job, argued me on every point about her performance and the way she interacted with others. She didn't get hired, and I had three jobs the following year. 

I tell this story because self-evaluation and reflection is a valuable tool. I've been teaching 21 years and I still kick myself when I make a dumb joke or something comes out wrong.I'm thinking you should reflect on how you are being perceived and consider whether your managers could interpret a smile as a sneer or whatever.    "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I treat them like near-adults who don't need a prison-style drill to arrive and leave, and sometimes need a minute or two to blow off steam; in return they work hard with only a little occasional prodding to get going. Never had a single problem."
highschoolteachers,"I don't think it's unreasonable to have them do a simple name tag (they might love to decorate it since it's art) and then just say their names at least once a class in direct conversation. 
ex, ""Wow, Gail, you're doing a lovely job..."" or ""You have a fine color system here, Cole, but try adding more reds..."". I don't know anything about art and my art teacher in high school would just criticize constantly and she died not knowing my name. "
highschoolteachers,"Where I am we have a basic sex ed class for 1 hour a day for 1 week. In 4th, 5th, and 6th grade. In those classes you learn what genitals are,  how sex works, and about puberty. Then in 9th grade the kids will take a semester of health with a section on sex ed.

I took my health class online in high school to free up my schedule so I can't go into detail about the class. The only know two specifics about the health class where I now work. I know that the teacher puts a condom on her foot and says, ""If a boy ever tells you a condom is too small, you should run for the hills because that thing will split you in half,"" and I know that she will answer any serious question related to sex. 

I also know there are some areas that only teach sex ed in high school and don't teach safe sex practices. Instead they teach the children that they should only have sex once they are married. Those areas tend to have higher teenage pregnancy rates. 

As for your questions, 30% of US internet traffic is pornography, and it is very easy to access. Pornography represents idealized situations with lots of practice and prep work. In the US I feel like kids need to learn about sex from an adult, otherwise they will likely try to learn from the easily accessible pornography. I think children need to learn the basics of sex before puberty, but they don't need an in depth class until they are closer to being emotionally ready to have sex. "
highschoolteachers,"My experience is entirely in middle and high school, with students sat in rows facing the front. Hopefully there's something here you can run with, even if your particular seating arrangement doesn't allow for my particular strategy.

It's important that even the disruptive kids be given a chance to stay in class - when they're preventing other kids around them from learning, this is where they're at their most disruptive. Many teachers ""solve"" this by removing the child from class, but this should be the absolute last resort. Instead, **move them away from where they like to sit. Right now, they're surrounded by an audience, and they're in their element. I've found that moving even one of the more disruptive talkers from a group tends to quiet the entire room down considerably**; your mileage may vary.

Once you've pinpointed the prime talker in a given area, be ready to move their seat - obviously this works better with assigned seating. You can even warn the child in question that he will be moved - do this privately, preferably before or just after class. Something like ""you are talking too much in class, and it's disruptive. I know others are talking, but you have to be responsible for your own actions. If you can't show me that you're ready to be responsible, I'm going to have to move you to another seat."" If he or she persists, move him (or her) to a corner. I prefer the front row, extreme right or left - this will limit his or her potential audience. Only one person to the side at most, and it will be obvious if they turn around to start talking to somebody behind them.  

Again, this might not be applicable to the layout of a third grade classroom. Then again, drastic times might call for drastic measures. You don't necessarily have to go full-on rows facing front like the classrooms I'm used to, but I remain convinced that isolation from an audience is key. 

TL;DR - Move them. Right now, they're surrounded by an audience, and they're in their element. Moving even one talker from their current group tends make for a noticeably more quiet room."
highschoolteachers,"Oh hey. My life Last year.

Read everything HarlowMonroe said and I have some more to add. The guy before me at my school told me to have zero expectations and teaching the class has been so much better with that expectation. Assume the students know nothing and you can build from there. In Title I schools, the students are hand fed material in the lower grades and expect it once they get to the high school level.

Going from there, I break things into much smaller chunks that they can handle on their own. I can spend anywhere from 3 days to a week on one topic, e.g. Predator-prey relationships. If the skills aren't there then you have to show them what to do and then practice over and over until they get it. Presentations are a struggle for me because the practice was never there and students did not know what to do to even start. Scaffolding in terms of steps helps a lot for a project. 

Even if you have to spend two days on ""How to research a topic"" you have to do it to teach the skill. Maybe a day on ""Finding a good resource"" will be another day and ""how to research vocabulary terms"" could be another day. You will have to show them how to do this if the skills aren't there. 

Welcome to teaching :D"
highschoolteachers,"I believe one problem may be that this two-question approach isn't a smooth entry point for a deep conversation about career choices. For just a couple examples...

1) At 17 or 18, a student may not even be aware of her/his own strongest aptitudes, even if they are academic or quasi-academic. Even with a robust set of electives or extracurriculars, little Timmy may just have never discovered he's a NATURAL at running statistics on the high school baseball games.

2) Students may have interests or aptitudes that they don't realize (nor their parents/mentors realize) can be actual careers. Puzzle/adventure video games have plenty of skillset overlap with things such as archaeology, forensics, and so forth. If you enjoy sports but maybe can't go pro, that interest can be ""parlayed"" into work as a physical trainer, a rehab therapist, a professional mascot(!), etc.

If you're serious about this process of the students making career choices, does your school have any system for them taking one of those comprehensive aptitude tests?"
highschoolteachers,"The satisfaction of the job comes randomly; you set up the plans to work, and, if they work well, you feel good. 

It took me a year and a half initially to begin feeling really good. Then the whole process of teaching began to feel like a part of me. After awhile you sharpen and heighten your abilities to a point where the whole profession feels like a natural progression, an extension of your normal brain functions. 

From all novice teachers I know, their timeline breaks up in this pattern:
Year One: figuring out what planning a lesson means
Year Two: fixing major planning mistakes of year one
 Fixing major procedure/management issues
Year Three: fixing and enhancing good lessons
Scripting/designing cool means of engagement
Making procedures seamless, patterned, no opt outs on behavior or performance
Year Four: deciding on a grad school/new responsibility in the dept., getting timing right
Refining curriculum, writing tests, earning grants, mentoring younger teachers
Year Five: cultivating learners from day one and keeping them serious/focused until day one-eighty
( a very challenging feat)

On (giving up) the false, unfair, self-pressured expectations of the label ""teacher"":
You can have periods in your career when you have to be a 6am-4pm teacher, like when your dad's in the hospital or when your cat had kittens. But you should never strive to be the in'n'out teacher; you should strive to be ""effective"" (below is what I mean by effective, it takes work and skill... I've never met a ""day job"" teacher who really does these...)

Effectiveness is not a buzzword; effectiveness is a mindset, a practice, a set of rituals, a complex list of plans, problems, and solutions...etc. Effectiveness is about how you can turn any life experience(in real time or the past) into a teachable moment. Effectiveness is about how you can make the environment a safe, openly communicative, highly academic and fun. (If the walls in your room could tell others about the types of learning that go on in your room, what would they say?) Effectiveness is about giving students reasons to desire learning; this can include relevance, purpose, extended sources, fascinating connections, personal anecdotes, after school opportunities like documentary screenings or multi class discussions, etc.

You can be an average teacher; no one will really care if that is what you desire from the profession. Plenty of teachers strive for mediocrity. Some are forced into mediocrity; some are weakened by the school systems. I think teaching is only transformative (for both teacher and student), when the student can palpably see the care, effort, interest, academic seriousness, and enjoyment that the teacher puts in. 

So, what could help these feelings?
Success.
Maybe start small, explain how you worked on something, how you enjoyed a set of projects, how cool something will be to learn about, etc. Make enthusiasm infectious; let them feel your love for the subject and their engagement (esp. in high school)"
highschoolteachers,"yep. I'm teaching sciences in high school. Here is my last year costume, and as I changed school this year, probably my costume for this year as well.

highschoolteachers,"The VCLA is cake. My high schoolers could probably pass it. Did you take the Praxis II English exam? You'll need that one.

This is the website you want to check out: http://teachvirginia.org/

If you want to start teaching right away, your best bet is the career switcher program. Career switchers teach while they are working on licensure requirements. To get a provisional license, you have to be hired by a school system first. English 6-12 is a shortage area, but it's at the bottom of the list so it may be harder to find a system willing to hire someone who doesn't have a license. "
highschoolteachers,"Our biggest fundraising items are chips and canned sodas, as far as selling things go. However, we make way more money doing penny wars. Look it up! Basically, each class or teacher is trying to get the most points by collecting pennies. Students from other classes can sabotage with nickels, dimes, and quarters which are all negative points. I work at a high school and have seen kids put five or even ten dollar bills in to stop another class from winning.  "
highschoolteachers,"Honestly? Easiest way is to kick him out. At that point, he is an adult and should know better. He is disrupting the education others are paying for. If he refuses to leave, alert campus security.

If you want to take the authoritative route, hold him after class. Let him know that this is not high school, and that class clown behavior is not tolerated. Ask him why he does what he does. If he's a genuine asshole, ask your department what the next step is after you've addressed his behavior.

If you don't already, dress professionally. I tell my tenth graders that teaching is a professional job, so I dress like a professional. I get a modicum more respect just for that. Do not yell over him. My favorite phrase is ""see me after class"" to a disruptive student. They quiet down, and I keep going. Don't move when you talk - causes students to get a bit antsy.

Hope that helps!"
highschoolteachers,"Right after Hurricane Sandy, I was subbing in a class of 3rd graders.  We took some time to talk about the hurricane, what they did as a family, the damage we were seeing (we were in CT, but we got battered pretty good anyway and a lot of people didn't have power and lost trees and stuff).  The aid was really impressed that we spent time talking about the storm and the kids really benefited.  A lot of them were really scared and needed an adult who wasn't their parent to tell them it was ok.

For high school kids, I would probably spend less time on the storm.  Just a brief, ""Hey, is everyone ok, are we all here, is there something we need to talk about"" announcement before going on.  Acknowledge the storm happened and it was scary, but reinforce that we have to move on.  And then maybe give them a lighter day to get back into the swing of things.  "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English too. I'm relatively new, so I don't have a ton of resources saved. However, if there's something that you would want, I might have it and can email it to you. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm sorry this happened to you. 

My district is on its third year of piloting math books for high school. We threw out Springboard and Big Ideas because they were too hard and a lot of the resources wouldn't fit into the curriculum or the resources just sucked."
highschoolteachers,"I am also in my third year of teaching.

I suppose I feel somewhat similar to this, but not quite as extreme. I am more in the neighborhood of not being sure this is something I actually want to do for the rest of my life. I like my students, coworkers, and principal, but I just don't feel passionate about what I do. I still try to do the best I can, but I can see myself getting bored with this job doing it day after day. Even doing lessons in a different way doesn't change it up enough for me.

I enjoy what I do on most days, but other days I feel as though I am just going through the motions. I know this is an important job, educating the youth and such, but I don't feel necessarily productive, if that makes any sense. When I tell people how I feel, they always ask me what I would want to do instead, and I feel silly telling them. I wish I would have gone to school for computer programming with a focus on game design. I love video games. It's hands down my biggest hobby when I have free time. Back in high school I never even thought of channeling my love for video games into a job. By the time I realized it was actually something I could go to school for, I was already on my last year for my education degree. I like it, but I would love something else."
highschoolteachers,"Check out Kelly Gallagher's Write Like This. It sounds like these students need more writing in addition to this low reading ability. One thing that he suggests is an Article of the Week. You don't have to do it weekly, but periodic use of interesting articles is way for students to learn about something that is going on the world around them. You also can test different reading comprehension strategies (annotations, quick summaries, skimming once and rereading etc) on the articles to teach the students tips. They can write to respond the articles too. Gallagher's website has articles that he has used for Articles of the Week. NewsELA is another good source. 

Some kind of independent reading project of low-level but high interest YA books would be helpful too even if that means the high school librarian has to borrow some books from the middle school library.

Interactive reader's theater might be a fun way to help with reading fluency if that's an issue. I've had success with Zach Hamby's mythology reader's theater plays. http://www.mythologyteacher.com/

I don't know what your district has in terms of technology, but if you can get computer access for your classes even for a class period or two at a time, Actively Learn is a resource worth checking out. The website hosts different short stories and poems, and the teacher can embed questions and notes into the text. It makes for some good in-text scaffolding. You can also upload your own content to the website to use if you don't see something that you like there, although there is some great content already there from other teachers. 

Do you know any middle school teachers? They may have some ideas too for appropriate literature and strategies."
highschoolteachers,"your content isnt going to save your management. Start with having a similar and reliable class structure order. Do Now, Mini Lesson, Activity, Wrap Up. Then you format the content to that structure. You kind of in a way have to segment things like a tv show, slot a, slot b, and transitions. That keeps students interacting with the content in different and refreshing way. If you show a ted talk for more than 5 minutes, those kids are no longer going to be engaged with the content and Vocabulary cant be an entire day. However you can do all that stuff in one day. Its work but it and it will suck as a first year but then you only have to tweak it and change it in the future. that will all help you plan effectively 

Another thing is something someone else pointed out and that was expectations. You need to make your goal for them public. Your working and uphill battle trying to convince high schoolers you have their best interest in mind. Convince them you do and make the goals you expect to them public. I make it clear we *(use we) will all pass the final required to graduate and ultimately i will all students graduate and i will not give up on a student. everyday they get a shot and i speak to every student at least once a class even if its just checking in. Some days are not great days for individual students but everyday they have the opportunity and the resources and my help with the work. Theyll get tight at you that day for pushing them on a bad day but theyll respect it on good days. be consistent with your expectations. 

Im still kinda new at this too but I teach U.S. and Global in an low income transfer high school and I see the students work harder if youre a strong and consistent leader. also dont miss any days. Dont give up on the job, be proud of it, work hard. Keep working on it because teaching is worth it. Once you get good at it, teaching is a lot of fun

Edit: Block of text was ugly, forgot how to format on reddit because usually only post in r/OWE
"
highschoolteachers,"Have you asked an administrator or Teacher of Record (for your students with an IEP) for some guidance or help? There is no shame in that, especially considering that you have a high number of IEP students and three preps. Maybe the school can reallocate an aide to assist you but sometimes they can be just as much work.

In regards to your class, I'm guessing you have high school? I would suggest breaking your students into groups based upon ability levels. I'd actually focus on reading levels and use the data from whatever screener your school has utilized. Once you have these groups established, you are probably going to have to alter some of them due to behavioral conflicts. Sometimes I would place a lower level student with a higher group to create a peer mentoring dynamic but sometimes, regardless of the students, they are just going to need some extra supervision.

I'd devote some time to reviewing your behavioral expectations. At first start with reviewing them daily and then move them to a periodic review. Make sure to post your expectations in the room.

How have your groups ended badly? When the students work, what are you doing? If you are doing groups, you should be circulating through your classroom, providing individual and small group intervention both academically and behaviorally.

Finally, what kind of devices are available for teachers to use? If there aren't any, I'd discuss applying for grants at your next teacher based or whole staff group meeting. In the interim, grouping makes the best sense to utilize a BYOD policy and having your kids utilize technology. It's one good way to establish group norms by giving them a specific role. Group research would be one. Just make it clear that devices are to be used for research purposes and not personal use during class time. The first and second time this is violated the student should receive a warning, the third time the device should be confiscated provided it falls within line of your school/classroom policy. 
"
highschoolteachers,"Wait a moment...a 15 minute lecture is too much?

There ain't no way that's true especially considering they have to contend with 45 minute to 1 hour lectures in college. I'm not trying to teach to pander to the children that refuse to focus. I have kids with ADHD or that are on the autism spectrum that are able to focus on a 15 minute lecture. In fact, on days that I notice that I'm lecturing (when it's harder material) I am always amazed that they are paying attention and taking notes. I know some students are probably off in their own world, but I'm trying to be honest by saying that they are doomed.

Most college professors don't make an interactive conversation part of their class and they probably don't know how to.

Part of high school is preparing these kids for college. That means teaching them ways of taking notes. Teaching them ways to focus in class. Teaching them to be self-aware of their learning. It's not easy and no one said it was, but out-right refusal to listen is something else altogether."
highschoolteachers,"She was talking to someone while you were teaching?  

Well that's your issue right there.  If it's an average high school class size (~30) it's likely pretty obvious to all present who is listening and who isn't.  Stop the problem where it starts, students not listening.  This is a behavior that needs correcting via seating chart change, stopping instruction to redirect the student(s) in question, etc.  If she brushes it off, then it needs to escalate in an organized and consistent fashion as long as the behavior continues, following your schools disciplinary protocol.

You also mention that some students spend 10-15 minutes of classtime doing nothing.  What is going on doing those minutes? Did they finish their work, or are they distracted from their work?  If the former, then be sure you have plenty of additional activities to keep them going the whole hour.  If the latter, then you need to redirect them. 

Chewing into them is a short-term solution.  It might put the fear of god into them for a day or two, but these issues will start creeping back.  When they do, you need to address them immediately when they happen rather than letting things go for awhile.  For the sake of your own sanity, and for the sake of the students."
highschoolteachers,"HS teacher here...very similar issues. For the beginning of class, that do now type of thing is a procedure. Last year with on particular class I held them outside the door before class, waited for the halls to settle, told them the expectation and gave them a chance. We had to retry 3 times (everyone back out into the hall...). I have also had those entry tasks be mini quizzes. Make it clear on the board about it and that they have x amount of time. Then collect it and move on. 

For the end of class, I find that the ""I dismiss you, not the bell"" type of attitude doesn't work for me. Kids get very defensive and it strains relationahips. Instead, I've also had exit tickets be a quiz. As for the ""I'll do it at home"" attitude, I don't know. You know they largely won't, but I haven't come up with a great way to deal with that. 

In general, I am a fan of just talking it out. Especially for high school. Even with my freshmen, it's a life lesson moment. I called it ""honesty tuesdays"". I gave them a chance to share what's going well, what they like/don't like in class. You've gotta be real up front with them and make sure they know how to be honest yet respectful. Once they have had a chance to share then you can say what you want to about it. Come up with a plan as a class how to deal with it. That way if you need to enforce it, it's their plan. Obviously  you can kinda guide it to where you want, but give them some hand in it.

Sorry if typos; mobile."
highschoolteachers,"In high school--let them talk.

It's somewhat of a reward. If they don't talk while I lecture for 15-20 minutes then the other 50-60 minutes they can work and talk. If someone talks during lecture I can get their attention and ask ""Do we need to work silently for the rest of class?"" and they usually stop. "
highschoolteachers,There are no high school history jobs (MA). My school just rejected a dozen history students teachers because there is nowhere to place them and there will be no jobs for them once they're done. Be prepared to end up teaching an adjacent subject like English or Psychology. 
highschoolteachers,Look into Project Lead The Way (PLTW).  It's a national engineering program that is very hands on.  Schools around you may already have this program.  I am currently starting the program at my high school and loving it. It's a nice change from teaching science all day.  We even do competitive robotics through VEX.  Kids love this program.  
highschoolteachers,"My pay rocks, my hours don't suck and I spend very little of my own money.  *AND*, social studies is not tested by the state at the high school level, so I don't even have to worry about that!  A lot of that depends on where you teach."
highschoolteachers,"I left after 12 years of high school to go to seminary.  Spent 10 years out of education working as a minister in churches.  In 2010, I left to go back into teaching.  Not hard to come back.  Teaching stays about the same.  Had to learn new curriculum, but I do MS, so it was not difficult.  My goal now is to retire in 7ish years and start a new career related to my divinity degree. (chaplain)  Best advice I can give is go with your heart.  Life is too short."
highschoolteachers,"What's the grade level? If they're in high school, and they can handle it; then there should be nothing wrong with idle chit-chat while they work. However, grade 5-8 might be a different story, as they could be testing their limits now, and it's a situation that could get out of hand at some point. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach eighth-grade English, so obviously are contents and ages are little bit different, but I've taught high school and I was intimidated by group work initially. What I realized is that it can be intimidating to relinquish control, but it can help many students. 

You could have partner discussions where you put a question on the board and have students discuss it with a partner. During that time, you circulate around the room and listen to the kids. When you bring the whole class back together, you do one of two things. First, you say something like, ""I heard many of you saying…"" or you call on someone who you know has the right answer. It's hard to unring a bell. It's a kid gives wrong information, the other kids might remember it, and that comes back to haunt you during test time. Or you could do a think-pair-share if you have more time. 

I like to do something I call musical partners where I will play a song and when the music stops the kids need to find a partner. I then give them a question. (It's not exactly an open ended question, but I found it works better when it's a bit more open ended than one or two words.) After they discuss, you talk about it as a class, and then you move on. They can only work with partners once. With my eighth graders, after about four questions, they are finished.

You could do a carousel activity where you put different questions or worksheets or activities in different parts of the room and the students have to walk around and answer the questions. Sometimes I do this with a short story or novel. I put a few questions in about five places in the room, I put the kids in groups, and then they walk around the room, answer the questions at each station, and then they move to the next one. When we are finished, we discuss this as a class. With my students, this normally takes about two periods. I tell them they can work with their group or they can work by themselves. It's graders have a hard time sitting still all day, so anytime I can get them up and moving, I usually have some success."

What is this, the opening boot camp scene from Full Metal Jacket? If I set up a punishment system like that, I am just *begging* to be lied to. The incentive structure is explicitly set up to reward someone (by revoking punishment) who falsely turns in one of their peers.

I teach high school, so this is an opportunity to tie in game theory with the rights and responsibilities of authority. If it did go down like that, I would probably start by apologizing to the whole class for effectively splintering them against one another. Yes, it was wrong for A to lie, but it was also a poor setup on my part for the reasons mentioned above. My authority is supposed to build class cohesion and teamwork, not dissolve it. Since this is a very effective strategy for people in charge to break unity of a group over whom they have power, have your eyes open if you see anyone else using it against you."
highschoolteachers,"It depends on the age group of the kids. This honestly sounds like something my four-year old pre-k kids do to each other. I get a lot of tattling and pointing of fingers. However, my kids also are still in the developmental stages of understanding the difference between what is truth and what is fiction. Sometimes, the child tattling is the one who committed the crime and often can't remember that they did. Instead, they blame it on someone else. Now, if these are older kids (i.e.: middle, high school aged), they should know better than to point fingers. The way you worded the situation, it sounds as though the teacher just went off Student A's word. Now student A will have that little bit of an edge. If I was the teacher in that hypothetical class, I would have not taken student A's word right away, but rather talked to both A and B privately. So on your scale, student A would be in trouble at about a 3. No serious consequences would occur. But I also would not let it go without saying anything. Deal with it then and there: Conflict Resolution. "
highschoolteachers,"I sub mainly high school, but my go-to 'trick' is to always greet the students at the door. Make eye contact and say 'Good Morning!'. It really works wonderfully toward creating a positive first impression. "
highschoolteachers,"I am the para who runs In-School-Suspension in my high school. While I have teachers in to help me for select periods (and I have a radio to get staff assistance when I need it), I am the only one assigned to the classroom all day, and it does get dramatic from time to time. Most of my kids are very poor and black and I am white and from a middle-class background, so a lot of them pushed me and challenged me at the beginning of the year.

Things aren't perfect yet. I don't know that they will ever be perfect, but I'm starting to pick my battles a little more wisely and I think the students are getting a better idea of what to expect -- and hopefully starting to believe that I really am trying to be fair and to treat them with the same respect that I want from them. 

Last Wednesday was a terrible day school-wide and I got some of the worst of it. I hit the point where I decided I couldn't continue doing what I was doing anymore. Since then, things have changed for the better. Today was another chaotic day -- lots of energy, lots of drama, and a mini-crisis in my room. Got through it, and felt a lot more able to handle it than I did last week. 

I think I might actually survive this year. Though if another para position opens up in a regular classroom I've been assured that it's mine. While I may be able to survive the year in in-school, there are people who would likely do a much better job than I would, and I don't mind handing it over to one of them. 

-- edit -- That said, one of the teachers recommended that I start calling home for kids in In-School. Nope, nope, nope. Not my job. I don't get paid enough to call home to parents. Nor do I have any form of coaching, training, nor request from the principal and vice-principal to do so.  Those two have handled the discipline issues I've passed on to them via write-ups and I am more than happy to continue to leave this duty to them.  "
highschoolteachers,My mom teaches high school. Only recently I realized how hard she works and how much stress shes been through. I'm up for it.
highschoolteachers,"Next week is fall break, my high school students have been trying my patience and had their midterms this week. I made it through and never lost my ""Love and Logic"" and even made some positive breakthroughs with some difficult kids. Imagine my dismay upon picking up my elementary aged stepson this afternoon to hear him nonchalantly mention that his teacher had him stand in the corner every afternoon this week as punishment for something that happened Monday. He's already received the punishment from the school and his mom for that incident so I was really peeved to hear this. Is this common in elementary? I feel like I recall my School Law professor mentioning this as corporal punishment...ugh.../rant"
highschoolteachers,"You are thinking of you and your friends.  Criminal genius go through high school.  The student I posted about was so strange, that after he graduated, I wouldn't Google his name.  He creeped me out."
highschoolteachers,"I moved from a high school to middle school early in my career, and at both very much felt like I was given whichever classes were left. So even though this is only my 3rd year I have taught 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade social studies/history classes."
highschoolteachers,"I mean... why does ""participation"" matter? Like, if the kid is learning academically what they're supposed to learn in the class, why does it matter to you if they've missed a few classes? More to the point - how many students do you *actually* have who will miss a shit ton of class and actually be able to make up the work to above the grade level standard to where they would get an A?

Maybe it's the grades I teach (and the number of kids, which is lower than high school teachers), but I have approximately zero students who will miss a lot of class and be able to make the work up to standard. Their grades come down through their own actions, not through me arbitrarily punishing them through a participation grade. When students are tardy, they are missing work during class time, and if they don't make it up at home, their consequence is detention during which they make up the work. Students can always resubmit work if they are displeased with their grades up until the point at which it is no longer feasible for me to grade due to my own limitations. 

Honestly, switching to standards-based grading has been freeing for me because I circumvent the ""you're giving me this grade because you hate me!"" argument entirely - I point to the rubric, and that's it. Parents don't get mad at me because I don't ding kids for late work. All the onus for proving they have met the standard is turned over to the kid, and all behavior-related things are separate consequences dealt with at the school admin level, at least in my school. If a kid is a smart jerk,  they're a smart jerk, and the jerk part of that will get dealt with separately from the smart part. My relationships with kids are a lot better for it, frankly.

I guess I'd just encourage you to think critically about what you're trying to teach them, and to what end. I think you may be able to do what you're trying to do AND fully embrace standards-based grading."
highschoolteachers,"Congrats! As a high school student, music educators have had such a huge impact on my life! I’m sure you’ll go onto do great things and impact so many lives :)"
highschoolteachers,It’s more helpful to high school students in regards to college planning... but not so much for middle schoolers. The platform is bland. I’ve found it to be mostly a waste of time for 6th and 7th graders.
highschoolteachers,"Strong routines can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.

Here's mine (Title 1 high school juniors).

I greet students at the door. If it's early in the year, I'll remind them every day to check the table by the door.

They come in. They check the table. Any handouts or readings for the day are there. They grab them. Then they grab their class binder. They sit down. There's a warm up on the board. There's a minute or two while people are getting settled in, chatting with their friends. Then I start the timer on the warm up and they have five minutes to write. When times up I have a signal that it's time to transition. Never been a big fan of clapping. I've tried a bunch of things but last year I started using a drum that students clap to in response. A colleague of mine uses a meditation chime. Then we talk about the warm up, first in pairs or as a small group, then as a whole class. 

(Digression. How are your students seated? You want an arrangement that minimizes needing to move desks around for different activities and where you can move around freely and keep an eye on as many students as possible. Mine are in groups of four in a rough square with clear lanes between them. A horseshoe shape where the teacher moves around the inside of the horseshoe is a common one for elementary)

Then, there's some direct instruction on something I need them to learn or preparing them for the upcoming activity. Then straight into the activity.

Notice that there is no time at all from the minute they get into the classroom, where it's unclear exactly what they should be doing, that means if a student is off task it's easy to redirect them because it's a reminder, not a whole explanation.

Get this book also:Fred Jones - Tools for Teaching. Don't treat it as gospel, but it has a lot of good, practical class management stuff."
highschoolteachers,"For the record, people who conduct PD but don't teach, high school kids HATE moving."
highschoolteachers,I'm looking for a good name for a school-wide beginning of the year bonding trip we're doing for our high school students during the first week of school (going to center city Philly for team video challenges and ComedySportz improv). Student-bonding trip is the lame name we have now. Any suggestions? What do you guys call your schools' bonding trips/programs if you have them? Thanks!!
highschoolteachers,"Wow to all the haters here. 

I completely agree! They totally feel like my kids. I teach high school, and I've had the pleasure of moving up with my preps so that I have most students twice, as freshman and again as juniors. This past year was the first time I had the juniors, and it really was neat to see how much they've changed since freshman year. This year, I will have a couple of students for the 3rd time. One of them, in particular, I didn't have last year, but for his freshman and sophomore years, and he came to visit me every day last year. Sometimes more than once a day. Sometimes to help with his next math class, but most of the time just to chat about his other classes and life in general.

I really miss that over the summer and I'm counting down the days until we go back to school (20!)"
highschoolteachers,My high school maths teacher used the smart board in 'whiteboard mode' and saved the notes in case anyone missed class.
highschoolteachers,"Teaching students who are used to having no routine or expectations is awful. Especially because you had spent so much time setting up those expectations with your first group of students. In my experience (about to start my 4th year teaching high school social studies), once you reach the halfway point, everyone starts to get a little tired. It can be hard to set up expectations for this new group of students but maybe try and focus on that for a day or two. I hope the rest of the year improves!"
highschoolteachers,"I spent TWO MONTHS as an elementary teacher in North Carolina before I quit. 

My elementary school was segregated supposedly by ability but surprise surprise, nearly all of the white kids were in the ""honors"" classes along with a token minority while most of the minorities were in the ""regular"" classes along with white kids who were for the most part, special ed students. 

I might have finished the year but the district was cheating me on my pay. Although I had 16 years of experience and a Master's degree, the district made me fill out ""verification"" forms to send to the HR department of my previous employers. I was told that until these verification forms came back, I'd be paid at the rate of a 1st year teacher. 

As I recall, my net income for a 1st year teacher was just under $2000. When I complained to HR, the HR director told me not to worry because I would be retroactively paid. This was easy for her to say because she didn't have to live on a first year teacher's pay and she didn't have to figure out  how to pay for my cost of living expenses on substandard pay ... nor would my creditors have accepted the idea that they would be paid when I got paid.

I put up with this for two months and later quit. By coincidence, I later saw a news expose about how North Carolina was having problems with attracting and retaining teachers because the HR department in many districts was taking far too long to ""verify"" prior employment and many teachers were tired of being chronically underpaid despite district assurances that teachers would retroactively be paid once they were able to verify their employment experience. 

 **Tell me that Education in this Country is Equitable** 

Hah! I now teach Culinary Arts at a rural Title 1 school. Title 1 says it all. I transferred to my current location from a high school in an affluent neighborhood. The boosters at this school provided supplemental funding of several hundred thousand dollars. The kids went on lavish vacations. They wore designer clothes. They had the latest and most expensive gizmos ... smart phones, laptops, tablets etc. In contrast I have kids at my current school who are homeless and/or who take advantage of my school's showers, food bank, and clothing bank. Most of my kids have never been outside the country. Our boosters provide cookies for bake sales to raise money for student athletics. Their efforts have generated a few hundred dollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars that were given to my last school. 

My father came to this country as a penniless immigrant but used our education system and the GI bill to go to college. He eventually became a doctor but it was a hard uphill climb. The rising cost of student debt makes the challenge of a decent post secondary education increasing hard (if not impossible) for many low income students. 

While America is still the land of opportunity, kids who were born with the proverbial silver spoon in their mouths have a distinct advantage over everyone else. Low income kids from Title 1 schools like mine are at a distinct disadvantage.

This BTW is one of my big gripes about NCLB testing. If all kids came to school on a level playing field, then yes, accountability testing would make perfect sense ... but you can't compare public schools in affluent neighborhoods with rural and inner city Title 1 schools. 

Case in point - I'm at a rural Title 1 high school. In Vegas, they have academies for the performing arts, Career and Technical Education, science etc.  Even though my school is part of the Clark County School District, the fact that we're in a rural location means that the kids at my school don't have access to all of the programs offered by the district in the greater Vegas area. 

For the past TEN YEARS, the district has suffered annual budget cuts. I would argue that rural Title 1 schools (or even rural schools in general) feel these budget cuts more acutely than schools in the greater Vegas area. After all, kids in these schools still have access to the academies whereas my school does not.

Over the past ten years, the CTE program has been gutted. I'm the only remaining CTE teacher on campus. We've lost automotive, wood shop, and business. We've also lost a Spanish teacher, a 2nd security monitor, a librarian, and the cafeteria manager lost her entire adult staff and now has to make do with student helpers. 

This year we're facing $38,000 in budget cuts for my school. Where t his money will come from is anyone's guess. I'm thinking that we'll probably lose another aide. 

Each  year my school is expected to do more with less. I don't think this is fair given our rural location. (sigh)"
highschoolteachers,"Passion is important, for sure. But realistically, not every kid needs to find your content interesting. They need to find it *worthy of their time.* There are plenty of students I teach who despise English, but who are also determined to do well because of their other goals: graduation with honors, college admissions, understanding the news and conversations around them, being informed voters, fighting with people online, whatever it is. 

You are correct in that students have a responsibility to be accountable for their actions and their education. However, even in high school, their brains aren’t fully developed. It sounds like you were a mature student (at least in the class you mentioned), and were able to prioritize the lessons there— but many of them are not able to do this yet. 

There’s a middle ground, for sure. I tell students I’m not a police officer or a babysitter... but there’s no way in hell I would let them leave the room or skip class. This is a liability, for starters. Attendance records can be used in court— I’ve known several teachers who have had to bring records to testify in truancy cases, educational neglect cases, etc. Don’t get caught falsifying records. Allowing them to leave or not even show up tells them that your class isn’t important— you’re letting them off the hook, which definitely doesn’t teach them the accountability piece you’re looking for. 

Personally, I believe in natural consequences. Students who aren’t prepared don’t often get second chances, but students who make an effort and fail do. Other students see this and choose to change their behavior. Not every student, and not every time, but it does have an effect. As far as Johnny, who has checked out and sleeps in the corner, is concerned? Every day, I invite him to join the class. I give him the same class materials I give to everyone else. I give him the same opportunities. Sometimes, that’s the kid who needs to know you haven’t given up on them. Students inherently want to do well but have been conditioned, for one reason or another, to not believe they are capable, to not believe it’s worth it, etc. Praise participation and effort without feeling punitive. “Johnny, great job today. You really know your stuff” instead of “wow, thanks for finally joining us today, Johnny! It’s nice to see your eyes open for once!” 

I think you can have high expectations for students and expect them to meet you halfway in terms of accountability and responsibility, but just remember that you are the adult in the room, and you have to model the behaviors you want: showing up for things you’re not excited about (PD, etc.), being prepared, and being accountable."
highschoolteachers,"Yep. I teach high school and they’re all my kids. They’re every other teacher’s kids also, but there my kids.

I told one class this last year, and one said, “Wow. Call we call you ‘Dad’?” I said, “Absolutely not.”

They give me little cards and notes thanking me for being their teacher. I keep every one."
highschoolteachers,"Been teaching almost 20 years, the majority of them at charter schools. Some of my best years were at charter schools, good friends and my best students, but charters really do suck the life out of you.  

I'll be starting at a new school this year, a large comprehensive high school that has a strong union, so that should be a relief. 

I have often found myself in a situation in which I work so much that I don't know what to do when I'm not working so I keep working. 

I still like the classroom, but I'm also ready to move on to a non-teaching role or teach online."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school teacher, it is amazingly gratifying to see them come to you as children and watch them grow into adults. It was wonderful when I graduated and eventually became friends with some of my teachers; it is even so much more wonderful to have those special few of them go from being your kids to turning into your friends as adults."
highschoolteachers,"Hi! Sorry you are feeling anxiety. I've got just under 30 years in the game..middle school and high school. I can offer you some of my habits and a few observations:

Habits: 1.) I nearly always greet my students at the door (Hi, fist bump,whatever). It goes towards establishing a bond with your kids 2.) I say good morning/afternoon to my class when they're seated and start with the news headlines as a warm up (I use Democracy Now, you could use CNN student news). That's 10 minutes you can use to take attendance/ review what you're doing or just catch a breath 3.) I speak to them as I speak to most any other adult

You haven't mentioned what you teach or the level, but regardless I would add this: truthfully, teaching is one of the most underestimated, misunderstood and underappreciated professions. Period. It isn't easy. I get to work at 6am every morning and either do paperwork or refine upcoming lessons. I constantly am assessing my lessons and refining or even trashing old material that isn't working for me/my kids any more. 

That said, it does get easier. I have years of material to draw on from creating stuff over a few decades. I have learned lessons about how to work with my kids from trial and error (be fair, be consistent, speak to them as you would be spoken to)

As an immediate observation that hopefully should put things into perspective: your students are just as anxious as you. Always. The first couple weeks is hectic for all: you and them. Roll with the punches. Be you. You are a teacher and the kids will see you that way until you cede that role. 

Feel free to message me anytime to vent or bounce stuff off me. Best of luck my friend 😉"
highschoolteachers,"Research restorative practices. They focus heavily on building relationships and community, and then repairing harm when it occurs. I'm a high school teacher and I've had great success with circles! I did them twice a week and they only ever took about 15 minutes. You can use circles for teaching too, so the kids get the idea that circles are the way we ""conduct business"" in the classroom, not just a weird thing to be resistant to."
highschoolteachers,My high school i graduated from had an escape room for the teachers today! I was insanely jealous! Go karting sounds fun!!
highschoolteachers,"A lot of the middle school and high school buildings in my district are like, 100+ years old so all of us especially those with exterior classrooms, really dread the first month or so of school where the A/C is inconsistent at best. Oklahoma Augusts suck. 

That said, I've never really felt a desire to wear shorts to work. I'll wear dresses, sure, but that's my style in general anyway. I know there are such a thing as ""dress shorts"" (whatever) but I just don't like them."
highschoolteachers,"I feel the same way! I teach high school, and they all feel like mine, in a goofy family sort of way. Some of them call me grandma, even though I just turned 30, but it’s in a loving sort of way. I can’t wait to see them all again soon!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school and I do have two kids that are mine biologically, and I also get this way. 

I have a class this fall that will be mostly kids I already know from last year. I was just thinking today about how much I miss them and how I can’t wait to see them in a couple of weeks for picture day. I also frequently check up on former students on social media just to see how they’re doing. 

I love all my “kids,” even the ones I didn’t give birth to."
highschoolteachers,"Out of Florida?


I know you said high school but if you have a high EL population or high population of reluctant readers, maybe something like the You Wouldn't Want To Be series or Horrible Histories? They're definitely for a younger audience (8-12, I think?) but that can also make them less stressful for students who struggle."
highschoolteachers,"It's not maternal in that we feel we birthed them or have a biological relation.  It's that we form incredibly close relationships and early childhood bonds are just different. 
 

For example, we're not only allowed to physically touch our kids but holding, rocking, carrying, putting to sleep, etc. is part of our job.  We potty train.  We teach them to eat, to tie their shoes.  We're there for those first steps, the first shaky name write, to kiss the boo boos better, etc.  We become their secure attachment that young children need when they are away from home.  We aren't raising children in the technical sense, but in many other ways we certainly do.    

No one thinks they are replacing or becoming a surrogate parent, but in a grade where relationships are *everything* there is a level of caring that goes beyond, say, a high school chem lab relationship."
highschoolteachers,Help For Billy by Heather Forbes has a lot that can be applied to high school ages
highschoolteachers,"Its absolutely not, and I think acknowledging this disparity makes us better teachers and we should actively teach students who have better means the importance of perspectives outside of their own. 

I went to the biggest high school in my county (I now work at a very large and well respected middle school) my high school had over 20 buildings and amazing extra curriculars and a library that would put the one in Alexandria to shame. Because of the name of my high school ( a local well respected businessman who founded a southeastern grocery chain) we got thousands more in support than the other schools. 

Its unfair and its awful. And we are ripping the futures out of our less advantaged students. I don't know the answer but I pledge to be part of the solution and it starts in the hearts of the students we ***do*** teach"
highschoolteachers,The first rule of high school is you don't talk about fight club.
highschoolteachers,"I was brought to tears last summer, sitting around the table on vacation with my friends and their high school age children. I teach high school. All of our schools are within 20 minutes of each other, and they are all the free public high schools in our respective towns.

I honestly thought my school was pretty darn average. Maybe on the lower end of average, but nothing to complain about. I was pretty positive and upbeat for the most part.

And then...

All of my friends’ kids have free devices issued to them as freshmen, open Wi-Fi, classes averaging around 20 students, most of their texts are digital, and the classes they were describing… Poetry, criminal justice, creative writing. Those still exist? They’re normal?!? 

I mean.... my school has exactly none of that. We have mold and mice, classes averaging around 30, no Wi-Fi even for the staff, just… nothing. One time in 12 years we were allowed to order up to $50 worth of supplies for our classrooms. We are provided with lined paper, staples, and maybe pencils if they’re available. (Ok, I always knew the supply thing was garbage…)

This year I am teaching two sections of a co-taught English class. There will be 25 kids, 10 of them will be special Ed, and I will get no training on this or collaborative planning time with my co-teacher, who will often be pulled away to do tests and attend IEP meetings. Those 50 kids are being done a tremendous disservice. 

What is happening?"
highschoolteachers,I teach high school and there are a handful of kids each year that I absolutely need to know are doing okay. They’re my kiddos. And I have kids of my own but I also would lay down my life for the others.
highschoolteachers,"I swore I'd never do middle school either, until my district decided otherwise.

You get to use sarcasm and have it not go over their heads! You'll learn quickly to have a good poker face.... and if you're short, like me, you may not be able to see over the students' heads,  unless you're in the 6th grade hallway.

6th graders - are still so young! They are capable, but still need the guidance transitioning from elementary into middle school. (Ie: organization, multiple teachers, homework, etc) Give them lots of grace through this transition. 

7th graders - honestly, not sure why, but they are the ones who make me laugh the most. They know the ins and outs of middle school and they seem to just want to be 8th graders. They also seem to push buttons a bit more.  I think they're my favorite grade though. 

8th graders - just want to be high schoolers already. They know it all which causes a lot of palm to face moments for them and their teachers.  After 3 years with them you really have some great connections.

I miss the littles, but being able to plan the same lessons for multiple classes.... that's pretty awesome..... now grading 150+ papers on the same topic... not so much.

Enjoy!"
highschoolteachers,"I’m a high school teacher at heart but there is a lot to love about middle school. They’re more big kids than little teenagers in a lot of ways. They are so fun and way less inhibited than high schoolers. But they require a lot of energy. The last time I taught middle school I also had a toddler at home, and a friend with both toddlers and teens of her own. We’d play a game every day called “toddler or teen?” where we’d share stories from our day and the other would guess if a toddler or teen did it. Doesn’t really work with my high schoolers, they’re too cool for school!"
highschoolteachers,"Just curious, have any documentaries been done that highlight this difference? Would love to see one go really big that can help educate the general population who may not quite realize how bad it is.

WV legislators recently passed a law allowing public charter schools in a state that is already floundering. We went on strike and protested because of it, killed the bill during our legislative session, but then they passed it during a special session right at the beginning of summer when we couldn’t strike. They sold the idea of charter schools to the public by claiming it will help our test scores go up, but the reality is our test scores are low in backwoods counties that have high opioid addicted populations and unqualified teachers (because no one with a college degree wants to live in these towns and get paid squat) and the charter schools are going to go to the wealthy counties with high test scores and qualified teachers. The discrepancy in money funneled into schools in the various counties is why our state test scores are overall very low, but yeah let’s slap a bandaid on a bullet hole and introduce fucking charter schools that will take funding from our already underfunded public schools.

Side note: we had flooding a few years ago that ruined several school buildings that never got rebuilt. I know of at least one high school that is still operating out of an elementary school. Nothing says “your education means nothing to us” like making 18 year olds piss in toilets that are a foot off the floor."
highschoolteachers,"I also want to know more -- same boat, high school where pretty much every student has experienced at least one traumatic event, most many more than one. 

A few of us became trained in tier 1 circles (which can also be done in an academic way -- I'm working on planning one for historical position taking to build an understanding/empathy for different historical groups) but we also struggle with the specifics. Behavior is not pretty in our building."
highschoolteachers,"Logically, yes, I think it’s strange to be asked to be “less Catholic” at a Catholic school. I was a cradle Catholic and watching my friends in high school turn in late notes for “dentist’s appointments” on Holy Days was annoying because the rest of us still had to sit through Mass. I was never bothered by required volunteer hours because it counted toward my Florida Bright Futures requirement and uniforms didn’t really bother me because I was lazy with fashion.

However, I will say that attending Catholic school is the main reason that I am staunchly not Catholic anymore. I can point to the man who was my sophomore/senior religion teacher for that one. The dude was like, fundie-level Catholic, not just Catholic. He was going to raise his kids saying that Santa Claus and the Easter bunny were fake because it would be sinful to lie to them. Yeah...he was a little odd. But even besides those weird things, his Catholicism came through in class in ways that were just plain wrong. In a lesson about original sin, he told our class once that Jewish people in the Holocaust deserved to die because of their sin, just like we all deserve. It was so fucked up because he didn’t retract his statement or clarify when we told him how it sounded. That’s where I think Catholic schools can go very wrong. They say that the best way to make sure your kid doesn’t end up Catholic is to send them to a Catholic school. For myself and quite a few of my friends, that ended up being the case. Not saying that you’re a crazy Catholic or pushy, but I think it’s important to take your students and parents into consideration when assessing the Catholic curriculum."
highschoolteachers,"Keep it simple. 

Cover bulletin boards with paper or fabric or tablecloths. Use borders. 

Arrange desks in rows or groups or mostly groups with a front row or a big U or however you teach best. 

In high school you don’t need a ton more. Put your desk to one side in the front. Keep your spare paper and office supplies in there. Have places for students to turn in work and access handouts/ other needed materials. 

Maybe a few posters or knick knacks but don’t overdo it."
highschoolteachers,"I work in a high school, and some of my former students are in their thirties and have children of their own, and I still call them my kids."
highschoolteachers,"Is this your first year at the school?  Are you hearing these things through the administration?

I went to a Roman Catholic high school. There are a range of attitudes among Roman Catholics, and yes, plenty of Catholic parents might be worried not so much you are ""too religious"", but too ""anti-birth control"" or too ""women must stay at home"", to ""Mel Gibson"" or any number of other things. (Yes, the church view on birth control is anti, but plenty of Roman Catholics aren't anti-birth control.)

Parents who might see you as extreme (assuming they do) would still be just as Catholic as you are and can't be no more be blamed for preferring their interpretation of Catholicism be taught that you can be blamed for wanting to teach your version.

 Since Parents are choosing this school, they have every right to air their views.  Parents certainly *did* air their views at my high school; occasionally teachers were let go because a sufficient number of parents felt they were either not effective teachers or not good examples. The teachers own view on this might have differed, but this happens in private schools.

Of course, the school does get to decide their own rules (and live with whatever the consequences of this are, whether good or bad).  If they have rules, no ones blood need boil when a parent asks the rule be set aside. The answer can just be ""no"".  The parent can then decide whether their kid stays in this school or leaves. This is pretty simple, and an option that does not exist for public schools.

Out of curiosity, is the school granting these requests? Mine did-- for those kids whose parents were not Catholic. We had some Buddist kids at the school; they weren't required to attend mass."
highschoolteachers,"Yes, right after 9/11. Two parents in our district died, as well as a few relatives of faculty, and there was a memorial assembly at the high school. I was also not the only faculty member to cry."
highschoolteachers,"My high school principal was such an emotional person. As a teen it was kind of annoying how choked up he could get (especially at senior convocation where two words into a poem he'd burst into tears) but now I really appreciate the humility and passion he had for the students. 

I've personally never cried infront of a student though"
highschoolteachers,A high school ELA teacher here — and you’re absolutely on the money. Thank you!
highschoolteachers,"Someone else commented the same thing and it sounds like very solid advice. 

My only issue: from what I’ve gathered, in order to teach a high school level subject in a public school in NJ, you must be certified in that subject. In order to be certified in a particular subject, you must complete 30 college credits in that subject, 12 of which must be 300-400 level.

My bachelors degree puts me the closest to having enough biology credits (I’m still about 12 short), hence why I’m pursuing that certification. 
If I were to go for my chemistry or physics certification, that would require me to take a tonnnn of classes to complete the 30 credits in either subject (I literally took 1 chem class in undergrad and that’s it). 

The biology certification states that you are allowed to teach biology (which includes botany, zoology, A+P), environmental science and “general science”.
So it sounds like it’s a little more versatile than just biology.
Again, this is just what I’ve gathered - please correct me if I’m wrong with any of this."
highschoolteachers,"Yes. I teach high school. I’ve cried while reading out loud (really sad moments) and out of frustration a few times, like when a student said some awful things to me and then walked out and slammed the door. I don’t think it’s ever hurt me with the kids — it makes me seem more human. I also explain why I am upset when I am frustrated-crying, and I think that really helps the kids understand how their behavior can affect other people."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for replying !

Yes, I’m hoping it won’t be terriblyyyy difficult to find a job being that in NJ, there is a scarcity of science (all subjects) and math teachers.

So, unless I’m totally wrong, it looks like in order to teach a high school level science class, you have to be certified in that subject (at least in public schools). And in order to be certified in any given subject, you must complete at least 30 credits in that subject with 12 of those credits being 300-400 level. 

I’m open to teaching other science subjects - my preference is just to teach at the high school level. And honestly, I’m just closest to being able to complete my biology certification, given my bachelors degree. 
The NJ Depart. of Education website says that having the biology certification allows you to teach biology (which includes botany, zoology, A+P), environmental science, and “general science”. Maybe there is some versatility there ? 

So your advice is to work as a nurse while pursuing a masters in education program ? 

Hm I didn’t realize alt. route put you in a position of teaching and then taking classes on nights and weekends."
highschoolteachers,"I taught with a gentleman that retired after 20 years of service in the military. It was his first year teaching and he was with 7th grade. He said in all his years with the military he had never been as tired as he was at the end of the day teaching middle schoolers. He transferred to the high school the following year.

So my suggestion is avoid middle school!!!!"
highschoolteachers,"Congratulations and welcome to middle school! I love teaching this age group. They are a lot of fun, excited about learning, and you get to see SO much growth from them in the 3 years they're with us. Plus you'll have lots of funny stories and get great reactions whenever you tell someone what your job is ;) 

One thing I always have to remind myself of is to not underestimate how much they need to learn and practice about how to ""do school"". I have to make sure that I'm really clear and specific with instructions and that I take time to teach and reteach procedures and expectations with them. During conferences/at open house, I tell parents that one of the biggest lessons kids learn in middle school is how to be more independent and how to advocate for themselves.

I always say that middle schoolers can sometimes be like elementary schoolers who think they're high schoolers. They're still young and emotionally immature in a lot of ways, but they really want to be ""big kids"" and have more freedom. As a result, they love to argue, so my biggest go-to strategy when I'm dealing with issues with students is to offer choices and walk away. They're empowered to make a choice, and I avoid a power struggle."
highschoolteachers,"Sure.  I think PBIS is basically just plain good *elementary school* practice, but *NOT* high school."
highschoolteachers,"I took a contemporary issues class my senior year of high school! It was a lot of fun. Our only ""assigned reading"" was a weekly news magazine called, appropriately, The Week. I really recommend it, because it makes an effort to cover not just what happens but also what various parties are saying about it, all in a pretty short and easy to digest package. As far as grades, she made us take weekly quizzes on The Week to make sure we were keeping up. She also had ""news briefings"" assignments, where once every two weeks or so she would just assign us each a story to research and write up a two-page summary on and report it the next class. And, of course, two big semester papers (like around 8-10 pages) covering a current issue of our choice."
highschoolteachers,"OP, I start prepping the day before school starts for staff. 

I have the luxury of being in the same building, classroom, and teaching the same (high school) curriculum as the past two years, so it’s not a question of knowing the material or having enough to do. It’s just that I know that once the school year starts, it’s going to be nonstop anxiety and stress, and I’m not willing to sacrifice even a day of summer to take that mental burden on early. 

It also helps that I know I’m going to be sitting in  meetings for about 14 hours those first two days, and I can mentally prepare and make lists and jot down everything I want to get done before the kids show up. 

Whether you are a teacher who spends their entire summer working on the classroom, or you roll in the first morning wondering what the hell happened to summer, you’re going to do a great job. If you are on here posting about it, you’re already probably a very good teacher. Relax, enjoy planning your wedding, and worry about school when it happens."
highschoolteachers,"I am a vet who just finished my History Credential And student teaching in CA.  People are right in saying it is competitive to find a job.  Teachers teach history until they are part of history... but baby boomers will be retiring and jobs will open.  I am on the job hunt and looks like I will be subbing for the first year to try and make some connections so my resume can get looked at.

Good news, your Post 9/11 GI Bill is awesome.  Mine paid for my undergrad and credential school and I received BAH while doing it.  

Other good news, what you struggled with in high school might not matter.  I almost didn’t graduate high school, was an 11B while active, and became a good student in college to graduate with a 3.7gpa.  Don’t let past struggles define your future potential.  You gained skills in the military like perseverance and work ethic, put them to use.

Most districts in CA have a pay scale just like the military.  Instead of rank/years it’s based on education/years.  You should be able to look online for specific districts pay scales and I imagine most states post theirs.  

Speaking of pay, do you know where you want to live after the military?  Teachers are not always paid decently some places so do your research.  You could spend a lot of time, money, and your GI Bill to teach in an area where the pay isn’t enough to live on.  Do your research.

Are you active duty still or are you out yet?  If you are active duty head to your base’s Ed center and try to get info on CLEP courses.  As much credit as you can get knocked out now will be a benefit to you because it will save you GI Bill time that can be used for a masters later.

Good luck brother.  PM me if you have any questions."
highschoolteachers,"Can confirm that there truly aren’t state guidelines in VA regarding tattoos/piercings. And that it does vary from school to school. I’ve seen math teachers with full sleeves at one of the “nicer” high schools in my area. I’d see if the school districts you’re interested in have an employee handbook and go from there. 

I have a bright tattoo on the back of my neck and just cut my hair short, not realizing the bottom bit of it is visible unless I wear a collared shirt. My plan is to grow my hair out a bit, but also just kind of feel out the school I’ll be at this year. It’s not realistic that I wear a collared shirt everyday, so hopefully I’ll be okay!"
highschoolteachers,"Does anyone ever challenge this? I always wonder why administration does not view films as a valid form of text. Are there teachers out there who are just showing movies and not incorporating relevant work? 

I really think that there are many films that people should see or at least be aware of.

There’s even a high school literacy standard about comparing and contrasting text to film."
highschoolteachers,"My retort to this statement is I need a concrete example of how I had or have any head start.  The place I grew up in (rural KY) is more or less a breading ground for meth heads and opioid addictions.  My parents did the best they could but neither graduated from high school.  I grew up in poverty.  I had to work 40-50 a week waiting tables and bar tending as an undergrad just to pay my tuition.  I reject your premise that just because I’m a white male, I started in front of anyone.  

Come on man, if you’re in this sub, you’re an educated person.  Painting with a brush that broad isn’t wise.  You gotta know that!"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a male teacher who did a year in elementary school, now have moved back to high school.

Working in an elementary school was a bit of culture shock, for me. Ways of communicating, classroom management styles, just the vibe in the break room, all felt very ""female"". It's hard to explain, but I just didn't feel like I fit. There was a lot of talk and ""collaboration"", but I felt like no one was willing to make decisions or take action. At times it felt pretty cliquey and gossipy. I found myself having to read into the subtext of what people did and said to find what they really were trying to communicate.  Which is exhausting for me, personally.

I cannot do the ersatz positivity thing all day... but that was the general expectation. I just want to act like a normal person. Not a clown person.

I was bothered by lack of clear disciplinary procedures... everyone seemed to believe that all problems could be solved with a heart-to-heart... Some boys don't want that and don't respond well to it.

Everyone's rooms were cutesy, while I preferred a more Spartan, utilitarian environment. I didn't spend instructional time making cute decorations for the bulletin board.... I don't know, just my experience, your mileage may vary."
highschoolteachers,"As others on this thread have said, not all Asian families come from money. It is somewhat of a stereotype given that Asia is composed of 48 different countries - the socioeconomic situations of Asians and the country they immigrated from varies. Some Asians from certain countries immigrated to the United States earlier and have had the opportunity to build generational wealth. Some Asians from other countries have immigrated to the United States in more recent times and thus do struggle financially as they work towards making it in their new home.  Many Asian students who are currently in high school or college are the first in their family to be born in the United States of America, as well as educated in the United States of America. It doesn't help that popular media further spreads this stereotype through the form of movies or television characters.

While there are some Asian families who are in a higher income bracket, there are many families that are working class and are barely making ends meet. However, they make it work by living frugally and ensuring that they have some money to help educate their children and help them succeed in school (more in my post discussing this). I lived in a basement for the first 16 years of my life because that's all my parents could afford to live in New York City and that was all they can afford to ensure we went to school in a supportive school district. Many of my friends who have parents that immigrated from Asian countries had an intrinsic motivation to do well in school because we saw education as our key to socioeconomic mobility.

I believe the values that Asian cultures hold towards education aren't just unique to them. These values are present in many families from all different countries. Just as immigrant parents who work hard and spend whatever little money that have towards the betterment of their children is present in every culture. 

While there are Asian families that do spend money on tutoring and prep. resources, it isn't necessary that these are families that come from money. Personally, my family and the family of many of my friends are working class and have struggled financially - however, our parents never had the opportunity to complete their education and they wanted to ensure that we were given every opportunity to be educated ourselves and to succeed in academics. There is a lot of sacrifices that our families made and a lot of wants they forgo to support the needs of their children and family. 

I just wanted to write this to provide more insight and perspective regarding this matter."
highschoolteachers,"Wow.  You’re one of those people.  So my intellect has nothing to do with my success.  The number of sleepless nights studying after working a full time job to pay my tuition has nothing to do with it?  Please explain how growing up in rural Kentucky with parents that didn’t even graduate high school afford me “privilege”.  Your assertion is frankly insulting and doesn’t account years / decades of hard work.  

My choice to study the field I did had nothing to do with privilege either.  I was a research biochemist before I earned my teaching degree.  I have always had an interest in the physical sciences.  I teach because I enjoy the profession!  My experience is that top notch teachers in all fields have the pick of jobs."
highschoolteachers,"Ugh, I hate token/reward systems. I worked at a PBIS school where the top prize was lunch with the principal. Really!? The middle and high school students hated getting the reward slips."
highschoolteachers,"We have to use it because we're a charter school (admin's words). It is really difficult at the high school level because it seems to be geared towards younger kids, like you said. We have tickets we can give out, which I think I might use as homework passes or something of the sort as a bigger incentive. 

Tldr: I feel ya"
highschoolteachers,"In Ohio, most of the hiring happens between April-June, in cascades, as one person moves to a new position, their old position opens and so on. 

As well, for returning teachers, everyone signs a provisional contract at the end of the school year (some people don’t, if their place is awful and they can’t take it anymore, but most sign so they at least have a job), but you have until July 10 to reneg without consequences. After that, there are mild penalties that seem to keep people from moving much (although they still do).

It also depends on the certification. We had a high school math opening last spring (a retirement) and we got 25 applicants with the right credentials. We ended up interviewing 6 for a first round and bringing back 3 for a second round (although one of them bowed out last minute). 

I was hired in math a few years ago in mid-July because of a last minute departure. They only had 3 applicants at that time because everyone else was already under contract. It worked out great for me"
highschoolteachers,"I guess it really depends how short the shorts are. My school is pretty lax. I saw a teacher wearing short shorts, though, and couldn’t believe my eyes. That’s definitely not ok (I work in a high school, though it’s really not ok at any grade level)."
highschoolteachers,"I’ve only ever worn shorts on special days (day before spring break and last day of school) - maybe twice. Feels weird having my legs out at school- but in high school I always wore long pants to school too. I usually go for knee length dresses to keep cool and feel comfortable, but I always wear tights or nylons underneath so my legs feel covered. It feels weird to me to have them put. Not sure why. I’ve never thought about that being different for men. This isn’t helpful, sorry, but good luck!"
highschoolteachers,Our last day is the last working day in June (students are done a week-ish before that in high school) and we’re back the day after Labour Day.
highschoolteachers,"I am an Asian American. My parents immigrated from India to the United States. They never graduated from high school. We are a working-class family who lived in New York City for the majority of my life. I am the first person in my family to graduate from high school (public school) and college (public university - graduated with Honors in Applied Mathematics, as well as Honors in Secondary Education). I graduated debt-free as my tuition was covered by grants. I worked two jobs throughout college to help with household expenses.

My sister will be graduating from high school this coming school year. She will receive her CNA certificate as she is in the health program at her high school. She plans on pursuing nursing.

My parents never put the stereotypical pressure of school and being perfect students (not saying it doesn't occur, but it definitely doesn't occur in every Asian household). There was always an unspoken message and understanding with our parents on the importance of education and academics. We understood that education is to be respected and that is an opportunity that is valuable, especially since my parents never had that opportunity themselves. While my parents never pushed us to our limit in school or pushed us towards any specific career path, we knew that doing well in school was important and that was also important to use our time in school wisely. 

Contrary to popular belief, not all Asians are rich. I am not discounting the fact that there exist high-income Asian families, but there are Asian families who are working-class families - many of whom are relatively new to this country generationally (i.e. many Asian high school and college students are the first in their family to be born Americans). My parents worked labor jobs and we lived frugally. We didn't eat out, we didn't go on vacations, we didn't buy many toys or clothes. We just got the necessities; my parents always made sure they saved some money for our education (i.e. supplies, extra help/tuition, prep. books). 

Furthermore, we grew up holding responsibilities towards household: as younger children doing chores around the house and maintaining an orderly home; as older young adults working jobs and bring in money to help with household expenses. It is common in Indian culture for children to live in their parents home, but everyone in the household contributes to the financial obligations and maintenance of the home. Additionally, in Indian culture, multiple generations live in one household. As children grow older and gain a sense of their responsibility and role towards their family, this sometimes does lead to children working hard in their education to ensure that they can provide for their family (my motivation for doing well in school was to ensure that I can help my family move up in our socioeconomic status).

In summary, a sense of strong family ties and having a sense of responsibility towards the family motivates many Asian children to work hard in school - they want to ensure they can provide and help their family and parents just as their family and parents helped them. Additionally, a strong emphasis on respect towards education also leads to students valuing their education as it is sometimes an opportunity their parents didn't have.

Just to be clear, this is my experience as an Asian child as well as that of many of my Asian friends and family, specifically as an Asian of Indian descent. This may not be representative of all Asian families and cultures."
highschoolteachers,"I am Asian American (Indian). My parents immigrated from India to America before I was born. They never finished high school. I am the first in my family to graduated from high school and college (graduated with honors in Applied Mathematics as well as with honors in Education), debt free because I went to public university that was covered by grants. I worked two jobs and saved money all 4 years.

My younger sister will be graduating this school year from high school with a CNA license. She plans on pursuing nursing.

My parents never pressured us so much in academics as the stereotype typically portrays. But they did hold a high regard for academics and education. While they never pushed us to our limit or to a particular career path, we were always aware that school is important. They raised us to respect this privilege and take advantage of the opportunity they never had. Most importantly, we lived frugally as we are a working class family. But they always made sure that they had some money saved for our education (supplies, tutoring/extra help, prep. books).

They taught us work ethic by having us be responsible for household duties and then later having us work to help cover the expenses in the household. At least in India, children live with their parents but in my household we pay expenses and contribute to maintaining an orderly and clean household. All this to help us become responsible adults.

I think it is a cultural thing. For me it was an emotional thing as well. We are a working class family as are many other Asian American families (there is a stereotype going around that Asians are loaded, and while some of us are, a lot of us are still relatively new generation wise to the country). I wanted to help move our family out of the financial troubles we face living in a high cost of living city.

In summary, Asian culture puts a lot of respect towards education. There is a strong family aspect as multiple generations live in one household, leading to children recognizing their responsibility and role in the family - which in turn sometimes leads to children working hard to obtain an education to further support their family.

To be clear, this is just my perspective as an Indian (South Asian)."
highschoolteachers,Bless you high school English teachers. I totally understand how you would have to take work home. Over 100 essays is no joke.
highschoolteachers,"You might have a good idea there about it affecting younger teachers more. I don't know how old the OP is, I'm in my late twenties and teach high school. To me the parents are still older than I am, so I don't feel like their peer quite yet. It would make sense to me that the disparity might lead me to feel more anxious about my interactions with parents."
highschoolteachers,"As a high school English teacher, I, unfortunately don't feel it's possible for me to not bring work home, but I agree with everything you're saying. It needs to be said!"
highschoolteachers,The kids are usually so much better than the parents. And high school parents are usually much less stressful than elementary and high school kids have a sense of wanting their own privacy so are more likely to respect yours.
highschoolteachers,"Not every kid is college ready out of high school even if tests and admissions say they are. Kids need to be disciplined enough to use the freedom of being an adult responsibly to succeed at college. A lot of kids going to college do it because they are told to do it but don't have motivation or a realistic plan. Once they are there and no one is making them go to class every day or do homework it's easy to fail. If they want to party, do drugs and drink instead of study it is easy to find like minded people at college."
highschoolteachers,"My high school was the same way. I don’t think there was any kind of student work up anywhere? Yet that is an observation expectation for my current school. (I guess what I meant by decorating my room is putting up a few posters and some figures rather than color coordinating everything in my room and everything being pretty.)

Elementary is I feel where a lot of the Pinterest stuff just manifests? And I too would be overwhelmed."
highschoolteachers,"A colleague of mine at my last school kept a baseball bat in her cabinet. I straight up talked to my students about what we would do (high school freshmen and seniors): (1) try to barricade the door (jam the handle + pile furniture in front in case the shooter gets the door open — that will at least slow him down); (2) everyone grab something heavy but throwable — a laptop, a textbook, large full water bottles — and we barrage the shooter if he gets in (again, to slow him down and hopefully disorient him...30 laptops flying at you is a lot harder to deal with than 30 people crouched quietly in a corner); (3) physically fight back and try to get the firearm away from the shooter.

Rather than freaking them out, it actually made my students feel better knowing we had a plan. I was sure to preface the conversation by noting how awful it is that we have to even think about this, but also that if the worst were to happen, I want to have talked about it with them before that moment."
highschoolteachers,"One one the problems is a high school diploma is not a high value certification. For employers it's just a check box. Some schools are addressing this by making duel enrollment courses with local community colleges part of the plan for every kid who isn't struggling. 

A lot of people remember high school as a young adult day care where they learned stuff they never used again."
highschoolteachers,"title 1 nyc high school teacher, same stuff. additionally, i've noticed that even the most misbehaved ones know how to act on the street. pretty sure they behave crazy at school sometimes just because they feel safe there --- but on the train that shit is locked down."
highschoolteachers,"Its funny, Im in a pretty small city with three high schools and I teach at the title 1 school. I see my kids all the time, usually as employees of the places I go- cashiers, waiters, delivery drivers, etc. While many of them are pills in class, they are generally super pleasant in public and respectful of my time. The worst I get is a fist bump or a handshake."
highschoolteachers,"My room is a mix between functional and aesthetic/inspiration.

On the front wall, I have all the mandatory posters (behaviour policy, lab safety guidelines, dress code, etc), but they are behind the door so I can refer to them when disciplining a student. Above the whiteboard I have the main command words and their definitions because my students really struggle with writing what the question actually wants. I'll refer to this ""display"" a few times per year per class, especially with my seniors. 
Next to my whiteboard, behind my desk, I have my ""personal corner"". It has my calendar, it has thank you cards from students, it has a photo of my family. It helps the kids realise you're actually a real person, not just some teaching robot. I also have two laminated posters there, one says ""Things I've learned this week"" and the other says ""Mistakes I've made this week"". It doesn't get updated every week, but it was important for my students to know that learning is a lifelong thing, not just something you're done with once you escape high school, but also that mistakes are fine. I've had so many issues with kids refusing to try in case they are wrong. 
Along the side wall, I have a women in science display that features 2-3 non-white women because I teach in an 80% Bangladeshi Muslim school and some of the girls, it has never even occured to them they can be scientists. 
I also have my ""Our Expectations"" board where at the start of the year every student wrote down what I should expect from them and what they should expect from me and we pinned them to the board. Again, I use it for reminding students about their behavioural choices. 
On the remaining two walls, I have mostly windows so there's not much space for displays. I have two small displays, one about bees and one about Goldilocks planets, on two pillars between windows. I also have posters with lab equipment drawing conventions dotted around the room, and throughout the year, I'll put up a few copies of students work.
I also have some ""Are you making the right choice?"" posters placed in the areas where students tend not to make the right choices - by the fire escape where they can see into the other classroom by pulling back the curtain, by the back corner where the equipment cupboards are. I know it's kinda cringe, but it just gives them a little extra reminder before they make their decision."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks! I at least want to have a bank of ideas in my head for handling common situations. If you have the time, could you elaborate on the most common problems you have in terms of management/behavior/discipline? I know it varies by school and by class, but I'd still like to hear any advice you have, especially since you teach high school and social studies."
highschoolteachers,"Cheerleader and motivational speaker. I teach high school math. Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to sell a product that the kids don't want and they've been told for years that they don't want it. I have to encourage, praise, and celebrate all day long to keep my kids motivated."
highschoolteachers,"If you're in America, and the language causing you trouble is Spanish, YOU SHOULD LEARN SPANISH. It's not an unreasonable expectation that an adult professional in really any career in this country speak Spanish. Even if you never use it (which, I don't even know how that's possible), it makes you look more qualified than the other candidates for your job. Plus, it's one of the easiest languages to learn, at any age. Give it a year of *real work* and you can stumble confidently through a conversation with a native. I took some Spanish in high school and college, and I'm working on learning more on my own with Rosetta Stone and LearnSpanish.com. 

As far as other languages are concerned, there's plenty of apps and services for overcoming language barriers in the classroom. Google translate, human translators, websites, using symbols in your directions (scissors for cut, etc...), a million ESL (English as a Second Language) support websites for every age and subject. Many schools have ESL teachers who help out with these things, too. It's slow going and frustrating, but it's doable. And I know students and parents feel better when they have a teacher who is genuinely trying his or her best to meet them in the middle. "
highschoolteachers,"It's for high school kids, grade 9 I believe. That's a cool IG BTW, Thanks! "
highschoolteachers,"As others have mentioned, the ages are just different. Middle school students are not self-motivated like high school students.

One thing though, don't talk over them - they are not listening to you if they're talking themselves. If the noise level gets too high, call for their attention, then wait until they are all quiet (continue to look directly at those still talking and their friends will soon quiet them). Then let them know that if it gets that high again... they will have to work individually, or stay in for a minute at lunch.. just a small deterrent. Then walk amongst them and let individuals know if they get too loud. But make sure you carry through with the punishment if necessary. But hey, if they're on task, you're doing well!

With defiant students, make sure you treat them with respect and talk to them individually and quietly. Ask them if there's something you can help them with or if they're having a bad day. If you're calm and supportive, they might end up feeling bad and changing their mind.

Good luck! Subbing is great preparation for your own class, I highly recommend it. Even if you do need wine at the end of the day ;)"
highschoolteachers,"I'm not sure what kind of statistics you're trying to collect, but it may be worthwhile for you to include a field that allows respondents to specify how long they have been in the profession. You also may want to control for the type of school at which your respondents teach (i.e. public, charter, public magnet, independent, parochial, etc).

I know you're doing a high school project, and I don't know what class it's for or what your research goals are, but there are a fair number of variables that you're not really controlling for that could skew your results, especially when you're already polling a fairly non-representative sampling of teachers (i.e. redditors).

Sorry - I'm not trying to rain on your parade. In general, your survey looks pretty good, and I applaud you devoting your research efforts to this topic. I just teach research and statistical methodology to seniors, so I naturally nitpick about stuff like this. Please post your findings when your project is done. I'm sure others on here would love to see them!"
highschoolteachers,"Well I teach high school, so I have six classes and 140 students.  Each class as a folder for assignments I will hand out.  Each student in each class has their own individual folder... I keep these folders.  I pass them out at the beginning of the period and collect them at the end.  Any work to be handed back goes in their folders and they remove it... any work to be collected goes into their folders and I grade it at the end of the day.  Unless it's a test or a major research paper, work gets graded in a 1 or 2 day turnaround time.  Folders are organized by row so each day I just pass a stack of five or six folders to the person in the front and they take theirs and pass the rest back.  I've found this is the most efficient way to return papers while also protecting student privacy (no one know who turned work in or who didn't do it, grades are never shown).

If I taught elementary school, had one group of kids for the whole day, I'm sure it would be something completely different."
highschoolteachers,"I have some tangential advice, and I'm sorry if it is not what you are looking for.  I wanted to be a college professor myself, and after having taught in both classroom environments, I now am firmly convinced that twelfth grade is where I want to be.

In a small classroom, you are ""one"" with the class, you are a part of them, and they give you feedback via smiles, laughs, passionate questions, and general openness.  In an auditorium-style lecture hall, you are somehow, inexplicably, not a part of the classroom. They look at you as though you were a youtube clip, and your jokes fall embarrassingly flat. If you look at students they give you no emotive feedback.  It is stifling.

There is a common thought that college students are paying to be there, and therefore, will be more attentive. I did not find this to be the case.

Getting a PhD is respectable, and I understand that, but the experience you get teaching high school will be invaluable to you. It will give you context, it will allow you to teach in a more developmentally accurate way, and it will make you a better professor (by a lot) after experiencing it.

On a side note, I can't help but feel that college is in a bubble. Costs are skyrocketing and have to ""give"" soon.  Secondary Ed teachers are being hit with a wave of instability in the form of union-busting and schools being arbitrarily labeled as ""failing,"" but I still feel like it is a more stable job choice in the long run at this time.

I hope I was helpful in some fashion."
highschoolteachers,"You shouldn't have to explain this at this level of education. No excuses, no mercy. S/He's trying to play you, flunk him/her. Or, yknow, do whatever your Dean says to do, obviously. If this was high school or something, I'd understand, but this kid has been writing papers for years. S/He knows. They're just trying to play you.

Edit: typos"
highschoolteachers,"If you're student teaching at a high school, reach out to the person in charge of the ACT and AP testing about being a proctor. The ACT is administered once per month during the school year (on Saturdays) and the pay is very good for a few hours of your time. The best money is in administering to the kids who are approved for extended time. AP testing may be more difficult for you to proctor since it happens during the school day in May."
highschoolteachers,"It's still elementary school so I'd say be a little more in-his-face about collecting work and checking for missing work.

You say you've set up a box that he puts unfinished assignments in... then the box goes into his backpack.  Is there an organized, specific folder you established with the mom where you said ""This folder is for his unfinished assignments each day.  Please check this folder."" or is it just a random folder that he puts stuff in, old tests, completed assignments, art projects, and unfinished work?  For a student with organizational issues, we do something similar at the high school level and it seems to work. 

You didn't mention if the child was on an IEP or 504 plan for his disorganization.  This is important.  If he is on an IEP and you are not following the guidelines this is bad for you.

Your job is to communicate with parents about their child's progress.  If the parent has told you she does not check the portal and wants you to contact her other ways, you need to do that.  Maybe her computer is unable to access the portal.  Maybe she only has computer access at work and e-mail is fine but the portal is behind a wall.

Since you teach elementary school, you need to check missing assignments more frequently than ""when students ask me.""  I'm not even sure what this means.  When I was in 5th grade I would have loved to know my missing assignments but I would have been afraid of approaching my teacher, because I was that shy.  Sending them home is great... how?  In that folder?  Once a week is a great timeline.  Once a month is not.

E-mailing and talking on the phone is a great way of communicating with parents.  You should do more of this and less relying on the portal in terms of communicating with this particular parent.  It sounds like she does not want to or cannot use the portal but e-mail is fine.  Plus, with e-mail and phone calls you know she received your messages if she responds.  You never know if she checked the portal."
highschoolteachers,"I'm super late to this thread, but just wanted to point out that one of my teachers (from my Christian high school) on Facebook (who I'm not even friends with) is in a public group called ""My blood alcohol content is higher than my GPA"".... classy. So unimpressed."
highschoolteachers,I had the same question. I think Gov is almost always high school though.
highschoolteachers,"If you really want to be a history teacher, 100% go for it, but it's definitely the most difficult field of teaching to get a job in.  I was talking to my principal the other day (I work at a high school in LA).  He said for every job opening, he gets about 40 apps in Math/Science, 100 in English, and 250 in History.  It's not to say it's not doable, but it's far more competitive than other fields. 
THAT being said, most history teachers I know are only moderately in love with history, so if you truly love the subject, GO FOR IT because you will be better than most "
highschoolteachers,"Is this an international student? I've had some similar issues with students who are not from my country. 

When you allowed the student to make up the first paper, did they do it correctly when they made it up? If so, this student knows what to do, and you communicated it correctly. They're just being a smart ass, and trying to get out of doing the work. And probably got away with this shit in high school."

highschoolteachers,"In the comments you said this is for a college level course, that the student had done this before and you allowed them to redo the paper.

My first question is did you see a marked improvement between that first paper and the make up? If so, the student knows what they should have done.

Maybe this isn't the right way to go about it, but I would let the student go to the dean and make him or herself look like an absolute idiot. You already explained to this student once before why this was unacceptable and you were generous enough to allow them to correct the mistake and redo that first paper. It sounds like they not only chose not to approach you with assistance in writing for the new assignment prior to turning it in, but they deliberately made the exact same error with the second paper. They are at fault here. Quite frankly, this would be unacceptable from a middle/high school student, much less one in college. Unless your dean's an idiot or this happened with multiple students in your class(es), I wouldn't worry too much.

For the future, perhaps you could create a detailed grading rubric for writing assignments to avoid this. Maybe you could even generate writing samples so that students can refer to for how these writings are supposed to be structured AND how not to do them. Hell, if you're feeling particularly snarky, you should use this student's paper as the DO NOT DO THIS example. 

Really though, this reads as a case of a student trying to avoid work in a class they don't particularly like but have to take."
highschoolteachers,"I would let the student make up the paper, for the record, if he/she is going to the Dean. This shows good faith on your part and also allows the student to learn. I would explain that the paper is wrong because 1) he* copied directly without quotations, which is 'stealing' someone else's words, even if crediting, and 2) he did not add anything to the information, thus making it neither a critical paper or a summary of findings. I'm not sure what type of paper it was. 

*he/she in all cases

I teach 8th grade ELA. Here is how I explain research to students. They don't get it at first, so I don't think it's always students ""playing"" teachers (many teachers accept plagiarism in various subjects, if it is cited plagiarism, because their goal is for students to learn information, not to write appropriately, so that confuses things).  I always do so in 3 parts:

1. The majority of your work must be in commentary on the research, in not just summarizing but analyzing it (I teach my kids the first week what ""analyzing"" is because I use that word a lot) and explaining why this information matters to the focus of your paper and to your audience and purpose (we use RAFT intensely). A summary of research paper will have more summary, but that should also be in your own words. I explain that I am not grading the information**, but rather what they add to it. **I do explain that I may grade the reliability of their source, of course.

2. Paraphrasing is allowed, if cited, but you must use markedly different words if you are not quoting directly. If you change just 1-2 words, those go in [brackets] and you still quote. 

3. Paraphrasing and quotations should be no more than 1/2 the paper if a critical analysis and no more than 3/4 in a summary of research findings paper. A summary of research findings paper is obviously mostly research, as it's purpose is to distribute information, but that is not the type of research paper most English teachers assign (I explain this so when they go to high school they understand the expectation when the ""Research Paper"" term, which is vague, is given to them) since they want to see student analysis, not just information. 

My classes do at least 1 Summary of Research paper (to introduce a topic, usually in the Holocaust unit, where they get a portion of the topic, like Auschwitz or something) and at least 2 Analysis papers a year - generally one literary and one research-based. The best thing I do for them is show them examples of ""Good"" and ""Bad."" 

I'm not sure if you're in MS or HS or what grade level. If this is just one student and everyone else gets it, I'd show ""Good"" examples, so he gets it too. "
highschoolteachers,"All the more reason for teachers to keep up to date with what their students use. If that means having snapchat installed on their own personal phone just to see when it updates and to see what it is, so be it. If that means at least watching a youtube video on what the latest video games are so you don't mis-interpret a student saying ""I can't wait until this evening when I can go shoot Trevor again."" (An actual occurrence in my classroom earlier this year where students were talking about a specific scene in Grant Theft Auto V), then do so. 

Worst case scenario, have some go-to kids who know what's up and can fill you in (or are super eager to tell you about the new stuff) before you get taken by surprise, so that you can prepare in some fashion. I was that kid in high school always telling teachers what new neat stuff was coming out (I was in school during the iPhone 1 fallout, and blackberries were popular then) and I know teachers loved being kept in the loop, even if it wasn't super interesting what was going on.

Just because you're behind the teacher's desk doesn't mean you stop learning. Half of the job of teaching is know what your students are doing, and it's honestly not that difficult to keep up."
highschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade algebra. I assign 30-40 minutes of homework per night, and check it daily for completeness (takes max 2 minutes). They get a score out of 2- 2 if 100% done, 1 if 50% done or a day late, and 0 if not done. Answers are posted on the board for students to check on their own when they enter the classroom (I check for completeness while they are correcting). Where 8th grade is the transition to high school, we work on self advocacy and regulation. Students are in charge of correcting their own work and asking questions during the designated time."
highschoolteachers,"definitely not impossible, but as other teachers have said, head to the charters. a coworker of mine at our charter has three duis, a stint in jail, a whole lot of rehab, etc etc. stole thousands from his parents, wrecked cars and property, etc etc.  Anyway, he's six years clean, decided to go use this experience in high school to get kids to think about their choices, and now he's a damn good math teacher. it's possible, you've just gotta want it. "
highschoolteachers,"Also 22. Teaching high school and my GOD. Cell phones are ridiculous. We aren't allowed to take the phones, so I pretty much fight cell phones all the time. 

I don't understand it, but then again I didn't get a cell phone until my senior year of high school, and even then, with AP classes and everything I had going on (credit recovery as well) I didn't have TIME to text or snapchat in class. :/"
highschoolteachers,"&gt; I'm not sure why you're giving me international data I already know.

Because you are apparently okay with being in the bottom third of OECD member countries in academic achievement.

&gt; Culture is.

Which is why we have standards we should meet.  It takes all the other aspects you want to hang your hat on out of the picture.  If a students meets standards they move on.  If they don't, they need remediation.

&gt; Everyone has something to offer, and expecting everyone to fall into a narrow range of testable skills is unrealistic.

There are basic skills the states have decided every student needs to master.  If you let every special snowflake decide - in 6th grade  - to express themselves how they want, then we've reached the peak of American society.  They all want to be video game testers.

&gt; so I see no indicator that testing is the answer.

It's an indicator that you keep trying to toss out as if it is somehow invalid.  It's not THE answer, but a school with 47% of kids at standards over the past 3 years needs to be looked at and shaken up.

&gt;  ""middle school teachers""

There you go with that unattributable quote thing again.

&gt; how your having hostility towards teachers and students

I want kids and teachers to meet standards.  That's hostile?

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostile

&gt; Honestly, a big part of teaching is attitude, and yours comes off as terrible.

Yours comes off as defensive.

&gt; . I suppose if all the high schools blame the middle schools and all the middle schools blame the elementary schools and all the elementary schools blame the parents, we'll all just be okay. shrug

Cute.  How about we hold EACH accountable to STANDARDS?  

&gt; your disparagement of middle schools was

""It's a challenging age to teach. I'm hoping to get hired at a high school myself. I want to teach thinking skills, not coloring.""

In rebuttal, you've tried to explain the subtle nuances in the amount of time required to color a poster, shifted the discussion of failure to meet standards to a more comfortable one of why testing is not an accurate measurement of all facets of student growth.

It's not going to be single handed - there's a lot of dead wood to get out of the way."
highschoolteachers,"I don't take offense so much as think you are wrong and inexperienced. I've taught kids who missed the ""passing"" score on standardized tests one year and jumped ahead the next year. Children are not as mechanical as all that. 

&gt; I do think that if children can't meet standards they shouldn't pass until they do.

First of all, that's literally against the law in some cases (ESE, ESOL). 

Second of all, we have no real way to determine if kids ""can"" meet standards - just if they did on one day.

I don't think kids who don't complete coursework should pass (and sometimes they do, even in HS) but no one who has experience working with diverse populations of students would ever follow the suggestion that we pass/fail on standardized tests alone.

All this plan would lead to is less safety in Elementary and Middle Schools (it's not really safe to educate 18 year olds with 12 year olds en masse or 15 year olds with 5 year olds) a greater number of high school dropouts, especially among ESOL and ESE populations."
highschoolteachers,"In addition to all the excellent advice already posted, I would add this:

It's okay to say no.  First-year teachers are often asked to volunteer for things, take on additional responsibilities or classes, etc. because veterans and admins know they won't say no.  It's okay to say no.  You don't need to explain, or feel guilty.  The people asking aren't necessarily being malicious...we just often forget how hard and exhausting those first couple of years are, and assume that you're young and full of energy.  And some are being malicious...they'll slough off anything they can on you because they don't want to deal with it anymore.

Also, when you're interviewing for positions, remember that you're interviewing the school just as much as they are interviewing you.  Ask tough questions, make sure you get everything in writing (course load especially), and talk to current and former students, teachers, and parents of the school as much as you can before accepting a position.  You might still walk into a bad situation, but at least you do it with your eyes wide open.

And be careful who you confide in...almost every school has some political undercurrent going on that you won't know until months into the school year, and it can be toxic. Avoid it as much as possible.

And don't gossip.  Ever.  Ears and eyes wide open, mouth closed.  The gossip can be unreal, and can destroy an otherwise great working environment.  

Develop good eating and exercise habits before the school year starts. Schedule out your days down to the minute during those first few months, and make exercise, hobby, and family time non-negotiable hours.  The work will suck away every spare minute of those first few years if you don't guard against it right from the start. 

And the best advice I ever received as a high school teacher with multiple preps was this:
The first year, survive.  Save everything you create, and just toss everything that you might use someday into a file.
The second year, pick one course to really work on.  Start in the summer, find cool projects, assignments, etc. and keep working on that one course all year.
The third year, pick another course.  Etc. etc. etc.
It really does take years to develop courses from just basic to something really great...learn from veteran teachers, but don't compare yourself to them...they've been at it years longer than you have, and you will get there, but it's okay that you're not there yet!"
highschoolteachers,"You sound a lot like me -- before/after school teacher experience, then high school -- and while my first year has been incredibly challenging, it has had many bright spots as well. It's a lot of work but I'm determined to make it.

OP, thanks for this."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for this. I am finishing up my licensure now and I have always dreamed of being a teacher. I am a before/after school teacher now and can't wait to be a high school teacher. But I hear so much negativity on the internet about teaching. It has scared me and made me worry. This reminds me of why I am spending so much time, money, and effort to be a teacher. I want to make a difference. I want to challenge my students to think beyond the classroom and for them to one day make a difference. "
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for your comment.  Could you be a bit more specific as to what I can fix about my attitude?  I think it's shameful that kids are socially passed until they get to high school - is that wrong in some way?  Is less than 50% of children at standards reflective of ""a foundation for students in literacy and numeracy""?

I'm seriously not trying to be confrontational here, but 4 days allotted for kids to work on a poster is pretty ridiculous IMO.  That's my CT."
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching high school English in CA for 9 years now. Here's some things to keep in mind. In CA you can teach just about anything once you get your bachelors as long as you pass the CSET for that single subject credential. So, you could take the CSET for both English and History and have the option to teach both. Districts actually prefer you to have multiple credentials. You wouldn't be able to teach AP classes in both subjects as you can only be certified in the subject of your bachelors. Another thing to keep in mind, English is a more work than most other subjects because you'll be grading a lot of essays. I would also recommend taking a look at the new common core standards. There's heavy emphasis on reading and writing. Education is going through some changes, which could be a good thing for new teachers because I have a feeling it will lead to some retiring sooner rather than later. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"There are plenty of programs that will allow you to work while you get your credential... check out mount st Mary's program if in the la area. The problem would be finding employment without a credential. Most unified and charter schools require one. Catholic and private schools do not. Check out a website called indeed.com for postings of all schools. As to the cset, is hard, but nothing you can't brush up on, foo to your local library and check out a dummy guide to the social studies cset. Pm me and I'll give you my website if you need refresher PowerPoints for world and us history which are heard toward high school level"
highschoolteachers,"I think standardized testing is monumentally important. I've experienced standardized testing in several states, and the tests that demonstrate student mastery in Massachusetts are almost unrecognizably different from the tests that demonstrate mastery in Oklahoma. Without having nationally authored tests for mastery, we're holding up students to entirely different standards based purely on where they grow up. 

(Just within Social Studies, where Massachusetts has students drawing thoughtful conclusions from charts showing nations' standards of living, Oklahoma has students correctly identifying the location of nations; where Massachusetts has students comparing two primary sources' perspectives, Oklahoma has students correctly naming the first five presidents in order. This is not acceptable.)

If we don't say that there is some basic body of knowledge or set of skills that all students should have, and ensure that classrooms are reinforcing that knowledge and those skills, the idea of a high school diploma becomes meaningless. And every experience I've had in my own teaching career suggests that standards unaccompanied by tests frequently become ignored standards. 

(As a 7th grade Social Studies teacher, I live this every day: kids don't take a single Social Studies test in elementary school in my state, which means that teachers rarely examine the standards for what they are supposed to teach. Kids sometimes show up with vast and varied experiences learning about the Kennedy assassination for months on end--but not knowing their continents. Many schools cut Social Studies and Science in untested years altogether.)

We need to make sure that schools equip students with basic knowledge and skills. Standardized testing is necessary to our accomplishing that."
highschoolteachers,"I have successfully predicted three drug-related overdoses, two murderers, and many abusers.  I taught them all in high school in the course of three years (at a private religious school) and started seeing the results trickle in three to four years after they graduated.  I never wanted to be right about any of them, because they all had so much potential to do amazing things with their lives.  There are more predictions that haven't come true, but I see them heading down the path closer and closer.  It sucks when you can see it coming but are totally powerless to stop any of it.  I invest my life in these kids, and it's very hard not to wonder what I could have done differently that might have made a difference."
highschoolteachers,"I do this like every day. I teach high school, but I have absolutely no problem saying to a kid ""Hey, stop being annoying"" when they are tapping on their desk or something similar. I also bluntly say things like ""You are being really obnoxious right now and you need to stop"" when someone is shouting to their friend across the room. I have never been contacted or approached about this. 

I would stand your ground if you can get the admins on your side. Just straight up say ""Yes, I found the students behavior very irritating and off topic. When a student is misbehaving I tell them exactly what they are doing wrong."" If the admins aren't on your side, apologize and start applying to other districts. If parent drama is this trigger-sensitive you need some new admins. 

Disclaimer- I have a few advantages going for me. I am always blunt with my students and I toss around both positive and negative language all of the time, so maybe they expect it and don't complain. I am also male, which tragically plays into these things. "
highschoolteachers,"I think it depends on where you are. I'm working on my physics major with a teaching license right now and at the high school I attended (with ~1600 students, suburbs), we had 4 full time physics teachers (who may teach one section of physical science to 9th grade, which is still physics principles), as well as several other physical science teachers. But definitely look into the job market in your area. Schoolspring is a great place to kind of feel out whether those ""purely physics"" jobs really do exist in your area. Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I'm in college now, dream career is teaching at my old high school (Catholic) for biology. Did you teach public prior to Catholic and how was the transition?"
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for your input. I understand where you're coming from because I grew up in the south and attended a public high school that suffered from lack of funding. I know that salaries are not high anywhere in the south, but fortunately the cost of living is much more reasonable than where I am currently. I work and live in an area of LA that is extremely expensive and risk facing horrendous traffic every day (and gallons more of gas) if I do choose to move to somewhere more affordable locally. In Mississippi, I can get a 1BD apartment for ~400. In my area of Los Angeles, it's more like ~1200. The median salary only differs by about 10 grand. I'm sorry if this has been a tangent. I will definitely research the links you sent and consider my decision more."
highschoolteachers,"This was about my experience. I was brought up without any religion but taught in a catholic high school for 2 years. Funny thing was, many of students were openly atheist. The school was a vocational high school with a great reputation so all types of students came to it. The only issue I ever had was a gay student who got really upset because the religion teacher told him ""enough of this *gay* stuff"" in front of the class. I felt bad that I wasn't able to tell him my true beliefs and help him feel a little better."
highschoolteachers,"You have my dream job. I want to go back to my catholic high school and teach science there. 

Way to go man! "
highschoolteachers,"Atheist teacher chiming in here. I went to Catholic elementary school as a child and taught at an Irish Catholic junior/senior high school for a year. I was not raised Catholic. My parents sent us to the Catholic elementary school because they didn't want us (my brother and me) associating with the white trash of the village near us. Anyway, my aunt is a principal at a Catholic elementary school that feeds into the high school that I worked in. Long story short, I think I got the job on my last name alone. But, let me tell you, it was the greatest job. The pay sucked, but I loved it there. The kids were great. The parents were super supportive. It was a great job. I would go back there in a heartbeat if it paid as well as my public school job. 

We had to go to mass once a month. Nobody thought it was weird that I didn't get up for communion. Hell, one of my co-workers was Jewish. My faith (or lack thereof) never came into question. Like I said. I loved that job."
highschoolteachers,"This is usually not a particularly chronic issue with a few students, it's more of a desire of mine to have a collaborative culture of excellence that I want to foster and give students a responsibility to each other, not just themselves. 

Here's an example: I teach vocabulary to high school students and our books come with extensive exercises that I think are repetitious and have limited payoff for their time invested. Instead, I assign a creative story that they must write including the words, then the next day we trade papers around and evaluate sentences for both vocabulary and various syntax and grammar items we're working on. 
"
highschoolteachers,"I teach at a Catholic Middle school and grew up catholic, but haven't attended mass outside of school function since I was in high school.  For the most part, you do not have to be overtly religious in any way to teach at a catholic school.  Almost half of our staff is protestant and we even have a librarian who is Jewish, so you don't even have to be Catholic at most schools.

You will be expected to attend prayer services and mass, start each class with a short prayer, keep a cross in your room, etc. but you personally don't have to do anything you aren't comfortable with.  I always let my kids lead prayer, so I don't have to think of one and get involved in it too much.

Most school have dedicated religion teachers who will take care of the real ""what it means to be a catholic stuff,"" so you don't have to worry too much if you don't know much about the bible.  Personally, I hardly know anything about the bible.  I haven't read it.  I'm Catholic, I have it read to me.


One thing you do have to be careful of is to never hint that god may not exist.  A teacher at my school last year was not thinking and started out a sentence with ""If there is a god...""  You would not believe the shitstorm that came down the pipes for that one.  

Other than that, it's actually a pretty good gig.  The pay is shit, but other than that it really isn't hard to just play along with the more religious bits and have a good time.

One great perk is that you will have an, on average, much higher level of autonomy within your classroom than you would find in a public school.  You also don't usually have to deal with as many standardized tests, and the ones you do take are often used as formative assessments, which is a nice departure from the ""these scores will determine your pay scale,"" route many states seem to be fond of taking these days.

Hope that helps  "
highschoolteachers,"In New York City, it is high stakes for the kids.  Since there are so many public schools they can apply to attend for middle school and high school, they are constantly told they have to do well if they want to get into the best schools.  It causes so much anxiety in our students, that is makes me disheartened to see.  When I taught middle school, I tried to express that a person's complete knowledge and worth was not based on three days of testing and that I was proud of them no matter what. "
highschoolteachers,"I am essentially doing this, using one of my better units where I had solid periodic assessments of varying types throughout and showing how students improved in two of my 4 sections.  Going through all of the data is making me cross-eyed.  I'm also going back to previous years and evaluating marking period grades and state test scores for my lowest third from when I taught middle school.  My school doesn't do state tests for the high school as we are exempt, and while it may seem awesome to other schools and I've heard my fair share of jealous comments regarding it, it would be nice in times like these to have concrete data from the state that verifies I can do my job well.

I also gave a student survey earlier in the year that I'm going to use to show my students perception of my teaching, as they were for the most part extremely positive."
highschoolteachers,"Answered. Good luck! 

(P.S.- I'm currently interning at a high school, but I student taught in 3rd/4th grade last year, so that's what my answers are about.)"
highschoolteachers,"3 days ago you were [just a teenage boy with acne](http://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/23rc63/so_i_went_to_the_dermatologist_for_the_first_time/) and today you're a high school english teacher! Way to achieve your goals, man!

In all seriousness, Sparknotes will help you understand the most basic, bare-bones version of a book or story. It is dry and boring and only helpful if you're struggling to get the basics (in which case it can actually be really helpful, say with Shakespeare or Faulkner, for many readers). If you're relying on it for your project, your project sucks because it is boring and you only understand the book's plot on a basic, bare-bones level, and this is a bigger problem. There's no way you're saying anything interesting about whatever book you just (didn't) read.

It is usually painfully, painfully obvious when a student hasn't read the material. A lot of times students are careless enough to actually plagiarize the summary they found online. They tend to think the exact same things sparknotes lists as important about the book are what is actually important or interesting about the book (rarely true). Like, oh, MacBeth is about power and prophecy? However did you think that up? You are brilliant, really.

If you're in a pinch, and you didn't get to read and don't have time now, well, do what you have to do, but your grade will reflect it and your teacher will be able to tell. Just don't plagiarize. "
highschoolteachers,"You actually hold kids back in 8th grade?  One of the problems here is that you can fail every class in 8th grade, including any standardized tests and you will go on to high school.

Not until high school does passing or failing count for anything."
highschoolteachers,"Heads up though, there is no such thing as a high school physics teacher. You may teach physics but teaching physics won't be a full work-load. Even if you teach two sections of physics you'll still be required to fill your timetable with other courses. 

You might also start teaching general science to a bunch of asshole grade 9 kids for five or six years or more before you manage to get a teaching job that includes some physics. 

My goal here is to inform your expectations only. I am a former wildlife researcher turned high school teacher. I teach grade 9 math, should be an opening in the science department next year though."
highschoolteachers,Woah that is a very interesting cultural difference. I went to high school in southern California. I'd say about 1/3 of the Social Science/History teachers at my high school coached. 
highschoolteachers,"What state are you in that you already got test scores back?

As far as testing goes this is a transition year for us in California.  My high school gave the new sbac test to juniors and gave the old test to sophomores and juniors.  I don't know why anyone cares about the scores.  The old test scores were for nclb and that ends this year and the new test is just a pilot so the scores are expected to be bad."
highschoolteachers,"Hi, I teach Physics at a private school so I may be able to help. Short answer, you can absolutely get a job teaching high school Physics! 

We love PhD's, but we especially love PhD's who can teach. Sell yourself on how smart/accomplished you are and all the great research you've done, but don't forget to show why you want to teach high school, and how you are going to reach a bunch of 16 year olds who don't know how to GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE FREAKING DENOMINATOR. Whoa, sorry, had an outburst.

Anyway, if you are someone who is well-versed and passionate in your subject, you are already doing well. Have some talking points prepared on why you would like to take the pay-cut to teach high school (because you will be asked), and be able to explain things at a low level. You don't have to remember everything about intro, because you will reteach yourself some things.

Some background on me-I just have a B.A. in Physics and did a 1 year teaching fellowship teaching middle school math. I am a young woman, which helped since I now work at a private girls' school. Let me know if you need any more help and good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"""I technically have to apply to the graduate school in order to be accepted"" 

I'm not going to graduate school, it's just a formality of going to get my teaching certification after I have already graduated with two undergraduate degrees.

Also, I'm not back and forth about teaching. I was back and forth about teaching high school specifically because I have heard so many horror stories from elementary/middle school teachers on this subreddit and other forums about their high school teaching experiences. I just didn't want this to turn into a ""why you shouldn't teach high school"" discussion so I tried a preemptive strike that I guess wasn't communicated well. "
highschoolteachers,"Here in Germany if you want to teach a ""modern"" foreign language at the ""highest"" high school (we have a complicated school system), you have to know Latin and at least one other modern foreign language besides the one you want to teach. Which means I learned Latin in school and had to do courses in Spanish at university to be allowed to do the state exams."
highschoolteachers,"I'm with hellokrissi, but I know it's different in every province.

By public sector, do you simply mean public schools? If so, you're going to be applying to specific jobs, not ""Hey! I'm part of your union, give me a job!"" so realistically, you just apply for the high school jobs available. I'd look at applytoeducation.com, and educationcanada.com as good starts. If you're in Alberta, districtofficeonline.ca is where most of the boards put up their postings. "
highschoolteachers,"Difficult is subjective. I graduated high school with a 3.9 and graduated college with honors and similar GPA. I thought, at times, things were challenging. Not so much content since I was just ""good at school"", but learning to become a more effective teacher is hard no matter how much you read.  I think what you're feeling represents a common feeling that beginning teachers feel unprepared and overwhelmed.

Practicum is always the most valuable part of any college course. This is where you learn classroom management and the day-to-day dealings. This is where you gain experience working with actual struggling students and irate parents. This is where you encounter positive and negative coworkers. These things can't be taught in a classroom because they have to be experienced.

It bothers me when people claim education is an easy degree. Content knowledge wise, it's probably not challenging. After all, we all passed K-12 and it's our second pass learning. Is this what you're referring to? The ""hard stuff"" is learning to become effective, and content knowledge gained from books and classes isn't going to get you there without experience. You could know every psychological educational theory, know your subject matter front and back, and be up on the latest research-backed classroom management strats and teaching styles, but how far does that go if you lack experience with dealing with real-life interactions? It HELPS, but probably not as much as you think.

Subbing is good experience but it's not reflective of full-time teaching. I find subbing too easy and all you are really is a babysitter. You have to manage the class, but you aren't responsible for planning effective instruction, using data to reflect improvements and drive that instruction, dealing with parents and colleagues, and so on. Subbing doesn't really teach you much more than the difference between real-world learning environments and a bit of classroom management.

Maybe your program just sucks? I felt very satisfied and prepared after my 4 1/2 year teacher prep program. We underwent student teaching, a semester of methods (a lesser student teaching experience), a reading remediation program where we worked with struggling students, and a team teaching experience where we worked closely with a special ed teacher to explore differentiation. I felt it was pretty much the best prep I could get. 

I took classes on all kinds of things, and they weren't always challenging in terms of time commitment and getting a good grade, but student teaching experiences are. It's NOT like subbing and it's NOT always a positive experience for even bright education majors. I've seen bright students fall flat on their face and goof offs become decent teachers. That meat and potatoes of it is student teaching, and student teaching is usually hard.

"
highschoolteachers,"1. They have to like the students, whatever age level they are.  If you're teaching high school, you better genuinely enjoy hanging out with teenagers- they can smell a fake a mile away.

2. They have to have inner-authority, and the belief that they are in control of the classroom.  This doesn't mean that they're loud or authoritarian.  Some of the most soft-spoken teachers can have the most inner authority, but if you don't have this, particularly in secondary education, students will not respect you.  Self confidence is key.

3. Pedagogical chops.  You need to have enough educational theory that you can effectively theorize your own practice.  Without this ability, you are essentially throwing strategies at your class and seeing what works.  The best teachers I've seen and worked with have always had the ability to construct theories of learning and education based on their education and their experiences in the classroom, and to test and modify those theories as they teach.  

4. Reflective Capability.  This is huge.  If you can't recognize what you're doing that's not working, how are you going to fix it?  Likewise, you need to ability to really recognize effective strategies so you can continue to use them.

5. Interest and curiosity.  Students will follow your lead- if you are passionate and interested about things, they will follow that.  If you are uninterested, they will pick up on that and will likely be disengaged.

6. Content Knowledge.  The deeper your content knowledge, the more you'll be able to develop frameworks to help your students understand it at a complex level.  This can definitely be developed on the job, but I always like to see teachers who are always striving to learn new things about what they are teaching."
highschoolteachers,If you teach STEM in a Title school (junior high/high school) for 5 years you can get up to 15k of student loans forgiven.  Elementary teachers in low-income schools can get up to 5k forgiven.  
highschoolteachers,"Australian high school teacher here. I have 6 subjects to prepare for 8 classes of kids. 
1 7 Humanities
1 7 RE
1 8 RE
2 8 Humanities
1 9 Humanities
2 9 RE

This isn't unusual. Most years are like this. Last year I had four subjects to prepare for ten classes, which was highly unusual. "
highschoolteachers,"Until this year, I would have said no. I have a deep, booming, voice and definitely think it is an advantage. But yelling. No.

But this year I moved to a high school with a high rate of rural poverty. Most of my students are unbelievably noisy, resistant to any engagement and frankly, rude. I am in my 8th year teaching HS Science. I started re-reading Ruby Payne's ""Framework for Understanding Poverty"" and immediately recognized some aspects of this culture which is new to me. My students are likely to come from homes where a tv is never off and multiple siblings yell and scream for a dearth of attention. Conversations with my kids seem to indicate this is not far from the mark. Consequently, they try to act this way in class and think there is nothing wrong with it.

Along those lines, I quickly learned that I have a group of students (significant proportion) who do not think I am serious unless I yell. I think this is an aspect of their poverty culture. It is what they are used to and it is what they expect. Honestly, it makes me, a 44 year-old man, want to cry for them.

I feel somewhat stuck between what I feel is right and what I feel the situation seems to dictate.

"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a middle/high school female teacher in my 20's. I consider myself pretty fashionable, so I like to keep my interview outfits age-appropriate, but conservative. My advice is you can't really be too formal, but you can definitely be too casual. I like a cute pencil skirt and a blouse, or a dress and a cardigan. If you're more of a pants gal, just make sure they fit and you pair them with a nice top. I always wear flats, but a short heel always works. You can make it a little more personal with a necklace or earrings.

We recently had a candidate come in who was dressed in black pants and basically a t-shirt, and one of my coworkers just couldn't look past how unprofessional she looked. 

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for your reply! I didn't answer most of these replies when I posted this originally, but I do want thank everyone who replied, because the replies were extremely helpful.

Some of this answer is rather depressing. I'm sorry you're losing control over your curriculum. I am still rather confused by common core and the way people talk about it; sometimes it seems it is just vague guidelines (like ""teach close-reading""), other times it seems to be about testing, and yet here it seems like common core is mandating which texts you actually teach! Does this mean every single 7th grader in the state of NY is supposed to read the exact same books? That's not a very well thought out idea... I can't imagine your rural, conservative 7th grade students appreciating and being interested in the exact same texts as a group of urban, liberal 7th graders. *Night* does, though, actually seem like a text that would work well for most students in a number of contexts, yet it's not ""approved""? Again: depressing.
Now this was more than a decade ago, but when I was in high school, I attended a school with 5 to 10% Muslim students (a number that has likely doubled in that district since). I remember that the only text we ever read with a Muslim character was a poorly-written (or so I thought at the time), young adult book about a white boy fighting against some Muslim terrorists. I remember thinking even then (as a non-Muslim) what a terrible choice of book this was, especially since it was the ONLY time Islam ever came up in that class. It seemed like such a contextless choice. It seems to me that context is (almost) everything, so the entire concept of common core hits me the wrong way.

Academia has its own share of problems, and I'm willing to take on the problems of secondary education for the many benefits, so I don't want to seem that I'm down on the system before I've even begun. I do hope there is room to move, though, and that I am able to find a job that allows me the freedom to assign books with my specific students in mind. The ability to switch up the planned text halfway through the year because I realize a particular group of studnets has some particular interest would be especially wonderful.

I will probablly teach in an urban environment, though I just don't know until I really hit the job market. I will most likely be in Ohio, but Florida is a possibility as well. Thanks for your reply!

EDIT: Found the book we read. http://www.amazon.com/After-First-Death-Robert-Cormier/dp/0440208351"
highschoolteachers,"On the other hand, testing begins this week at my high school. Arrrgh. "
highschoolteachers,Then they graduate early. Michael Kearney graduated high school at age 8. 
highschoolteachers,I've run into students at bars and I teach high school.  I've even been waited on by current and former students at a local bar/resteraunt.  They didn't care and I didn't care.  Why should they?
highschoolteachers,"

I taught high school bio as a student teacher. Late one Saturday night I was loudly and foully playing SF2 on the big screen at the college campus arcade. As I was brutally killing my opponent I was aware of a tall person standing close to my left side. I look up to see one of my students who smiled and said, ""Hello, Ms. Mathsciteach."""
highschoolteachers,"I literally never consider parents when I'm planning my lessons.  Every once in a while I'll get an email from a parent that says something along the lines of, ""I graduated from college and have no idea how to do the problems you're assigning!""  If the parent was in my class I'd be concerned about that, but they're not, so I don't worry over it.

I teach high school math (but basically college math since everything is pretty much a very advanced pre-calculus class and up), which might have something to do with my attitude toward this."
highschoolteachers,"Usually high school should have programs in place for advanced students. AP courses are set up for students to start taking college level classes before they graduate. If a student is really advanced to a point where they are years ahead, they can skip a grade."
highschoolteachers,"Thank you so much for your answer! and for the 4th one, if you take a test that says you scored higher than 90% of seniors in High School based on national high school level criteria then why should you go to High School if you already proved you have the know how for it.

This assuming the test contains
4 Science Subjects (Earth Science, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
4 English Subjects (Reading, Writing, Grammar, and Vocabulary)
4 Math Subjects (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Calculus)
And a Proficiency Exam (In Music, Languages, and Art)"
highschoolteachers,"I.  Yes, I think so.  

II.  This is not a question...

III.  This is why Common Core is being introduced.

IV. I teach history.  It's always the last subject to get the official test.  Massachusetts, where I live, has the MCAS.  First it piloted ELA.  Then it adopted ELA and piloted math.  Then it adopted math and piloted Biology and Chemistry.  Then it adopted Biology and Chemistry and piloted History.  Then it ran out of money and stopped piloting history and now we're switching to new types of tests.  And it will go English, Math, Science, History, and by the time it gets to history they'll be moving on to something new.  So it's not a test or fail situation for me. 

As for your question regarding testing out and not having to go through all of high school or middle school... school is about more than being taught information.  School makes you into a person.  It teaches you discipline and hard work and *socialization*.  So could you test out and go to college and do work that is appropriate to your level of knowledge at age 12?  Sure.  But good luck being able to communicate with people, ever, without that early socialization.  

V.  My district bases pay on experience + education level.  So if you're teaching 5 years and you have  PhD and your colleague is teaching 5 years and has a masters you will make like $10k more.  But if you're teaching 18 years with just a bachelor's and someone else starts teaching with a PhD and they're like 3 years in, they might make more than you.  Pay varies by district.

If you think teaching is all about low wages, ""annoying kids"", and you're concerned about responsibility and amount of work perhaps you should think of a different field.

I'm not treated like the scum of society.  I meet strangers and they praise me for teaching like it's some impossible task that they could never do.  It surprises me because I was under the assumption that people looked down on teachers, but I've never encountered that in person.

I make a lot of money.  Next year I will make over $70k and it will be my 9th year.  This is because I have a lot of education.  I plan to hit the highest salary level I can as soon as I can, so that would be another 30 graduate credits and another four years of teaching.  And then I will make just shy of $95k.  Factor in the very little amount I pay for health insurance and the great coverage I get and I would say I make more than many people I know of the same age/education level as myself.

I'm not sure what you're trying to ask here.  Are you looking for people to tell you this job sucks?  Are you looking for people to prove you wrong?  You have a lot of ideas about what it's like to be a teacher and I feel like your only experience in that is what you perhaps went through in high school.  I went to HS in NY and I teach HS in Massachusetts and neither experience is anything like what you are describing."
highschoolteachers,"I've been teaching high school English for 13 years now and sadly, I do have regrets. Students these days just do not value education. I often feel my efforts are wasted. Prepare yourself as what you learn in your credential program does not prepare you for what you will actually encounter in the classroom!! 

As for teaching AP, often those classes are assigned to teachers based on seniority. It could takes years before you have that opportunity. New teachers are usually given the 'leftovers', the classes no one else wants to teach.

Alas, it's not all bad :) You have summers off if you choose. I wish you lots of luck. "
highschoolteachers,"Either your classes are too difficult for you or you didn't give it your effort. Stop signing up for classes above your skill level. Failing one class, *uhh okay*, but failing four classes just seems like you lack serious motivation. Your school year is about to end. It's the fourth quarter and you just now started to think about how to salvage your high school career!

You have no idea how hard all teachers work to get unmotivated students to try. We pull our hair out wondering how we have failed you. We switch up our seating charts, lesson plans, and attend professional development to engage *you*. Even the teacher you hate does this. Until you realize you **have** to meet your teachers halfway, you will never be successful in school. Meeting others halfway is how people become successful in life.

Get a grip and talk to your teachers first. Explain the situation and see if you can make a deal or salvage your grades. After, talk to your counselor and form a game plan. Stop closing the door on the possibility of college. "
highschoolteachers,"Glad to hear this.  I'm entering an alt cert program this summer and received this as recommended reading.  I find everything interesting so far, but was wondering if people have really been able to take the methods into the classroom.  Mind if I ask what age group you teach?  I'm trying to teach high school physics (coming from engineering)."
highschoolteachers,"I would be happier if I got ""what can I do to raise my grade?""

It has not happened often but the main times I remember high school seniors in AP Science classes hit me with ""can I convince you to raise my grade?"".  I immediately informed them of the missing assignments they could complete and raise their grades.  One student took the advice and promptly did nothing about it.

I console myself with the thought that I am still teaching them an important lesson..."
highschoolteachers,"The great thing about job shadowing, too, is that you can begin to narrow your interests. If I were you, I'd shadow a couple teachers in each possible age range and subject area you're considering. 

One piece of advice: try to shadow teachers who are in schools with marked differences; go to a magnet and non-magnet, for example, or charter and traditional public, affluent area and low-income area. You might find that your passion is specific to a type of school and subject area. More to the point, teaching 3rd grade in a charter school serving a low-income community is so different from teaching high school English in an affluent community that they might as well be different professions altogether."
highschoolteachers,"What school do you go to? WWU has an English major with secondary teaching endorsement you can get by taking some extra classes. No education major needed, but it is to teach middle or high school only. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a family member who was repeatedly in the hospital several years ago. If I had any sort of bug, I was unable to visit. I took a few precautions that I've since adopted into my routine to avoid most colds/flus that come along. I don't borrow pens/pencils from students or colleagues. I don't lend my personal pencils/pens to students (even just for a moment). I try not to touch students' laptops (keyboards). I wash my hands repeatedly throughout the day.

In high school, I remember my health teacher telling us to freeze. She pointed out that most of us have our hands around our faces and that this was the most common method of transmission. It really stuck with me.

Good luck and I hope you feel better. P.S. A good multivitamin always helps, too! :)"
highschoolteachers,"I know it was a problem when I was going to school, but it's gotten much better. Kids are much more tolerant, but in fifth grade it's probably more based on parents. At the high school age kids are forming their own opinions separate from the home and so you get a lot more tolerance (or not depending on the culture).

I shut down any ""fag"" or ""gay"" talk on day one. Or two. Or whatever day I hear it. If students are working and chatting quietly on some assignment while I take attendance and I hear anyone say anything like that the first words out of my mouth are ""Excuse me?!"". Everyone in the room stares at me. ""If I hear that word again you'll be writing me a paragraph and I'll be calling home. End it. Now.""

Generally, I get wide-eyed stares for a few seconds while students get back to work and I never hear the words again. If it were lower grades I might treat it like a teachable moment, but in high school they know better. And if *they* don't then their peers do and me speaking up usually gets their friends to agree so they stop and learn."
highschoolteachers,"Aww :( I taught 8th grades for several years and in my beginning procedures I've always explained that, when used as expletives, ""gay"" and ""retard"" were considered hate speech and wouldn't be tolerated. I've taken that message to high school and it's always worked well. I wonder if it might work on 5th graders?"
highschoolteachers,I'm very Goal Oriented myself which is why it was a real eye opener to consider that many of the individuals I work with simply aren't focused on the job at hand. It's been a real struggle to learn that meetings are not usually about communicating information but are more like a mini pep rally (a task I hated attending in high school).
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school teacher and from Australia, so take this with a grain of salt, but here are some thoughts: 

You've got six or eight weeks to wow the principal - you could try to have the classes write an example of each text type mandated by the common core (opinionative, informative and narrative) OR pick one text type and develop their ability to produce that type in greater depth. If you try to cover all three, will 90 minutes (two weeks - all you'll get for each text type if you are only there for six weeks) be enough time to teach the text type and plan, write and polish a whole piece? You should definitely have them writing every time you see them but with only one lesson a week it might be hard to get them to finish several pieces. 

I'd be looking for some cross-curricular links to save time teaching content (in the sense of what you want them to write about) - they could write an informative piece that talks about what they're studying in science, for example, or an opinion piece based on what they're learning about in music or art, or a narrative that uses prompts from social studies topics. 

I'd also be making use of exemplar texts and scaffolds to help facilitate student understanding and to save time. When I teach a new text type, I give students an exemplar which we annotate together for textual features. Then I give students a scaffold to plan a piece of their own that will include all of the textual features identified. I collect their planning and use that to help me figure out where students are weak so I can address that in future lessons. We'll do activities helping build those skills and then update our planning to show our new ideas. After the class is on track, they write their drafts and I collect those for more feedback and reteaching of skills if necessary.

I'd look at the common core standards for each grade and develop a logical sequence of what you could conceivably achieve in 6 or 8 lessons. Pick a skill to focus on each week (for example, if you're doing opinion pieces one week could focus on introductions and how to structure the piece, one week on how to include evidence effectively, one week on linking words to build the argument, and one week on conclusions). Then you've got the basic outline and you just have to come up with the cool activities.

I had fun with my students this year when I was trying to get them to use more effective description in their narrative writing - I brought lemon wedges to class, fed them to my students and then had the describe the whole sensory experience without using the words ""lemon"", ""yellow"" or ""sour"". Try to include some out-of-the-box activities like that to engage your students and help build their skills. "
highschoolteachers,"One point of clarification for wearing school colors/outfits.  I had a principal going through school who used to wear a letterman's jacket for our school all the time to rallies and sporting events.  It always felt weird and forced as a student - especially as he never went to our high school.  They tell me these days he's made superintendent so I suppose the parents thought he was worth his salt, but from the student side it was clear we could get away with everything."
highschoolteachers,"I have several students dealing with homelessness (my program works with at risk high school students, as well as those with different behavioral, cognitive, and emotional challenges). It's heart wrenching, and the last thing any student should be dealing with on top of other daily difficulties. 

Even if it doesn't work out to share your home, I think it's so important that you continue to provide what you've always done, a safe, structured ""normal."" Homelessness breeds a lot of uncertainties for what each day is going to bring (who's going to be sleeping near me, what kind of food will be available, what's going to happen with x y z). Therefore, providing a place where they can know what to expect is such a gift.

 Obviously, flexibility on your part is intuitive to adapt to what the student has to offer at each given class; however, to a less obvious but very important extent, continuing to hold a bar can help normalize and structure what their day looks like. This too can be a gift. "
highschoolteachers,"I taught seventh-grade, and I would give an extra-credit assignment that they could do or not. So it wasn't really homework, but they could use their math skills over break.

If I would have given homework over break it would have been frowned upon. We have no policy against it, and when my daughter was in high school her Literature teacher assigned two books to read and a couple of papers for homework, which was a real pain, but that was before the calendar change.

I don't think your assignment is a problem because I realize it can be done (and done well) in half an hour or so. But I bet you have parents who watch their children sit at the table, complain, put their heads down, complain, get a drink, complain, and drag it out much longer, and then complain about the enormous amount of time your assignment took."
highschoolteachers,"Alternative private school here - but my wife teaches public high school. Contrasting the two:

One has lots of paperwork and bureaucracy. The other has much more teacher discretion.

One has a customer service attitude towards even the difficult parents. The other one doesn't.

One has to put up with students who are totally unfit for school and horribly disruptive. The other can easily boot them.

One has tons of testing. The other has mandatory outside of school hours activities.

As you can see - there are trade offs to both. I definitely feel and my wife agrees that I am able to make much more of an impact on my students in the private setting. Benefits are better in public but the pay can be higher or lower in private, depending.


Hope that helps!

highschoolteachers,"I needed a math methods class to get certified for high school. I had everything else, I just needed the one class.

I did find a university close to where I lived (in Illinois, though) that was willing to let me take the class. So go ahead and email or call, and ask. "
highschoolteachers,"I entered college as an elementary special education major.  We had a ""student teaching"" program in my high school and I was placed with a second grade SpEd class and I LOVED it.

For a humanities-for-education-majors class we had to go to the Museum of Fine Arts and create a lesson plan around a painting.  I chose a sculpture based on Greek mythology.  Our next assignment was to go to the Boston Public Library and do the same.  I chose a special display on the Sacco and Vanzetti trial (it was like the 75th anniversary or something).

As I was writing this second LP I was like ""Hey. I like history.  A lot."" and went and changed my major.

I teach in a 9-12 high school but prefer 10-12 because 10-11 is US history and I like that best, and 12 is an elective I created, and I like that best too.  I'm not totally against teaching grade 9 occasionally though.

So... I guess I picked the age because of the topic."
highschoolteachers,"At first I wanted to be licensed k-12; but my college advisor told me if I wanted to do that - I'd be better off finishing ba and then doing ma for the other one and that I should pick one. It came down to elementary or high school (b/c you guys in middle school are a rare, awesome, special breed - that is NOT for me!). I ended up in elementary because I feel like they are still pretty malleable (and they can say the funniest damn things!)."
highschoolteachers,"Taught high school, didn't like it.  Kids were mostly set in their ways. Slept a lot..  Switched to middle school.  Love how excitable they are.  Love the ""I want to be independent but I also don't want to be"" of middle school.  

Try all of the grades you're interested in.  You'll get a good feel of where you want to be."
highschoolteachers,The limit for gifts in my state is $50- any more and we have to report/return it. Most of the time (high school English) I only get some chocolates or a mug. I'm kind of flabbergasted that people on the thread routinely get such expensive gifts! Cool for them but it blows my mind.
highschoolteachers,"I figured my high frequency of sarcasm and ability to jab back at kids who were being dicks was meant for nobody younger than high school.

My personal experiences that kids should and can learn from is definitely for an older crowd as well."
highschoolteachers,"So, I started TAPP in 2004 and lasted all of 3 months, until I turned in my key, along with a third of the other (veteran) teachers at the school where I was at. Obviously, it was a bad situation. After a year or so I returned to the world of education, but in a different way, and over the years I've found my niche. I know of several teachers going through TAPP programs right now, and it doesn't seem to have changed too much in the past decade.
SO, that being said, based on what you've written here and on the Atlanta thread (sorry, not trying to be a stalker) since you have not even subbed yet, I'm going to say that TAPP is not right for you at this point. TAPP ""prepares"" you for teaching at an awesome, well-funded school with smart, supportive admin, 21 kids in a class all reading around grade level who come from stables homes with involved parents. Those jobs exist. They are not hiring TAPP teachers. While this may not always be true, I'm going to go ahead and say that admins who hire unknown TAPP candidates are probably at least a little, if not a lot, desperate, and you need to know why they are desperate. 
This is not to say that TAPP is useless. I think that for people who have subbed a lot or worked as a para, it's feasible, because these people at least have an idea of the complexity of a classroom and a school and all the rules, regulations, and paperwork (and paperwork, and paperwork, and paperwork.) TAPP does not prepare you for that. For instance, one of the kabillion issues I had during my short stint as a 7th grade ELA teacher was dealing with the vastly different reading skills of the students. I'd have to go back through my TAPP materials, but differential teaching was barely mentioned, if at all, and there certainly was no information on what to do when a third is on grade level, a third is about at a 3rd grade level, and the last third is, essentially, functionally illiterate. There was one student who was repeating 7th grade for the 3rd time and he didn't know all of his letters. What do I do, what do I do, I'm asking everyone frantically. Make sure everything is read aloud and allow him to take tests verbally. Ok, those are examples of accommodations, yes, but knowing what I know now, and I'm cringing as I write this, that child should have had a paper trail a mile long, assessments, testing, interventions, support services, etc. If, for some odd reason, the student did have a lot of paperwork that the school was keeping from me, TAPP should have told me ""you need to go ask for x, y, and z reports"", since at the time I didn't even know all the terminology of what I needed, OR, if for some reason, a 15 yr old has seriously slipped through the cracks to the point of not knowing the alphabet, TAPP should have been telling me ""holy shit, you need to do this, this, and this to get the ball rolling to get him help.""
All that being said, keep in mind that TAPP is not the only way into the classroom.  Make GaPSC.com your new best friend. An Induction 4 non-renewable certificate is valid for 3 years, and if you check the site you'll see all the requirements for it being issued. You could start a M.A.T. degree part time, online and still keep your current job. If you subbed a lot and got in good enough with a school that they wanted to hire you, you could get your induction 4 cert, start a M.A.T.degree, your student teaching would be your job, and you would end up with a clear and renewable cert AND a master's degree, and the pay bump alone would almost cover the cost of the degree. There's a lot of ways you can do it, but you need to get in there and get your name known. Don't limit yourself to subbing just middle/high science, your true passion might be slightly different. And if you think you could possibly stand it, sub special ed a few times, because if you do go the sped route you can basically write your own ticket. It turns out that while I was a horrid 7th grade ELA teacher, I'm a really good high school science sped EBD teacher. 
And because I've already written a book, I'll add some more tips. Get great shoes and never sit down, because proximity solves 80% of classroom management problems. Discipline quiet, praise loud. If you're redirecting a kid, get close, get quiet, get calm, and state what they should be doing -- be quiet vs stop talking, take out a sheet of paper and turn to page xx vs. stop messing around. You do this quietly because you don't want to embarrass a kid in front of their peers. However, when it comes to praise, do it loud, do it often. One mistake I made going in was that I thought 7th graders would be too old to like praise. NOPE! Even 12 graders get off on it. How you do it depends on your personality type, but since I have no problems coming off as a little outrageous, I say stuff (loudly, so all students hear) like ""oh Jimmy look at you, with the hand raising and waiting patiently and quietly, you are a paragon of perfection"" or ""yes, yes, I love this, always do this, never stop doing this"" ""Beth, you are SOOOO on task your picture should be in the dictionary next to AWESOME."" Seriously, read up on PBIS, it's almost freaky what you can get students to do based on praise alone.
I think that's it for now, but let me know if you have any other questions."
highschoolteachers,"Went to uni for high school english but worked for a year as an EA in elementary and loved it so I applied for elementary positions. Was hired to teach a grade 1/2 split then a week before school started they told me I was going to teach high school english. 

My second year I applied somewhere else and was hired to teach grade 2. About two weeks after I signed the contract, they told me I'd be teaching grade 8. 

In my district your teaching certification is for all grades and all subjects so they can do this.


**tl;dr** I decided what grade I *wanted* to teach. Employer decided what grade I *would* teach.

edit: BTW I ended up loving middle years and have been in the middle for 21 of my 23 teaching years.
"
highschoolteachers,"Okay-- not sure where you are doing student teaching, but I teach high school English in Kentucky, so I hope this is helpful:

Objectives vs. objective statement: 
Objectives would be, for example, ""ACT Quality Core English 9 standard A2a -- Compare texts to previously read texts, past and present events, and/or content learned in other coursework.""
An objective statement would be an ""I can..."" or ""Students will be able to..."" statement. Using the above objective: ""I can compare the events in To Kill a Mockingbird to the American 1930s and the Jim Crow Era.""

Purpose of learning: does learning about the Mongols give students a context or a broader understanding of your main objectives: how areas were formed, how culture has changed, etc. I don't know much about the Mongols, but how does teaching about them align with any of your standards or objectives. Why is it worth spending time on, and what is the main takeaway?

Reteaching is for students who didn't get it based on your formative assessment, extension is for students who got it right away and need some sort of deeper or further learning. Closure/review is how you are going to wrap up and connect to your next topic, and how are you going to spiral that content (i.e. bring it up again later) in a different context so students don't just close the book on the Mongols and forget about it... because they are important, as you say.

Let me know if this doesn't make sense or you need anything else!

Also, congrats on passing your exams! Glad that stress is behind you."
highschoolteachers,"You can't take her to a therapist, so it sounds like you have to scaffold around her issues rather than going the direct path. 

What about looking at opinion through the lens of debate?  There are tons of debate orgs with materials out there for middle and high school students.  Having her do a pro/con case for different topics would force her to at least create an argument/opinion on a topic.  She doesn't have to choose the topic or the argument/opinion, she's just learning the process of forming an opinion with evidence.

Start with topics that are external - she does both sides, so doesn't have to choose one herself, she gathers information/research to back the claim, etc.  As she gets more comfortable with it, you can transition towards her choosing the side to argue or to issues where she backs it with life experience vs. external sources.

As for novels, you might try reframing discussion.  She doesn't know where to start if she's asked directly.  ""Some people think X about this character/scene/whatever.  What in the text might make someone form that opinion?""  rather than just what she thinks about something.  Give an opposite interpretation, look for information on that.  Then maybe ask her for which one she thinks is the best opinion/interpretation?  Might not get to that last step right away with how closed off she is."
highschoolteachers,"You have to consider race in this issue to some extent, even if you personally think that is not involved,  maybe because at the very least, they probably think that you have some sort of bias against them? My brother would always have stories when he was in middle school and high school about how his teachers just hated him and were out to get him, and he thought that they were all racist, which of course made his behavior a little worse in the whole situation. It turned out to be a vicious cycle, even if you think it's not an issue. From the sounds of your original comment, it seems like it is a factor that you really do need to visit. Have you pulled him aside and had a talk with them? To get their honest feelings on the situation?"
highschoolteachers,"I'm a high school teacher. This year was the first year of my career, and the first year my school offered all the subjects I taught. The only textbooks the students had access to was 10 years old, outdated and unorganised. The only resources I had was stuff I had from my university studies (which I had luckily not sold) and whatever I could scrounge from the internet (99% of which is crap that I had to sift through). 

I made everything from scratch, aside from the three sample assignments the government provides (which I had to change heavily anyway). 

No classroom teachers get paid six figures. Principals do, us grunts on the ground do not. 

I love my job, but it is not easy. Teachers fill the following roles every week (if not every day depending on the school): parent, counsellor, tutor, teacher, secretary, mentor, first aid nurse, cleaner and librarian. 

I can't say the same for university lecturers and tutors, but they work hard and don't get paid much either. "
highschoolteachers,"Thank you for your reply.  I talked to the boys together and explained to them how this is the kind of thing that might get them suspended or expelled. I stressed that even though no weapon was present, our urban high school has a very quick response to perceived threats."
highschoolteachers,"Fellow music teacher here. First off, I want to re-iterate and say that you are NOT a bad teacher. I don't think people understand how difficult it is to teach a music appreciation class to teenagers. It's not like you can just start with Gregorian chant and expect them to be super pumped about it. You basically have to come up with your own curriculum as the year progresses - in front of teenagers - not easy! Kudos to you for reaching out. 

I just want to share a couple of my 'greatest hits' lessons with my high schoolers and maybe they'll work for you. 
My school requires teachers to have a Do Now at the beginning of class. I had this question on the board: ""Is Classical music still relevant?"" We shared our answers. 
We then watched the music video for Nas ""I know I can"" and students were asked to identify the piano track he used (I let them use their phones)
We then listened to Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"". 
Next was Muse's ""Plug in, Baby"" where he uses Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D. 
We then discussed the value of music that lasts through the ages. The fact that Beethoven, born in 1770, is still relevant today says something about the lasting power of high quality music. The jury is still out to if we will be sampling Ke$ha in 200 years. 

Anyway, all that to say, just make it relevant to them. As soon as they understand why they are learning about all these old dead white guys, the more they'll be on your side. Hope this helps. 

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"The last several years, the students at my high school have been given fun activities to do (crafts and games and movies) at least the afternoon of the last day before Christmas break, if not the whole day.  The real reason behind this was the fact that grades were due at noon that day, and teachers needed the time to get all tests graded and semester grades finalized before Christmas break.  This year, we started late enough that our semester does not end until January 8th, a full week after we return from break.  Additionally, the students have been very vocal the last couple of years about not appreciating the fun times and they have been downright obstinate and rude when we've tried to find activities they'd enjoy.  So the teachers voted this year to have a regular class day on the day before break.  Word got out to the students, and they actually wrote a very nice letter and sent around a petition requesting the time at the end of the day to watch ""one Christmas-themed movie.""  We decided to let them have it, since they used appropriate channels to ask for it.  I'm thoroughly impressed.  I have told the students in my classes over and over again that they can't just loudly complain about the things they don't like (dress code and school lunch issues, mostly), they need to respectfully request change from the administration and work with those in charge to see if that change is possible."
highschoolteachers,"I'll start by saying yeah, that statement is condescending. 

I'm not saying it's not true but it is completely condescending. 

So my wife and I both teach and we have a child together. I personally don't feel like my experience as a parent doesn't affect my ability as a teacher very much. In fact it mostly affects it negatively as I never have time for either. But I have a two year old and teach high school so their isn't a lot of overlap. 

My wife on the other hand teaches second grade and she is of the opinion that there are some things that her colleagues simply don't understand because of lack of experience. Yes, insight is important but it doesn't cover everything which can be learned through experience. To me this just kind of make sense. It would be silly of me to pretend I completely understand something which I don't have experience of. That's why I listen to my female students, my black students, my disabled students because they might have experiences that I don't have insight to. 

Overall, yeah, when people say that to you they are being an asshole. But it is also worth talking to those parents to see if there is something there that you aren't seeing. "
highschoolteachers,"We have some on home-based too. Unfortunately, we can't keep them there long either. We do middle and high school, so our students are as tall as we are a lot of the time!  I have already been hit several times, bitten, stabbed with a pencil, and I'm going for an MRI on my knee tomorrow."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I went from a poor elementary school to a very ritzy high school last year. I replaced a legendary teacher last year and teach six different preps. Most of the other teachers don't even treat me kindly, I've heard them talking about how much better the old teacher was. He was there thirty years and I feel like it will take me some time to get really good at things! I am not very good with humor and actually have trouble reading sarcasm. I try to be kind, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I do notice teachers who have more humor and are slightly sarcastic do much better at this level. I did great with the elementary kids with my quiet calm demeanor, but I feel like it is not translating well at the high school level. If you have any advice on developing these or how to, I would really appreciate it. I really like my job overall and want to do the best I can for my kids. "
highschoolteachers,"Are these students in high school? I know junior high best, but I hope I can help.

You mention the music is music they can't stand to hear. What determines the music that is listened to in class? Is there a requirement for it to come from a particular time period/culture? Is it structured around any particular instruments? 

I would suggest looking at two things: relationship and curriculum. On the relationship front, invest some time in getting to know your students as people. Create something together. Have them teach you about something important to them. If it can be connected to music, that's great- the first song they ever downloaded, a favorite sound. Do some collaborative work as a class to establish the kind of environment that will help everyone work- what will help everyone maintain respect and an open mind? It sounds like your physical environment is a challenge too. Work with the students to figure out ways to edit your space to make it work for all of you.
On the curriculum front, have goals defined in terms of abilities students will have instead of content you will teach. In your orchestra class  the outcome is probably pretty clear: students will become better musicians, or will be able to perform a piece of music. There are probably other things though, like being able to work together as a team, or practice something until they get it right. Do those same goals apply in this class?
And hey, good on you for looking at what you can do to improve. You are going to learn so much from working with this class. If you want help thinking through any of this, I'm happy to be a sounding board."
highschoolteachers,"That sounds like a tough situation to be in; no one enjoys feeling that sort of tension when they're trying to do best by kids.

I'm hearing a few things bubble to the surface (for reference, my background is in teaching high school English and coaching/training high school teachers).

It's tough to tell if you're being ""played by the system."" A lot of that actually sounds like it's outside of your locus of control. Here's what it sounds like is within your control that could decide the course of action you take:

What type of ""support"" did the admin say they would give you? I think it's totally fine to ask them to deliver on that.

Additionally, are you able to contact the beginning teacher coordinator or any other sort of non-evaluative observer? Both your situation and your class could benefit if you were to ask for someone to come in and help you implement a Positive Behavior Intervention System. I think if you went to your admin and told them that this was something you were looking to do to improve your classroom and that you wanted an extra set of eyes to give you feedback on how it was going and what you needed to do to tweak it, then a few things in your favor would be happening:
1) You'd be actively showing (and documenting) that you're looking to do everything in your power to improve your classroom.
2) You'd be engaging the admin in that process and asking them to keep up their end of the ""support"" they promised you.
3) Most importantly, it sounds like your class would benefit from some positive culture building and incentives (based on the anecdotes you shared from current interactions with students).

Hope this helps!"
highschoolteachers,"First, I don't think it makes you an ""awful"" teacher.

However, I think 4 weeks is *far* too long for a writing assignment grade, yes. A rule of thumb is one assignment should be returned in advance of the next writing assignment in time for the student to see errors and make growth. This could be anywhere from 2 days to a week before, depending on length of assignment, needs of students, etc. A week before is ideal, but I know in AP English, we had short essays due weekly so that's obviously impossible. I also never had teachers who took more than a week to get me a writing assignment back (the end of the semester? Even before electronic grades, I would've been bothering my AP teacher every day if that happened to me in high school -- grades are important in high school; they're your future if you want to go to college because that's the system we have; the types of kids you're lucky enough to teach know that). 

Second, I'm unclear why you're working 50-55 hours on stuff besides grading with the population you have and prescribed curriculum you have. If pacing and curriculum are there for you and you have engaged learners who CARE about grades, the prep time should not be that long for lessons, assuming you get adequate prep (5 hours or so built into your 40ish-hour contract) per week and are then working 10-15 hours *on top* of that already? Prep is where you should have it easy, as well as classroom management and engagement. The students are engaged via grades (which is many a teacher's dream, ironically, but which you dislike -- I could go either way; I'm a pragmatist and I say ""Whatever works""). Additional engagement helps and is best practice, but if the school/kids/parents prioritize grading and feedback, so should you. Maybe sometimes let the other things slide and grade during your prep period instead? Maybe strike a better balance? You make it sound like you never grade writing during your prep. Why not? 

Also, I would focus more on grading things like Writing than participation/HW - though the latter may be easier already and not take much time away, I'm sure it adds up, no? 

Finally, if your rubric is clear, then I'd think you could easily defend your grading decisions, but I'm not sure if you're using a rubric that's unclear and prescribed for you. Perhaps that could be fixed if the rubric is the issue? You could collect papers for an anchor set for yourself and your students (for next year at least, if you've none from last year) and that may help long-term. 

You could also find another teaching assignment with a different set of kids who aren't as grade-motivated where the rigor isn't as high and the grading isn't as massive. In those placements, classroom management and designing engaging lessons would be the primary challenges vs. grading and nitpicking by parents. "
highschoolteachers,"Do not blame yourself personally, just consider it a bit of a right of passage, blame your new-ness.  Most teachers experience extreme challenges in the first years.  I am first year but a career changer, so I am old enough to be their parent, and in one of my classes the high school girls still whisper ""bitch"" under their breath.  I recognize that this is less about me and my dedication, but more about me and my inexperience.  I am over 40, and a parent of a teen, but always feel like the newbie who can't get it 100% under control!

Yes, some students are great with other teachers because they (the teachers) know how to deal with it, and nip attitude in the bud.  But there are other teachers who these kids hate and will never have peace in their classroom!  

I have kids who love me and some who hate me.  I keep at it...in fact in high school, I am starting January taking cell phones away after the 1st warning.  I expect trouble for the first few weeks, but it's part of the gig!

Oh, and there shouldn't be awkward stigma. Just own it like you teachers are just learning from each other, and as a newer college graduate, you come in with the latest and greatest ideas!

My 4th period is almost a total loss for 30% of the kids, I try to maintain control to give to the other 70% a chance to shine.  Not a perfect year, but I don't expect perfection!

Maybe your last period is your fault, or maybe not, but you are ready to make it better!  It will keep getting better because you can take constructive criticism as a learning tool and adjust as necessary. 

I have a kid who throws himself to the floor in 3rd period and likes to scream inappropriate things to make kids laugh. There is only so much I can do...Keep Moving Forward!!!"
highschoolteachers,"First of all, does your daughter have a 504/IEP? These give her legal protection (assuming she is at a public, U.S. school). But really I do not have good enough background information to understand what is going on... what are the teacher's complaints?

A note: NEVER use spy cams! Are you kidding? Not only is this an extreme response but it is super illegal! You can not record people without their permission (usually) and you can NEVER EVER record children without their parents' permission! This ""idea"" of yours in general makes me hesitant to offer you serious advice. It's a crazy leap for you to make.

My suggestion would be to wait this out (or even home school her for the remainder of the year if you absolutely can not handle it) and send her to a different high school.

eta: I see it is a Catholic school and I have no idea how those work in terms of disability protection. You may want to move to public where she will be protected under the law."
highschoolteachers,"Catholic school teacher here. Yes, sounds like the faculty may have significant concerns they can't continue to serve your daughter. We can do a great job for disabled students in elementary and middle school with individualized accomodations, but we don't have the resources to do that for high schoolers and situate them well for college. I think you need to have a straightforward conversation with the administration about your what your goals for you daughter are for high school and beyond and whether the school is a good fit. "
highschoolteachers,"She should be tested, but there is no need to rush - she is still very young, and testing kids that young is quite a task (one that I'm not accustomed to having come from high school).  

I would probably encourage giving the full battery of testing by the end of her 1st grade year. 

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"This is where I'm probably not going to be as much help, haha.  I'm new to elementary gifted (I was a high school gifted teacher for 5 years but moved to elementary this year due to some changes in our programs) so you're probably better versed in the types of assessments specific to elementary, particularly in K.  I'd think a lot of that isn't necessarily specific to gifted, as you mentioned before, in determining her level of reading, etc.

But as far as specific gifted testing, we use the Cognitive Abilities Test (all sections), the Naglieri nonverbal, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, and generally the Stanford 10 achievement test.  We use a few other things but those are the big ones.  

A score in the 90% rank or higher in these areas generally indicated giftedness.  96% on the COGAT and 90 and above on the others.

"
highschoolteachers,"In elementary, especially in the younger grades, you're very much in a parent role a lot of the time: making sure they eat healthy snacks, helping out with stuck zippers, untying knots, resolving friendship problems, etc.  Coming directly from high school or middle school that was frustrating to me at first, but now that I understand the needs of younger children better and have adjusted my exoectations, it's a part of the job that I enjoy.  

Younger kids from K-Grade 5 don't give any of the attitude of older students.  They buy in to whatever lessons you have planned 110% and they really like their teachers.  It's a lot of fun and you see a lot of growth in a year, which is incredibly satisfying.  The lower the grade you teach, the more growth and change you tend to see in a year.  For me personally, the best age is 8-10 year olds.  They're can do a lot on their own, yet they're still very keen to learn and are interested in school.

I haven't taught as much high school (just during my teaching practicum), but I found that it was very much more subject-focussed so planning is much, much easier.  Marking also seemed easier (though English might be heavy), since marks are based using a percentage system instead of the holistic approach used (rightly) in elementary.

Middle school is my idea of hell -- the worst of both worlds.  I don't need the attitude."
highschoolteachers,"Former juvenile detention teacher here. I sincerely loved many of my students but some were just downright scary and I wouldn't have wanted to be in the classroom without guards present.  If a student is threatening your life,  take it seriously!  He/she might just be posturing, but why take a chance?  Some of these kids are mentally ill and not getting the proper treatment and some are just pissed off at the world and looking for any opportunity to let off some aggression.  Some honestly want to do real prison time to earn respect from their peers. I would shudder at the thought of some of the kids I dealt with being sent back to ""real"" classrooms! But they were. Not all, but definitely some would not be in school at all if it wasn't part of probation and he/she wasn't wearing a monitor. I also subbed regularly at a public high school and heard that MANY times (usually as the excuse for why they refused to do any work). 

 My point is, just because they are legally still children doesn't mean they can't do very serious damage--up to and including actual murder. We had one seemingly NICE kid who was in for attempted murder. He followed a woman home and then attacked her on her doorstep with a knife,  ""just to see what it would feel like to kill somebody. ""  Fortunately she survived and he will be locked up for a little while,  but not long enough, imo!  

My suggestion would be to document the incident in writing,  present it to an administrator and if they don't take of it in a timely and appropriate manner, take it to your union. Also, ask the student who his probation officer  is and see if that doesn't make him stop and think for a moment! You can also get that information from the school and personally contact his probation officer. He/she should be able to have some influence or at least inform you on the level of credibility a threat from one of his/her clients has to it. "
highschoolteachers,"It's sad to hear you were in such a terrible situation. I am in an Alt Ed high school and I know how hard it can be sometimes. My girlfriend is on the verge of quitting her teaching job too. Just remember that this is YOUR life, and nobody here can answer your last question except for you. 

I know the inner-city game too, and if you want to sub, good god that's like all the problems you currently have but multiplied by 10. Woof. "
highschoolteachers,"Long Reply.

So I'll start with parent advice first, then move to academic support advice.  Background, my son was a non-reader in the third grade, and it made every subject hard for him.  Additionally, he was so humiliated that he felt stupid that he was beginning to just refuse to do work.  He eventually became a reader, now really enjoys it.  I now teach high school and see 1st hand the emotional toll being illiterate has on an adolescent.

Mom needs to realize that he needs strong love and support, first and foremost.  He is likely very self aware and just tired of feeling like a failure. For a 6th grader, I would probably try graphic novels (comic books) because reading is reading.  Graphic novels have fewer words and provide images that help the student understand the content. Additionally, reading to mom is a good thing, but she isn't a reading specialist, so he may have other reading issues that ""practice"" can't fix. But she should let him read things to her that he wants to. It's hard to be interested in the things that 12 year old boys like, but he needs to read, and if he wants to read you the ""silly"" part of what just read, let him.  Help him with his homework. Have him help her cook and read the recipe to her. Teach him how to Google on mom's smartphone and have him look things up for her when she is ""busy"". Get him anything that he is interested in reading: Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Comic Books, Video Game review books, Minecraft tutorial books, ANYTHING.  Big point here - Make sure he knows that as long as he is trying, she isn't concerned about his grades. She just needs him doing his part at school and attempting, because he is SMART, SMART, SMART!! Kids need to know that their parents truly believe they can succeed!

Now for school...It is said, throughout education, that in the early grades (Kinder - 3rd) students are ""Learning to Read"", beyond that they are ""Reading to Learn"", so now, the lack of reading is impacting every other subject.  Even if he doesn't like his math teacher, the reading is also impacting his ability to do math.  

If you are in the US your friend should request that her son be evaluated for a learning disability.  If it is determined that there is a disability, then the student should be able to receive reading intervention service and other types of assistance to help him ""get"" the content. Mom should talk to her son honestly about being evaluated, tell him to do his best and try not to give up so they can figure out how to best help him.  Mom is his first teacher, and his #1 advocate.  Not knowing what his elementary experience has been, I can't criticize the teaching, and kids get really good at hiding their non-reading...like CRAZY GOOD, but it sounds like he got left behind somewhere and that isn't his fault!  

Mom just needs to realize that she is in it for the next 6-7 years to get him graduated, so she needs to be prepared to be the one consistent voice of advocacy that he has.  Teachers have 30 - 120 kinds or more to follow daily, Mom has 1.  

I hope this is helpful."
highschoolteachers,"I went to somewhat of an alternative high school my last two years. It was part of a community college, so you could get college credits for some of your classes, which appealed to a high achiever like myself. It also allowed for Fridays ""off"", which meant no school unless you needed tutoring. As you can imagine, the people there ranged from burn outs with no interest in school to high achievers like myself that'd end up being in on Fridays to get additional support. I saw a lot of people complain about school being boring and stupid to my teachers, but for those of us who actually loved school, I hope it made it worth it to them. 

I do hope your situation gets better. Being undervalued in the workplace is a horrible feeling, especially as a new parent."
highschoolteachers,"It's for students who dropped out of high school and are coming back to get their GED. Students range between 19-60 years old and all come from high poverty areas. My program doesn't keep attendance and almost all teaching happens one-on-one. No classroom management, no annoying parents, just general education for those who want it. Only problem is the pay "
highschoolteachers,"I had a sneezing, coughing (male, high school) student tell me yesterday, ""I would have stayed home today, but the maids were coming."""
highschoolteachers,"For what it's worth, you could also think about the non-academic differences too. I imagine elementary teachers spend at least some time wiping snotty noses, helping kiddos unbuckle a belt to go potty, tying tennis shoes, etc. All things a high school teacher literally never does. However, the occasional high school fight is way more terrifying than its elementary counterpart and usually ends in handcuffs, so there's that too. "
highschoolteachers,"I was hospitalized for psychiatric reasons twice in my first few years. I have struggled with anxiety and depression all my life. I cut for about 10 years in high school and college, had eating disorders, panic attacks, substance abuse, I was a mess. That's not saying that I don't still have issues, but... being a teacher is the best thing that ever happened to me.

I *had* to force myself to be there for the kids. I went from having major crying, hyperventilating panic attacks to now being able to keep a level head in incredibly tense situations. I went from not knowing how to escape the fog and misery of depression to being able to cope and function despite those feelings, or at least how to work around them.

I'm not saying that teaching is right for you. What I'm saying is, there is hope, and you don't have to regard your mental illness as a permanent destiny. Maybe, in the course of time, with a new job and a few more years' experience in learning about yourself and managing your mental health, you will reach a place where you are healthy and ready to give it another try. And if not, that's fine too! It's not for everyone. Top priority is your health and happiness.

Best of luck, and good for you for recognizing and acknowledging where you're at. What you're doing isn't easy."
highschoolteachers,"It required a lot more patience for me to work with younger kids. I did my masters in reading and language arts, and I had a few practicum experiences with them...they're way cuter and more fun once they're into something, but you lack the depth of understanding that you get from high schoolers. High schoolers can really connect with something (like one year I gave a pair of bright students copies of No Exit and The Stranger and they LOVED Existentialism and Absurdism). You can't get that from a 9 year old. 

So for me, older students were where it was at when it came to really enjoying what I was doing. 

It comes down to your preferences. 

Also it kills me that middle school is a gray area. Honestly middle school is its own animal and should be taught and selected as such...it's SUCH a dramatic difference from elementary and high school both. "
highschoolteachers,Try to find some people that aren't on your team.  Look for the staff that are usually pretty happy and can be positive even if things aren't going well.  I was in a very similar situation for my past two years.  I ended up just finding a good group of people that have fun with their career.  Remember they don't always have to be people on your team.  I work in an elementary school and have great relationships with teachers in the high school.  
highschoolteachers,"These are just from my experiences, obviously not a blanket for all.

High schoolers are obviously much more independent. They can do a lot on their own with help and guidance as needed. Elementary kids need a lot more instruction and clarification, small steps at a time. I started off with high school and moved to elementary and am still adjusting to what they know and are capable of, I tend to overestimate it. I forget they are little tiny people with limited experiences and prior knowledge and I assume too much. 

Both have their difficulties as far as instruction goes. The content gets harder the older they get, but I feel as though instructional strategies get harder they younger they are. 

Behavior wise, high schoolers tend to be much more defiant and apathetic. Younger kids don't misbehave to be jerks, they just can't.sit.still.

Middle school can be fun if you can deal with the hormones. I personally prefer elementary because of what I get to do with my subject (library), but in a lot of ways middle school is the best of both worlds. They are old enough to be somewhat independent, but still young enough that they enjoy fun silly stuff without thinking it's lame (to an extent obviously). "
highschoolteachers,"ELA is an easier subject in general, and therefore easier to teach to students. It's ridiculous to suggest that all subjects are equally difficult. There's a reason STEM degrees are more valuable, almost universally considered more difficult, and finding highly qualified teachers in many of these fields is difficult since there are many better paying options. 

Let's face facts, anyone with an advanced degree in a hard science could passably teach high school ELA, but I don't think many advanced English degree holders could competently teach a STEM subject like physics or calculus."
highschoolteachers,What would you say is a good classroom environment for high school students versus middle school students?
highschoolteachers,What sort of personality would you say is good for teaching middle school versus high school? I'm making the decision myself. 
highschoolteachers,"I've only ever taught in elementary school. I find that I'm taller than they are and listen to me more than I think high schoolers would. I also get to teach all subject areas, not just one or two.  "
highschoolteachers,"Fellow Metro Detroit teacher here, and I feel your pain. I cannot even count the amount of fights we've had this year, one of which was in my classroom. 

There's more than one reason as to why there's a teacher shortage in Detroit schools (charter and public). The pay and the students are beyond abysmal. Frankly, the kids are animals and as a high school teacher- they're just dangerous. 

Hang in there. Find a better teaching job with administration that supports you. This could very well be just a bad experience, but don't give up hope. "
highschoolteachers,"We agree content area knowledge is crucial. However, I would assume most teachers have that before they undertake a Masters. In fact, in Secondary Education, I find that content area knowledge is very rarely the area that teachers are lacking (and I've mentored teachers in every subject area) compared to their abilities to manage classrooms or motivate students. Additionally, motivated teachers can often teach themselves content area knowledge if needed with the resources available. 

&gt;If they have a master's in their subject area, that's basically a guarantee that they are comfortable with high school level calculus/algebra/physics/chemistry/biology.

I have not found those with Masters degrees (though, to be fair, I've met very few teachers with pure content STEM degrees or pure content anything else degrees) have a higher degree of content knowledge or that STEM teachers typically struggle with their content knowledge. I have not found this to be a high area of need. In fact, Science and Math departments seem to hire people with very high degrees of subject knowledge where I am. The issue is usually more their ability to convey said knowledge or manage a class. "
highschoolteachers,"Gosh, I'm sorry to hear you're having a miserable time at it. I have to tell you, if you are in a toxic work environment anywhere (education, healthcare, engineering, etc.), you are going to feel the exact way. I know, I've been in horrible working situations and absolutely wanted to give up. Have you thought about a district change? Many of my teacher friends stress a lot of your satisfaction has to do with the district, which I know isn't always something you can choose when looking for work. If you are holding out until the end of the year, you absolutely have time to start applying, though! 

That said, as a taxpayer - thank you for working in a less than great school district. Those kids need good teachers, even if many of them act like monsters. Teachers are some of the most unappreciated group of workers in the country for the work they do and are unfairly blamed for a failing education system. I absolutely despise standardized tests (I was an anxious, severely depressed high schooler) and think it's outrageous teachers are evaluated on them. I was just about give up on dreams of college due to my lower than expected ACT and SAT scores until my English teacher gave me the confidence to retake it and continue on. I think if I even helped one kid in my entire career the way I was helped, it'd be worth it.

I completely understand and have heard many stories from current coworkers who just burnt out and couldn't handle it anymore, especially the administration side of education. That said, I'm making an okay salary for my background and education but working about 10 to 12 hour days plus weekends (like you said - the work is never done) with little chance of upward mobility; I'm just not cut out for corporate greed and what it takes to get to the top. The only thing at the moment that is giving me hope that I won't become another cog in the corporate machine is teaching someday."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;So you think ELA content is immaterial and easier to teach? 

That is defensive and accusatory. No, I said nothing of the sort. 

The fact you feel content-area master's don't matter is a bit puzzling to me. I ascribed it to the fact that maybe your teaching ELA made your experience different from mine and that of many other teachers I know; I realized they're mostly STEM.

You have many people teaching science and math that don't really know it that well, maybe barely skated by in their undergraduate degree. That's a fact.

If they have a master's in their subject area, that's basically a guarantee that they are comfortable with high school level calculus/algebra/physics/chemistry/biology.
"
highschoolteachers,"While all I have to go on is what you tell us, I think part of your decision is ""right."" If you're working in a charter, it's odd that you are told you are ""on your own."" Charters typically have an exorbitant amount of procedures for students and teachers to follow, which theoretically is why they are relatively successful with the population we work with. I work is a public high school very similar to your population. 

The fights you're describing, if all by the same student, are certainly not your fault. That student should have been expelled already, as charter schools are a privilege, so to speak. Even in a standard public school, that child would been expelled at that point. 

It seems you're in a really bad school with poor leadership, in an already tough district. The only reason I made it through my first year at my tough spot was because of the guidance and support of my leadership. 

I wouldn't leave the field entirely. I'd try again somewhere fresh, or sub for a bit (although I presume subbing is one of the toughest jobs really). You have a point about not leaving mid year because it leaves a bad impression.

 Is there someone you trust and look up to in your school who is familiar with all the specifics that you can go to for advice? I certainly hope so. Or maybe see a therapist who has experience speaking with people in the teaching profession. My therapist used to teach in my exact position in my district for like 20 years before changing careers, and I stumbled across her all accidentally. She's the greatest and totally gets me and my stressors. 

Best of luck. PM me if you want to talk or ask me questions. Again, I work in one of the toughest districts too. My school is like what The Wire was based off of, or at least that's what we all joke :) "
highschoolteachers,"Hi!
Thanks for your advice. I am currently teaching in a similar, terrible situation high school. I have no resources (I have to make all of my resources to teach history content to ESL newcomers and SLIFE students) and the students are so disrespectful because they have no idea how to work in a classroom (Most have only been to half-day schools). 

My boyfriend is working as a School Psychologist in Rutherford county, so we would be looking in that area. Your advice is good, and I know about the poor treatment of teachers in NC (I have done research), but it might be necessary to move anyway :(

I'll be used to the teacher abuse, but with a $12,000 pay cut it seems

What grades do you teach ESL to?"
highschoolteachers,"I don't know what the answer is.  I was just like you when I was in high school, and that is the reason why I wasted 5 years trying to become a teacher.  Now that I've started, I wish I had done something else with my education.  As a teacher, these problems continue to exist, and now I 100% understand why your teachers just go through the motions the way that they do.  You can try talking to your teachers about it, but I can't guarantee it will be successful.  Part of the problem is the workload of teachers.  People like me wanted to go in to make a change, but guess what?  Your evaluations as a teacher are based on performance on standardized tests.  Teaching to the test is not an effective way of fostering learning, but when your job depends on it, people do it.  I know I'm probably not all that helpful here, but maybe I can help you understand why your teachers are doing this.  "
highschoolteachers,"I'll be student teaching starting in Jan. I have an Electrical Eng. degree which I never used in the field (other than a little IT work that didn't really use what I learned). I fell into doing remodeling and carpentry for the last 6-7 years. I enjoyed myself and mastering different skills was very satisfying but my source of work is retiring and I have no desire to run my own business. Also I'd like to use the degree I spent all that time and money on. 

I've been back at school part and recently full time for several years.  It has been a challenge to keep up with school, home life, and working to pay the bills. I have a 2 year old and another kid on the way.  I'm in my mid 30s so I know a bit about changing careers.  I would say your level of challenge with the transition will greatly depend on what else is going on with your life.  
 
I can't speak to the actual having a job part (though my mother taught elementary, my father was a college football coach and he taught kinesiology, and I have several friends who are public school teachers, so I at least hear plenty of ""are you sure you know what you're doing"" speeches along with the ""it was so great when"" stories.)

If you really have a passion for teaching, you will enjoy methods classes and theories of learning. You'll probably have to take some psych classes related to child development, special Ed, etc.  Degree requirements can be very different from the cert requirements, but I'm sure you know how to explore that. 

I would also echo the ""get into a classroom"" sentiment.  You said you plan to already but I would add that you want to go outside your comfort zone as much as possible. Try to observe grade levels you never thought you'd want to teach.  I went into all of this with a few bad experiences with younger kids at summer camps and such.  Meanwhile I had great experiences with high school kids in other situations, so I pictured myself as a HS teacher.  Fast forward to now and I've spent nearly 100 hours in middle school classrooms and it's completely different than I imagined (in a good way). 

Take every opportunity to work with kids in different situations. 1 on 1, small groups, etc. As the others mentioned, the classroom is totally different than a tour.  Make sure to observe how things change during the day (before vs after lunch, etc) and during the week (Monday vs Friday), and if you can, get some context with the whole year. If you observe the week before Thanksgiving it's a lot different than if you're in a room in September or March. 

Speaking of those 100 hours I mentioned, they were a requirement of my program. We got 60 in two chunks from classes and were responsible for 40 on our own. So, make sure you get some sort of proof/signature/etc that you were in a classroom and working with age appropriate kids. It might save you a ton of time later. 

Anyway, the biggest difference between a museum tour and a classroom is that TEACHING IS NOT TELLING. You feel good about all the stuff you said after a tour. Some students probably ask interesting questions, so you think that means they're learning. Nope. Not necessarily. Maybe that one kid did but maybe they have a misconception as well.  The hardest thing to do is to find and create lessons that allow the students to construct their own knowledge.  You will be managing and shaping HOW they do that.  To relate it to museums again, the kids probably learn more from well designed exhibits than they do from you talking.  Reading, touching things, making their own connections...relating what they know to what you want them to explore...that's where it happens. 

Anyway you may know some of that already and I didn't mean to sound harsh at the end there. Just figured I'd point out some common misconceptions people have about classrooms that come from their own experiences. Because we all have lots of experience with lecture and similar situations, we sometimes mistake that for being responsible for learning. 
"
highschoolteachers,"I got one. 

So it's my second or third year teaching. I'm in ESL, so I don't often get to go on field trips. They're rare in the first place so when someone asks me to go, I go. 

I'll preface with most of my students are refugees. So they're coming from multiple countries and I don't speak, say, Burundi all that well. So we have to get creative with instructions. A lot of miming and pictures and other scaffolds. After a little over a year, they have the basic vocabulary down to have the workings of a conversation.

So we had a deal for a couple years where each grade was able to take a trip to the zoo during the off season. It was one of those deals where they have a couple lessons, pet the iguana, dissect the owl turd, etc.

Everything is going well until they bring out the big, hairy spider. Personally, I'm alright with snakes and most bugs. But spiders are freaky deaky. They have hair and spit and move their bodies with their heart, that's a big ol' ball of nope for me. I'm not afraid and I get the spiders out of the house for my wife all the time, but I ain't touching them either. So I check on all my newcomer kids and do my best miming technique of ""Touch? No touch? Thumbs up thumbs down. Okay, no touch."" So I took care of that. 

Now what I should have done is checked on this kid who had been in the states almost two years. This kid was pretty bright, had a good deal of basic English before he came, the schools in his host country were pretty solid, and he was doing well with us. So I thought at least ""Spider? No, thank you."" was in his repertoire. Well, he got the idea across when flung that big, hair spider straight up in the air.

Pan. De. Monium. Kids are running everywhere, jumping on top of tables, screaming, chairs flying, no one knows where the spider is. Just... wow. And these are sixth graders. One or two of them have already had their growth spurt and are, like, already 180 lbs. So there was a lot of big movement quickly.

I am not helping. The problem for me wasn't the spider. It was the fact that, despite having a number of advanced degree, I never really graduated from being a high school sophomore. I'm turning red with laughter. I'm crying and dry heaving it was so funny. It was just too much. After like 30 seconds (a really long 30 seconds), I collect myself and help get the kids to calm down, help find the spider (who luckily had not had a little spider heart attack or was stepped on), and get the room back in order. After that, I suggested we move straight to the tour.

So to this day I swear that kids half did that on purpose. Who throws a spider straight up in the air? It's going to come back down, and probably on you. And at this point that kid had the faculties to say ""No."" I asked him that day and a couple of times a few years after, ""What in the world were you thinking?"" I get the same answer every time ""I don't know"" and then he giggles. That kid knew. 

Oh, well, it was funny as shit."
highschoolteachers,Some of our elementary schools are doing this and then selling the produce. I think it's awesome and wish we had something like that at the high school level (or I should say at my high school). Also bonus points on the name-love that movie!
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Since when does a percentage outweigh student understanding?

Since society has decided (incorrectly) that they are the same thing basically and assigned a host of consequences to students, teachers, and schools to get those numbers where they want them, all while falling behind. 

I don't know how you fix this. I know I have my little ways of rebellion, as a teacher, but they are small. Tiny. Insignificant. They won't really *change* anything. And, at the end of the day, I'll still be judged on those percentages. Since I teach middle school, I can protect my kids somewhat from the mentality but not entirely. In high school, I'm sure that becomes impossible.

What can a student do? Nothing, just you one. But if you could make other students your age understand the issue, truly understand it, then maybe we could get somewhere. It would take time, a movement for systemic change. I don't know how that happens. I think in the meantime all we have are small islands of shelter and refuge in the numerical sea. "
highschoolteachers,I would like to echo what has already been said about observing a few classes first. I will tell you that if your program is anything like my program than your in for a lot of work. I'm currently working towards my credential to teach high school biology and the coursework for my program is very challenging. In fact I'm procrastinating on my Teacher Performance Assessment as we speak cause I've been working on it all day. There is a lot of work ahead of you and it doesn't stop after you get your credential. All I can tell you is if you enjoy teaching than it's worth it. There is no greater feeling than watching your students understand a concept that you have been beating your head against a wall trying to teach them. Education is worth the work and if your having fun then it's like you're not even working. 
highschoolteachers,"As a former music kid as much as I love the extra stuff for music, the entire school should not be pushed into that secluded little world. It messed with dynamics when we got the thugs struggling to play twinkle twinkle little star.

We had science league in high school. It was different schools competing but  you could break up the school into teams and do that. We took tests over a certain course, like chemistry or physics. At some point we got these awesome free cookies. You can guess why people went.

It was relatively relaxed. It wasn't prep for high stakes testing but it still really helped if you did have test anxiety. It was like a game. I don't see why it couldn't be done with other subjects and even rotated and done kind of like trivia "
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the input! Absolutely agree with you - museum tours are completely different than teaching. I have, however, noticed in each of my professional positions and in college, I gravitate towards education and curriculum development. I excel best when working with and teaching others, and I do think teaching is the career path for me.

I have time scheduled to shadow at a local high school and have heard plenty of horror stories from friends of not being able to find a teaching position/stuck subbing. I believe I have a bit of an advantage as I bring real world experience and also have a resume that displays a professional career already. Worst case scenario, I wouldn't be as hard pressed to find a position to support myself with my professional background. Hopefully it wouldn't come to that, though.

From my research I've came to the conclusion social studies and language arts are pretty saturated fields, but I have also read plenty that having endorsements for both would give a leg up. I could also easily obtain endorsements for journalism and anthropology, although from what I've seen, there hasn't been a high school to offer anthropology as an elective. I wish I had the coursework for teaching math or science, but those introductory level courses were murder at my university."
highschoolteachers,"Environmental clubs from what I've seen aren't that great.

What about home economics? The idea of free food appeals to everyone. Or even a shop class. I wish my school had clubs that could help me in real life.

My high school had Model UN and it really changed me for the better"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school so there's no way I can do gifts for all 150+ of the students I teach. This year (my sixth teaching) was the first time I did any gifts, in fact - I gave my graduating Year 12s each a small present (our school year starts in January and finishes in December). Because there were only a few of them, I made a small gift for each student and wrote each of them a card. In the past, I haven't even written cards - when I was teaching 50+ graduating Year 12s the idea was overwhelming. 

Don't feel pressured to do a gift for your students just because last year's teacher did. A little bit of candy and a card would be more than enough.

For other staff members... I've only received a few Christmas gifts from colleagues, and the card that came with them was always the thing I appreciated most. If you've got people who have helped you a lot, write them a card and get them a little something that relates to their likes and interests. For example, this year I got a notebook, a nerdy keyring and some tea from a colleague and I was really touched."
highschoolteachers,"My mother was a high school math teacher for 35 years.  If I was hired tomorrow, I would make more than her in one year as she did in her 35th year.  Part of this is inflation and pay scales."
highschoolteachers,There's a teaching shortage in this country - you'll get hired.  The advice I got from my teachers in high school was get your masters ASAP.
highschoolteachers,"Thank you so much for real. School has always been hard for me. I was diagnosed with ADD in elementary school and I dropped out of high school my senior year. This is part of why I want to teach actually because I know there are kids that really struggle and I want to help if I can. 

Making this decision is still hard for me I almost wish someone would just force me to do it because motivation can be hard for me. But I know I need to start this process. "
highschoolteachers,"Honestly, you'll probably have to take the Spanish Classes.  Most colleges require that you take at least 2 high school level foreign languages (which is silly in your case.)  But there it is.

Spanish classes are often pretty fun, although I took French when I was in school.

EDIT:  If you aren't college bound, you PROBABLY don't need the foreign languages."
highschoolteachers,"I agree - also, look online and see if you can find an independent ""close reading"" activity perhaps?  These are usually good for a few days because it involves the students reading a text several times in order to answer different information/find deeper meaning.  There are a lot of pre-made units out there involving this. 

I would plan a movie/documentary for Friday.  Also, cheesy as it sounds, I had a sub who handed out subject based coloring sheets and it was the greatest day of high school ever.  We had to color then and then write a paragraph or two on how the picture related to what we were learning.  Ate up a whole class, but it was fun to color."
highschoolteachers,Really? I've been kind of back and forth on middle and high school. 
highschoolteachers,"I totally thought middle school would be impossible for me, so I went to high school. Now, i'm teaching both in an alternative school. These middle schoolers are pretty bad, but I bet the kids in regular ed are pretty fun."
highschoolteachers,"This seems to be a perpetual statement that the education system is broken that students are getting a raw deal and teachers are treated as martyrs in a world where the almighty dollar rings.
( you're going to have to interpret my talk-to-text because this is too much to type on mobile)
I fell into teaching I earned a journalism degree from State University in Texas and ended up taking a job as an aid while I was looking for jobs as a News writer and fell in love with the classroom and working with students. It was a special education classroom and I have two women who were extremely conservative and religious who had been there for years one of them was there for at least 30 and they were handing out these incredibly thick packet of worksheets to the special education students who ranged in age from kindergarten to sixth grade and it was mind-numbingly silent in that classroom always one of them was constantly on her email she was the primary teacher and looking to retire in the next couple of years pretty much just riding the wave the other was another age and had a daughter in fifth grade at the school they were from Oklahoma the husband work at Verizon. I'm not really worried about giving too many specifics because there is no way that they use Reddit. 
 One day one of our students who was the 6th grader was on the computer and totally sucked into something interesting and he was looking up ancient Egypt and the Pharaohs. I decided to join him and we spent at least half an hour looking up different websites and talking about the history of the kingdom and so many things Way Beyond what any other 6th grader would be interested in and the other is that I work with said to him quote okay it's time to get back to work now.
 I almost lost it. I told her he was working comma he was doing more work than she had given him in months. And her response was I need something to grade.
 I was so taken aback that I didn't even respond. I just thought to myself I cannot let people like this teach our children. And I became a full-time teacher and got my own classroom and I've been teaching for 7 years.
 The pay is good the benefits are good I have more time off than any of my friends have plenty of autonomy in my classroom to teach what I want how I want and fortunately I teach electives in high school so I am strictly evaluated based on my students performance and what they produce I think a lot of core teachers have a hard time being able to push back on administrators and District Personnel because their product is a standardized test. If they took a more project-based learning approach and have something outside of the test to say okay this student didn't perform well on a standardized test but look at what they're able to create then I think you would see a shift the problem that I see primarily an education is to many employees who either feel they have it tough or just clock in and out and don't realize what they're actually doing for a career at this isn't a job in a cubicle where you process 8 hours worth of data and go home to your family. It doesn't work like that you have to understand what you're getting into before you become a teacher. I see a lot of people who want to change careers and leave teaching I feel lot of people who want to change careers and become teachers and most are doing it for the wrong reasons I think that you don't need to see teaching as a calling to be a natural for it but you have to have a passion for Learning and teaching and sharing and be open and flexible and if you do that you'll be successful butt it's a business just like everything else and there are politics and there are people that want you to do less with more. Personally I drive because I am brace that Underdog mentality teach my children to do less with more and we constantly come out on top because of that are advertising for the yearbook is funny and cheap and cheesy and we take a cue from Adult Swim in in that and our book is geared towards what students want which is lots of really good photos that they can take because they don't have the skills instead of trying to win contests our newspaper is driven by the students ideas not by what the teacher or the administrators want them to do and we went to work because of it because we do our thing and we create community and culture I see a lot of people that complain that aren't happy with their situation as teachers it's tough especially if you have administrator that don't like you but Enclave for me easier than any other job stability was consistency.

Personally I Drive because I am brace that underdog mentality I teach my children to do less with more and we constantly come out on top because of that our advertising for the yearbook is funny and cheap and cheesy and we take a cue from adults Swim in in that and our book is geared towards with students want which is lot of really good photos that they can take because they don't have the skills instead of trying to win contest our newspaper is driven by the students ID is not by what the teacher or the administrators want them to do and we went to warrants because of it because we do our thing and we create community and culture I feel lot to people that can plan that aren't happy with their situation is teachers its tough especially if you have administrators that don't like you but on flights for me easier than any other job stability wise consistency my just deal with teenagers I deal with on train done educated people like so... 


I reread a lot of this and it's garbage. If somebody wants to edit it go for it but don't blame me. Blame Samsung' talk to text feature.  Or reach out and we can have an actual conversation that you can record. "
highschoolteachers,"Story time! 

So, I have a friend who was in a very similar position to you. She was a very talented musician, but also excelled in math and sciences in school. Her family was really encouraging her to go into engineering, and she almost did, but at the last minute she switched to music.

She's now a very successful conductor, composer, and soloist. And she's really happy that she didn't do engineering.

___
Now for a personal story. I am pretty sure that I want to be a teacher. I have known that since I was in high school. But I let my family (and my own high school teachers) convince me to try engineering, so now I'm a computer engineer. It's okay, but I'm not the happiest, and I'm planning to go back and get my teaching degree soon.

___

Basically my point is that you know yourself best- what do you think would be the best thing for *you*?

I'd recommend keeping your options open at least in your first year of college if that's possible. Computer science experience is never a bad thing, and if you enjoy it then it can be a great career. But if being a band director is your dream, then go for it! You probably won't get super rich but it's not a bad living, and money isn't really the most important thing anyway."
highschoolteachers,"My parents told me that I can major in whatever I want so they would be completely supportive of my decision. With computer science I would be happy, but I feel like with music I would be much happier. I've had a couple teachers inspire me throughout high school and it's an amazing feeling, and i want to do that to others through music."
highschoolteachers,"This sounds great! As a history teacher, I already make it a point to discuss preservation and invasive species with kids. There are lots of little points in the curriculum where it's a relevant discussion, and most students in my rural school are very interested in the subject. 

Having access to a webcomic would certainly be an interesting addition. Most high schoolers in NY need to be proficient at interpreting political cartoons in order to pass state testing, so I can see this being an extension of that. As long as the cartoons are interactive in some form (requiring some sort of analysis, answering questions, asking students to fill in blank dialogue bubbles, etc), I could see myself trying them out. "
highschoolteachers,"I had a student draw me a picture when I was teaching high school.  Had it up on my wall with others.  Sadly, he passed away during the school year and that drawing is now, and will probably always be, the most special thing given to me by a student."
highschoolteachers,"This is one of the reasons I'm glad to be teaching kindergarten. My teacher friends who teach middle and high school are worried about things like you mention, though. What seems to work for them is mutual respect between teachers and students, and having firm school policies about student electronics in class."
highschoolteachers,"When I graduated high school I went into engineering because my family expected me to and I knew it would be good money. I spent nearly four years dreading the day I'd graduate and do something I wasn't completely passionate about. I eventually switched to science education and will be doing my student teaching in just over a year. I'll graduate over ten years after finishing high school, but the time I've spent volunteering and observing in classrooms has been priceless and a confirmation that in the end I made the right choice. That said, if you want my advice, spend your first year at college (assuming you're in the US or a country with a similar university system) taking generals and classes from majors you're interested in, including some education pre-reqs. Talk to your university's academic counseling center, chat with professors in fields you are interested in, and don't make a decision right away.

Edit: fixed auto corrects from typing on my phone."
highschoolteachers,"I would wholeheartedly agree with the person who mentioned not to treat them like they are too young; students want respect. I would prioritize having a procedure for every movement those kids make: Classroom Management by Wong is incredible for high schoolers. 

Make sure you know what you will teach as soon as you can because if they split you between depts (ELA and SS) you will have to become a master of both curriculums of content/disciplines. 

For exposure: I'd watch Teaching Channel videos  for High School. The woman with the curly blonde hair is good.

Use the summer to tackle weeks one through three of routines, procedures, and the decoration of your physical space so that you may command and impress your students in August. Content comes much smoother if you have an airtight plan of how things run in your high school classroom. Congrats!

"
highschoolteachers,"I'm still young and ignorant, but I subbed for a special-ed job last year that blew my mind. 

It was a job ""teaching"" (babysitting) extreme behavioral issues high school students who can't function in the typical classroom due to both grades and violent tendencies. Most all of them had some sort of social worker that visited every month or so. The thing that blew my mind was how ridiculous the system was set up. The kids were in a separate building away from their peers, and they were to spend their entire 6-7 hr day in the same room (only leaving for lunch). Each kid had their own individual state mandated test book to work on that would get them their missing credit from the classes they had previously failed. It was an actual book, so it was supposed to take the entire year to complete. I was  basically expected to teach 6 different subjects to 10 students at the same time.

It felt like prison. I covered it for several days and could slowly feel myself going insane just from the time consuming monotony. I couldn't imagine how the kids felt having to sit there each day. The job didn't even require teaching; it wasn't like I was standing up there leading them through a lesson. It was literally just ""make sure the kids are working on their book"". 

I guess my question would be ""Are you seriously just keeping this program on its bare bones just so you can increase attendance numbers?"". Or ""Can we not afford to get these kids some more aides to work with them? There's no feasible way to take care of those kids single-handedly."""
highschoolteachers,"I'm a female high school teacher, so different situation, but I just call everyone ""sweetie"" - boys, girls, other teachers, desks I bump into... "
highschoolteachers,"I have taught high school science and chemistry. I call them young scientists or chemists and it seems to work. 

Any variety is nice. Hearing the same thing said over and over again can get annoying, for you and for students."
highschoolteachers,"None of that read like good advice for teachers; to me it read more like something for laypeople to read and agree with.

Here's my #1: Treat them like people no different than any other people.

Source: I teach in a high school with a 2/3 Native American population. "
highschoolteachers,"Why does the superintendent's son get his own special education teacher while this other boy who is obviously struggling and suffering not even get an aide? 

Also, I totally agree with your credit recovery statements. I think credit recovery should be reserved for second semester of a student's senior year. At that point, they won't have enough time to do all of their high school education. They will actually have to learn something while in their real classes. "
highschoolteachers,"I worked at a preschool the summer before teaching high school the first time, and we did this too. 

Cut to the day I did this in front of a class to a student with a serious attitude problem who said with all the snark a high school girl can muster, ""I am *not* your friend."" 

You're right. You're a bitch. That's what I thought. Not what I said.

Moral of this story: be careful whom you use that pet name on!! My experience did get better but that was a real low point"
highschoolteachers,"I am so tired of whiners.  

Not the kids.  They're teenagers and it's apart of their nature.  I'm talking about the adults that graduated high school and college (sometimes twice), accepted a position at a school and knowing what they are getting into, and STILL bitching and whining about being asked to do the job that they were hired to do.

Sorry, you can't do whatever you want to do in your classroom.  

Sorry, working in a public school comes with a large measure of public trust, and with that comes public oversight.

Sorry, you're not an expert on educational psychology when you walk through the door.  Hopefully it will come with time.

Sorry, giving lectures is not effective teaching.  If you expect the kids to adapt to your only method then you are being an unprofessional educator.

Sorry, NOTHING WORKS PERFECTLY THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY IT. That doesn't mean you don't try it again.  

Sorry, your big, bad boss criticized you.  That's what they are there for.  Take it, make an effort, and get over it.

Sorry, the kids have always been rude and difficult to manage for every generation of teachers (including for John Adams).  You have my sympathy but you're going to have to suck it up and adapt."
highschoolteachers,"I call everyone ""kiddo"".  And I only do that because I forget names.  I wouldn't go with pet names in middle/high school.  I teach preschool and can get away with 'sweetie'.  "
highschoolteachers,Do NOT treat them like your elementary school students.  If there's one sure way to completely lose a class it's to talk to them the way you talk to 3rd graders.  I had a teacher in high school who did exactly that (she'd taught elementary for something like 20 years before moving to high school) and it was a terrible year for both her and her students.  Talk to them like the adults they very much feel that they are.
highschoolteachers,"&gt; If you have books that you absolutely have to teach, I would explore pairing whole class texts with student book clubs.

This is a great idea. I went to high school in BC and my ELA AP 12 teacher ran a book club along with the regular books. We could get extra credit for participating in the book club which depended on how much you participated (points for reading the book, points for attending a meeting, points for a book report). It was great because we were able to read books we wouldn't normally have and that interested us. You didn't have to do book club for every book if you didn't want to. "
highschoolteachers,"The AP US History test was yesterday morning.  It is set by the College Board and individual schools don't get to change it.  Again, information missing here - but unless your daughter's school has a crazy schedule where 6th period is in the morning, she should have been able to go and get help.  

It is tough as a parent to balance the fact that your child is almost an adult, with the fact that she's not an adult yet and still needs mom and dad.  I think that your next step might be deciding whether this is an area you want her to try out her ""adult wings"", and take care of business for herself, or where you need to step in as a parent and help guide her.  If you choose option 2, then I would call the pre-Calc teacher and set up a meeting between yourself, your daughter, and the Pre-Calc and AP Stats teachers.  The purpose of this meeting would be to find out exactly what the situation is:  Why is she starting an AP Stats class at the end of the year?  Was this optional?  Who is responsible for teaching the content?  What are the expectations for your daughter?  Is she taking advantage of all opportunities to learn?  How exactly will the grades work?  That kind of thing.  You are on the same team, the goal is your daughter's success.

As a high school teacher, I want to see my students be successful.  I love that they are involved in many activities, and I do my best to support them in that.  However, I have students who have to miss class a LOT due to these activities.  I make myself available to them before school, after school, homeroom (when they aren't gone for those activities anyway), during my planning period, etc and very few of them take me up on it.  They do not enjoy that they have to take tests/quizzes like everyone else, and think that it's not fair because they were gone.  (I'm reasonable with this - I don't make them take it at the same time if they've missed the past 3 days of school and didn't have the opportunity to learn everything).  I can't help that they were gone.  I can't give them an A simply because they are good kids.  I make sure they have opportunities to come in and learn before they take the test.  Our choices have consequences, and we have to live with them.  If it is important to me to have an A, I will get up and get myself to school early to get help, stay after school, or find some other way to get what I need in order to be successful.

If your daughter is taking advantage of every opportunity and still struggling, then it might be time to look at whether the school is handling this situation appropriately or not."
highschoolteachers,"What I am most nervous about is exactly that. I was looking up the curriculum and it tells you exactly what texts you have to teach, and for the most part I haven't read them (yet). I feel it makes more sense to give teachers more freedom so they can be passionate about the texts they are teaching. I went to a private high school and the year I fell in love with reading was when I took electives that my teacher designed and they were was amazing. 

As of yet I have no idea how closely the school follows the book. "
highschoolteachers,"I use ""friend"" interchangeably. I teach high school, and the kids think it's funny (probably because I usually use it when calling them out for something stupid or something they're not supposed to be doing: ""What are you doing, friend?""). "
highschoolteachers,"One of my high school teachers did basically a breakfast pot luck the day of the AP test. We all loved it, it was relatively relaxing, nice and calm, and it meant we were all fed! "
highschoolteachers,"Ok, you should definitely apply. But sometimes that path is best left behind. I applied for a position in my old high school, bent the ear of an old teacher/mentor about it, then applied. I interviewed with a group that included an former teacher of mine, did a model lesson in their brand new building, and was eventually offered the job.

What I left out was that their hiring process was exceptionally long (for a supposedly immediate opening) and left me feeling pretty disrespected. The day they called to offer me the position was the day I was going to call and let them know I was taking a position in the district in which I was already working. I had gone out of my way to let each district know a job in the other existed and that I had made myself a candidate for each. Their response was less than stellar.

I filled the aforementioned former teacher in about all of this and his response was surprising in its lack of surprise. Apparently this was the district's MO and he had personally seen them lose best candidates before, as they lost me, by taking too long to make a decision and leaving the candidate feeling disrespected. Not something I would ever have realized as a student there. 

YMMV but don't get too gumdrops and rainbows because it's your old stomping ground either."
highschoolteachers,"I am in my second year in NC. Starting pay is $35000. Masters degrees do not increase your pay. I teach math in a rural high school. Pretty good kids. 
I was born in WV so I am a Yankee. I was shocked to see the rebel flag so often. I am accused of racism sometimes, which is common. Parents will want to believe their child is not misbehaving and I am just against them. 
Schools vary widely in teaching conditions. I enjoy it. "
highschoolteachers,"I don't know about that, but Virginia releases 'practice tests' for high school math every year. I think there are years of giant old geometry packets.

http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/released_tests/archive.shtml - archive of old test items.

highschoolteachers,"At my school, if the sub doesn't leave a list of absences the teacher has to get the full absence report from the office, which lists every kid absent that day in our middle school or high school--much easier to just know that Mark, Clark, and Bark were absent first period than to go through the entire list, figure out which kids in your classes were absent, etc. That full report also doesn't account for kids who showed up late or had early release or who were there that day, but missed a particular class for some reason.  "
highschoolteachers,"I worked in an office for a nonprofit for three years. My local college has a program for people with a previous degree in a content area to get a master's in education. I love it, but like others have said, it's an investment, and I didn't get into a classroom until the semester before student teaching, so I wasn't sure if I'd like it until I was already $10k and a year into it.

I reached out to local high school teachers to let me observe their classes so that I could make a better decision, but I was still uncertain until I got into the classroom. But hey, if it fails, there's always more offices to work in."
highschoolteachers,"I am in a similar situation to you: I got my undergrad degree in English, am 3 years out of school and have been subbing for past year and a half. I'm starting a teacher certification program for 7-12 English in the fall.

I've been subbing at all grade levels from K-12. When I was initially interested in teaching, I was exclusively interested in high school because middle school seemed SO awful. I remembered my middle school experience as the shittiest time for basically everyone. 

Now it's my absolute favorite grade level to sub at. To me middle school is a great mix between the better parts of elementary (the kids are excited to do things, want to play games and do fun activities, and still act like goofy little kids sometimes) and the better parts of high school (more maturity, being able to handle more responsible and take things more seriously, you can talk to them more like adults, they're developing their own passions and opinions), without some of the worst parts of those (elementary: being too wild and crazy/exhausting to deal with; high school: being more apathetic, ""we're never gonna use this why do we have to learn it"", ""i'm 18 years old why do i have to listen to teachers"", just wanting to sit and stare at their phones all day/talk about how fucked up they got over the weekend and who is banging who). The best relationships I've built  as a sub have been with with kids in the 6th-9th grade range.

tl;dr: I was afraid middle schoolers would be the WORST, but after working with them for a 1+ year it's the grade level I am most interested in teaching. "
highschoolteachers,"Jordan School District in Utah. Chemistry/biology at a High School. I haven't seen many high school science listings, so I applied for basically anything. There is a $2000 bonus for people licensed in Chemistry. New teachers get $1000 to setup their class."
highschoolteachers,"I have used board games and video games with success in high school math classes. There are games like zombie dice and roll for it what lend themselves very well to statistics and probability, and I've used mariokart to talk about conditional probability. 

That said, I don't really use any education specific stuff in class, no. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm not going to pussy foot around this shit. I'm not going to try to make you feel bad. Do you want to know why? This shit has happened to me, too.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that everything you said and did is absolutely true. You talked to high school kids about going to a concert and you showed another group how to do a push-up. You didn't do a single thing wrong. 

What you have here is a situation where the administration is a bunch of overly conservative prudish assholes. 

Oh, and even if you are a drunken stripper, as long as you're not breaking any laws, there's not a damn thing they should be able to do. I understand that they absolutely can choose to not hire you or choose to not have you sub in the school. But, do not start believing you deserve to feel bad about being human.

Now, if this is really bothering you, you should go talk to the AP. Tell them that you're upset that these allegations were made against you. And, you find the whole stripper comment to be borderline sexual harassment. Then, drop that fucking mic and walk out of there.

TL;DR-Downvote away. I'm obviously very angry today. I'm over it."
highschoolteachers,"I student taught first grade summer school. As a fourth year high school teacher, the parallels are astounding. "
highschoolteachers,"Sounds suspiciously like some high school students I taught...

(Currently a substitute)"
highschoolteachers,"Sounds like you're in a non-NGSS state and one with a three year high school science requirement. Does this mean your students will be able to graduate with Earth, bio and physics or are they still going to need chem? You said they must pass chem in your district but is that just because they don't have another option? Graduation is important. Hopefully the changes you make will help the students. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm down at the middle school level, so the conversation is a bit less serious that at high school. However, I agree with your general statements.

Follow the IEP, make accommodations and modifications. However, with these accommodations and modifications, the student can be assessed normally (unless it says otherwise in the IEP, they have modified grades for EL reasons, etc). If the student still fails, even with the support, then it is my belief the student should fail the class.

I think it's important to remember that our goal is to do what is best for the child here. If the IEP, accommodations and modifications are not working, then that needs to be known. The only way to bring that to light, is to provide data that they are not working (such as a student failing a class). 

Just make sure you document everything, and possibly make copies of student work as well. This will help you make your case, and also help identify what other support the student may need. "
highschoolteachers,"I am still developing a great deal of my teaching style but since no one has answered I'll throw in my aphorism: I don't make exceptions, I make accommodations and suggestions. 

If you have followed the IEP with ABSOLUTE FIDELITY and the student still fails, it is time to bring in a counselor/aide. Let the aide do what they will. If, even with THESE accommodation, the student STILL fails? Meet with a counselor and the AP and have a suggestion ready to make about the student's future.

Had a student last fall. He was a senior, failed ALL high school courses but still ended up in my senior English. Fuck that. The counselor made helpful suggestions about several alternative schools and programs in the area that would better meet his needs and learning style and for some kids that is what you need to do. Do NOT pass students who are not able to meet the minimum requirements of passing on (with reasonable accommodation). DO work with aides/counselors to make all possible accommodations before making alternative suggestions.

I have a big problem with letting kids get their diploma without earning it. That said, try working with his aide as much as you can before the end of the grading period.

I dunno, I hope this helps? Or at least makes you feel less bad since I'm a little ruthless lol"
highschoolteachers,"Give them the grades they earn. I teach science, so my grading isn't as subjective as an English essay. But, if you use a rubric to grade your students, you can show that they have only earned a certain number of points. Encourage the student who is improving. Let him/her know that that you are proud. Offer to work with them. As for the ""respectful/seemingly hard working kids"", they know exactly what they're doing. I'm assuming you're at the high school level. At this point, they are old enough to know how to handle their business. And, if they don't know how to handle their business, they need help figuring it out. I tell my students that I don't *give* grades; they *earn* grades. "
highschoolteachers,"First time posting here and I've been wanting to say everything about my experience as a sub teacher for over a year so far:

-In my first year of sub teaching, I thought I was gonna like high school and wanted to become an art teacher, but I realized that I enjoyed elementary, realizing that teaching more than one subject to little people and varying degrees of kids (K-2 and SPED) is more refreshing and exciting.

-The last straw for me subbing at a high school was a HS Resource class that had some of the most obnoxious and rude students (with exception to this inspiring artist who showed me his cool drawings), I cancelled my week-long HS assignment and went into a 4th grade class that had subs for weeks with no explanation on why the current teacher was present. Although challenging, it was a fresh take on teaching (for me).

-There's this principal that's apparently herald as a caring, going-over-her way type. She wasn't like that to me not one bit. Even telling her that I was just a first-year sub and for me to stop the math lesson because it was too complicated to understand or teach (Engage N.Y., don't like it), she ended up ragging on me and just saw me with in a negative light rather than being supportive and critical at what ""I could have done"" professionally. I told her that I was interested in SPED, but insisted that I wanted to do it because it was easy to get a job, seeing I wanted to do it for the money.

She had an assembly with the 5th graders basically bitching about their behavior and stuff like graffiti in the bathroom, but here's the kicker: she offered students to come up and dig up some names so they can take them out to a well-known local burger joint (I'm not sure if that's appropriate, or professional). She also chewed me out on whether I can do a good job or teach at all, according to a student who overheard a conversation from her and another teacher while we passed her in the hallway, walking back to class. I never went back to that school.

-My next year consisted of 2 long term assignments with some of the most supportive classes/people I've ever felt in the room. Although I was the sub teacher and with a 1:1 ratio of student:para, it felt positive and exciting to be in those classes. It gave a positive outlook in becoming a SPED teacher and the inner workings of it.

-Roving sub positions vary from being easygoing and having lots of breaks to horribly rough.

-Will not/almost never sub at a middle school. Heard enough bad experiences from other subs and just my bad experience as a student.

-If you write lesson plans for a sub for your K class, don't write 2 paragraphs about a math lesson. Just tell me simple things and I will execute them the best I can. In general, unless it's about behavior, 7 pages of sub plans may be a bit too much in 12-point font."
highschoolteachers,"TBH looks don't matter as much as you might think.  You'll be powerful.  That's very attractive.

Source: I was a high school girl who crushed on some ugly teachers."
highschoolteachers,Same. Turn the conversation to something boring and non-teen. They walk away. I had experience with this while in high school. Was not too good at social life.
highschoolteachers,"I work in elementary so my experience might be different than a middle/high school teacher.

My kids have been so sweet all week. I got an envelope of candy addressed to ""the best teecher ever"" and a new pencil sharpener (actually it's great, mine broke weeks ago). I also got a little baggie and one of those ""a lifesaver for when you..."" notes from my quietest kiddo. Also, a ton of hugs. Sooooo many hugs. 

The PTA is buying us lunch tomorrow from Moe's and Friday is a half day, comped from parent teacher conferences this week after school. 

It's been pretty great, honestly. 

It helps that our principal is a genuinely sweet and helpful lady (actually retired, and is covering for our regular principal who had to get surgery) and she's been making announcements in the morning about it being teacher appreciation week. I bet it's half a real thank you and half a reminder to the kids. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes, but not because of me. His dad wanted him to play baseball, and made him sign up. He didn't want to play baseball. He knew three weeks of having an F in a class would get him kicked off the team. He chose my class, unfortunately, got his Fs, and as soon as he was off the team, raised his grade back up.

What's funny is that once he got to high school he decided he liked baseball, made the team, and was a very good player."
highschoolteachers,"Oh, I grew up with it. We've had more than 100 days in a row over 100. In high school marching band my shoes melted to the blacktop. Such is life."
highschoolteachers,This worked really well for a friend of mine during his student teaching high school placement. Use the wrong name a few times and the girl quickly lost interest.
highschoolteachers,"You'd be surprised at our STEM school...yes, we offer calculus, but we also have teachers that teach differential equations, linear algebra, number theory, etc.  If you're able to pitch and teach a math/programming course, even more valuable.  Look into STEM magnets and charters...there's a LOT of different opportunities.  A lot of us here are teaching college curriculum...but we teach here b/c we love working with high school students every day..."
highschoolteachers,"In my first year as a middle school teacher, I had problems with high school girls hitting on me, not even my own students. I grew a three inch beard and it pretty much solved the problem. 

I will second the need to have a conversation about boundaries. I don't think telling them how it makes you feel is ""blood in the water"" or showing weakness. I think students should realize that teachers have feelings, and that they should be considerate to us.

Ignoring inappropriate behavior definitely doesn't work if it's gotten to this point. 

I'm guessing you're still new too. Once you've been around for a while, it will be less exciting for them.  "
highschoolteachers,"I won't have a job to move there with, nor a degree so my options are limited. That being said, we will have about $100k in cash to purchase a piece of land around $30k-40k, and build a tiny house with rain catchment and solar at around $40k. That would still leave us with about $20k-$25k as an emergency fund. We lived on Oahu for two years after high school, so I'm well aware of the cost of living in Hawaii. Living on the big island can be done very cheaply if you think outside the box and live modestly. 

If you look at the pay scale steps, as a 3rd year teacher my wife would be earning about $43k-$45k a year, I believe. If you have no mortgage or car payment, that is plenty of money to live more than comfortably. After taxes and insurance, take home would be about $3k a month. Car insurance, gas, food, student loans and other necessary expenses won't be even close to $3k. We are trying to figure out how to pay off the student loans before moving too, and if that works out, we'll be more than fine.

With all due respect, many people who move to Hawaii from the mainland want to keep up with the Jones's, and want a regular house, a nice car etc. They think they deserve it. They also usually have crippling student loan debt, which we do not. If you think you're going to buy a $500k house, have two $40k cars and spend money on nonsense like a lot of mainlanders do, then ya, you're absolutely correct. That's not us though. "
highschoolteachers,"My recommendation there: Khan Academy! I'm using their Intro to JavaScript curriculum right now to teach a high school class, but I think it would be accessible to younger kids as well. It's all browser-based so would be perfect for chromebooks. Agreed that there are sooooo many ways to volunteer: Girls Who Code, TEALS, Citizen Schools just to name a few."
highschoolteachers,"I deal with it too. Worse because it's high school. Everyone assumes you're a pedophile already.
Ugly yourself up. I stopped shaving. Little kids hate beards. And I grew a beer gut. That's mostly for me. 
Try picking up smoking, the smell will repulse them. Try a pipe or cigars so you remind them of grandpa.

Stop brushing your teeth,too.

(Teaching satire right now, apologies.)"
highschoolteachers,"I was firmly against extrinsic incentives, but a friend talked me into trying tickets (she teachers high school). It is insane, if you offer a kid a ticket for attempting to answer a question, after a few weeks all hands are up-- and often you don't even need to give tickets at that point. It conditions them that they should all be trying to think about the answer. That was 6th grade. Maybe try it. Maybe not. I hated the idea, now I will use it next year. "
highschoolteachers,I teach high school and I have the same problem. I just treat it as like I'm totally oblivious to any sort of romantic engagement. So when the girls would try to flirt with me I would respond like they were having a totally professional conversation. They got bored pretty fast after that. 
highschoolteachers,My last class period my principal delivers a new Polo shirt with our school logo on it pretty decent. Problem was all my kids were out of the class on a photo scavenger hunt (high school journalism) and I was playing super smash bros....awkwaaaard. thanks for all you do...which apprlarently is wrecking DK with Kirby repeatedly.
highschoolteachers,"Im a high school senior, and at the very least, chrome books evoke a sense of professionalism more than an iPad does, as a laptop is what is used in the everyday world. Students in my district are given iPads not chrome books, and it was bad for me up through sophomore year, and its bad for the other freshman and sophomores that I'm seeing. iPads have the ability to do handwriting for math, which is nice, but they are also attached to an app store chalk full of things more fun than classwork, and the internet, which are inhibitors to education. At least with the chrome books, they aren't designed to be compatible with games and stuff. The google drive system is extremely  lacking beyond the basics of word processing and slideshows, but it does the job I feel for most people. SO, although chrome books are pretty pathetic laptops, they are better than some alternatives."
highschoolteachers,"Wow thanks, that is really helpful! To be honest, I'm not super keen on teaching high school level math classes. The entire reason I want to leave my profession is to make computer science more accessible to the next generation. But maybe I could get lucky and find a school that is hiring and already has a CS department (or is willing to create one)? =/"
highschoolteachers,"Alright. So if I got my BA in History, would that be enough to teach high school, or do I need some sort of secondary schooling certificate?"
highschoolteachers,"In our district, a teacher is a teacher. If they're on the same step with the same level of education, a kindergarten teacher makes the same as a high school physics teacher who makes the same as a middle school PE teacher. In my district, they also load the PE teacher with much larger classes.

I may have my ideas about who is worth more, but I can't imagine telling the HS French teacher that a math teacher is worth more, and so will get more, or a second grade teacher that a sixth grade teacher works harder so the sixth grade teacher will get more. Those are not my ideas about who I think is worth more, though! Those are just examples! And until I have taught every subject in every grade level, I can't speak with any real knowledge at all."
highschoolteachers,I have a BS in chemistry and secondary endorsement. As a high school science teacher it is a little different than in other areas.
highschoolteachers,"This is one of those topics I tend to rant about with my friends.  I graduated in December after doing my student teaching during the fall semester.  One of the required classes at my university was ""Education Technology"" and was taught by a ~50 year old woman (this is relevant, I promise).  In her mind, and in the mind of the many guest speakers, anyone under the age of ~30 was ""tech native"" having grown up with something with a microchip in it.  The entire class, unfortunately, was basically playing with iPad apps.  Pretty much every single one of my classmates agrees that it was, by a wide margin, the worst class we took in our education program.  It might have been relevant for teachers like my mother, who retired about 4 years ago after 30 years in, primarily, a 5th grade classroom and who has a decent working understanding of a pc but little more.

The thing is, compared to these teachers, my professor and my mother, the high school freshmen I taught during my student teaching **were** ""tech native"".  But compared to myself and my student teaching peers, they were just absolutely terrible on computers.  They knew mobile tech like their cell phones and tablets as well as anyone, but they didn't know simple non-mobile tech things like, as /u/eman14 said, how to operate windows, manage files, work Microsoft office, or even how to type.  My students were so far from being ""tech native"" as to be hilarious.  They were mobile-tech native at best.

Just as a point of comparison, I can remember taking very basic typing classes starting in about 3rd grade.  My elementary school had a library computer lab that had about 25 or 30 first generation iMacs in it that we'd go to every couple of weeks to do basic typing exercises and play typing games.  By junior high, we were taking dedicated computer classes that included being able to type at least 60 wpm with a plastic thing blocking our view of the keyboard.  One of my fellow student teachers last fall taught a couple sections of computer apps 1, which focused on the Microsoft Office suite of programs.  However, they usually had to wait at least a month into the semester to even start on Word because they had to teach the students how to type because almost none of them had had a class that covered that skill prior to reaching high school.  The district I was in wasn't rich but it wasn't poor either.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I personally think the single biggest issue with technology in the classroom right now is that to those in the halls of power (administration, school boards, state education committees), technology is technology.  They do not, perhaps even cannot, distinguish between technology that is primarily about entertainment (iPads, cell phone apps) and technology that is about something more ""productive"" like PCs.  To them, the student who grew up having their own cell phone since they were 10 is the same as the, now, young teacher who grew up communicating with friends over instant messenger programs.  And we seem to have left a generation behind as a result."
highschoolteachers,"Please know that there may be nothing wrong with you. Sometimes there is just someone who fits their needs more.

I interviewed for the district I student taught at. I kicked ass while I was there at the middle school. Every student, teacher, parent, administrator loved me. I volunteered for every activity and attended many after-school programs. I was a superstar at that school. I would love to go back.

I interviewed for an open high school math position in the same district. Please know that my content knowledge is absolutely AP ready, so its not like I'd be teaching something I don't understand. I killed it at every interview and was ready to sign the contract and begin working. I received an email a few days later saying they chose someone else.

Obviously, I was very confused and torn-up about it. I had applied everywhere, I thought, and had done so many interviews. I literally did everything right, and I didn't get the job. No indication as to why or anything. Three years later, my current district hired a data coordinator who had worked at the school I student taught at. She said she remembered that I interviewed and so I asked her if she knew, just out of curiosity. She told me they posted ""Math"", but really looking for someone to take up the Engineering program.

I am in no way qualified to teach Engineering. It would have been a mistake to hire me for that, and I'm glad I landed where I did.

Please remember, you really don't know what job you are interviewing for. They may have a specific plan for the position, and if they see that someone else fits that plan better, they'll choose them. It's not always that you did something wrong or that you aren't good enough. Sometimes it's just about fit."
highschoolteachers,"Every day I fight with my high school seniors. Please stop talking to your friends, please look up here, please get up out of your chair so you can see this demo, please listen and contribute to this discussion.

Then after they blow the test I hear, ""When did you teach us this? I've never seen this before! This isn't fair!""

So what am I doing wrong? Maybe I should be a better *entertainer* so I can compete with their friends, their laptops and their phones?"
highschoolteachers,"I am a tech instructor in high school and a former developer of embedded computers and software. I know and love technology. I am a HUGE fan of Chromebooks. 

Chromebooks are not useful for learning Microsoft Office applications or Apple's productivity applications. If you think that's what computer literacy should be, then I strongly disagree."
highschoolteachers,It takes a different type of person to teach at each different level...doesn't make you crazy.  I teach high school and love it...I don't have the patience for elementary school.  It just takes a different person and personality for each different school!  We need great middle school teachers!
highschoolteachers,"I whole heatedly agree with the above post.  Keep documentation of your efforts.  Keep pressing the issue.  Explore other avenues for compelling those who should and must act to do so.  I have so much more to say, as I myself have dealt with two suicidal students (one a former student who came to me before school mid-year in a desperate plea for someone to help, as she wasn't finding support at the high school she currently attends) just this year.  It may come to nothing, but I would rather embarrass myself and alienate colleagues before I will sit by and allow a student in that situation to go unaided.  "
highschoolteachers,I'm not sure because we took two my senior year and the guy the year before me took three. I'm teaching at my old high school and prom's this weekend.
highschoolteachers,"I know the feeling. Seriously. I graduated from this district where they love to hire their own alumni. I worked last year as a permanent sub for the high school. I interviewed for (and received) a spot in the district's pet project this year. All this with them knowing that I was working toward my teaching credential. The administrators always helped me along, answered questions, encouraged me. I was given the impression that I'd be walking into a contract at the end of this year (it was literally said ""let me know when you're done so we can get you a contract""). Now it's the end of the year, there are a ton of SPED positions open in my district, 3-4 open in the high school I've been working for... and not even an interview. I'm getting calls from other districts at least weekly. But nope, not even an interview from the district that I've busted ass for (while making horrifyingly little and being on Food Stamps and Medicaid because their pay sucks that bad)."
highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school half the senior class (about 500 kids) went to DC for a long weekend, including a school day.  The other 500 kids who didn't go on the trip didn't go to school.  That was senior skip day."
highschoolteachers,"I mean I'm sure you could look it all up or something but I see it as elementary school teaches you how to learn, and then you start showing how you learn.  Your ability level there places you in middle school.  How you do in middle school places you in high school.  How you do in high school gets you into college... but if you never learn how to learn in elementary school it's going to set you back."
highschoolteachers,"For you (and other HS users!), www.rezzly.com is a great resource.  There you create assignments as ""quests"" and assign experiences points to each.  There can be pre-reqs for having a certain quest become available to a student, and you can make each submitted request a review that you need to approve before granting XP. This is a fabulous way (I hypothesize) or working in some individualized learning. Badges and achievements are included. 

I am also going to teach in a low SES high school, and I've been developing an Alternate Reality Game to run in the classroom. Message me if you'd like info on that and elements I'm incorporating. "
highschoolteachers,"I recall my senior ditch day.

Was literally one of three students to walk into my English class (first period, no less). Teacher showed up with only 10 minutes left to class, baffled, to see the three of us sitting outside the door to the classroom doing homework for other classes. The look on her face and how hard she started laughing has been one of my favorite high school memories since. :)

Unfortunately for me, I teach freshmen. Only time a decent number of them are gone is when it rains in the mornings... Right now, I really miss the rain..."
highschoolteachers,"I love teaching middle school. I taught high school initially and didn't care for it. Think of it this way, middle school students (grades 6-8) are old enough to take care of themselves but young enough to still need and want guidance. They're a perfect middle ground, in my opinion. I've been teaching middle school for seven years, and there's never a dull moment. 

This is a great time to get into the teaching profession in certain states. For example I am teaching in Southern California and there's such a shortage of teachers that we're recruiting from the east coast. Meaning that many districts are hiring teacher candidates who are still in their teaching credential programs, as intern teachers. Many districts in my area have began to pay more and offer tenure after fewer years. "
highschoolteachers,"Not really any consequences no.

The only thing I can think is when you get to 9th grade and want to take higher level classes. The teacher will look at 8th grade scores and say ""Nuh-uh"" and you'll have to be waived into the class (if its an advanced course).

It really is only 9-12 that matters for college. K-8 was just building your knowledge bank, your social skills and your logic/reasoning skills. Not to mention reading and writing, but I digress.

9th grade is to make most of that tumble like a tent in a tornado. 10th grade is the rebound. 11th grade is when you start realizing your grades aren't good enough for Harvard. 12th grade is when you realize the true meaning of the word ""anxiety"".

Edit: I should say that most high school teachers think middle school grades are a joke. I'm inclined to believe them after a couple of years of students. I get students in my class that had straight A's in math, but suddenly they can't rearrange D=m/V to solve for m. And when I do it on the board they want me to show them how I did it 5 different ways. Like...wtf guys? Have you never solved for ""x"" in a problem?"
highschoolteachers,"A student's grades are a public record and can be accessed by any adult who has dealings with the student.  Therefore, while a student is still active in the school system, all of those records would still bet there.

I don't think there are consequences for doing poorly in the lower grades. We all hope for students to improve, whether it is their academics, or simply their attitude. Punishing a student who is doing well in high school for not doing well or not trying their best in elementary school seems counterintuitive."
highschoolteachers,"This. 1 thousand times this.

Don't be anything but frank with your responses to personal questions. Most honestly **do not** care. They want to disrupt the class for a few minutes and the little bit you give them each day adds up to *a lot* of disruption.

Not to mention the other students notice and want to chip in as well. Shut it down.

Some teachers deal with this by prescribing a certain time to talk about these things...if the students really care. Usually the first 5-10 minutes on a Friday or Monday. Take your pick. I usually like to waste a little time on a Monday because...well...let's face it--it's Monday. Not EVERY Monday, but quite often they'll have silly questions they want to ask.

Figure out where your line is and don't cross it. Some teachers like to share everything. Others like to share nothing. I'm in between. I will share my experiences (like what I did for a break or a long weekend as long as it's appropriate), but I do not like to talk about dating, college life, etc. If admin. walks through and they hear a kid remark about ""Mr. so and so knows how to play beer pong"" it sounds fishy.

Now I will say that *drinking* isn't necessarily bad to talk about. I do talk about it, but it's always in a social atmosphere. ""I went drinking with a couple friends."" The first time a student makes a remark about it I say something along the lines of ""I'm older than 21 and I always do so responsibly. I hope you don't have to learn the hard way to do the same when you get to that age.""

Then again I would not make any remarks to certain levels of students. This is high school. 10th, 11th and 12th graders. Never cross this line with 9th graders. Ever. Just never ever.

I have yet to get an email or a complaint about this by the way."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, and while I prefer a room that is not visually cluttered with tons of posters, charts, etc., the decorative focal point of the room is a large bulletin board with student work/essays. I do also have a few charts and signs, but I think wall-to-wall coverage is a little distracting. "
highschoolteachers,"Well, awkwardly enough, I took a job at the high school in the same district, teaching a different subject. And no, the Jr. High and High School principals don't get along well (small town district). Anyways, I'm super happy now. "
highschoolteachers,"I can see that. I don't remember learning anything ecology related, but I clearly remember all the chemistry applications (to this day I always stay away from chemistry if I can).

I would likely be teaching anatomy or biology at the high school level and then go back for my masters to teach at the college level. Do you know how much of a need there is for anatomy instructors?"
highschoolteachers,Hell no. I moved to that area because my friends were stationed at the near by Air Force base. I got suckered into that school. I am currently at one of the top high schools in the area. I had great observations and reviews this year.
highschoolteachers,I teach high school English 1 and I would love to do this as well. I'm down for anything to keep kids motivated. I teach in a very low socioeconomic school district so it would be amazing to get these kids excited about education. 
highschoolteachers,"I teach juniors and seniors (grade 11 and 12, ages 15-19) and I still put up posters and creative projects.

Edit: I'd like to add, high school seniors are still crazy about *stickers*."
highschoolteachers,Never. I teach high school science and I still put up student work. 
highschoolteachers,"Not really. Have you taken the CSETs for science? Because they're easy. I majored in EE, as in no biology or geoscience in college and was able to pass both those tests with only a couple hours of studying. Assuming the OP took science in high school they have some background in it. Or maybe I am secretly a science genius, news to me I guess.

Also, you don't need to take the calc part of the math test to teach in middle school. You can get a foundational math credential without that and can teach through geometry."
highschoolteachers,"I just spent all year preparing my kids for a state exam, and today the school put me and a group of kids into a classroom for testing that had no A/C. They've known for two weeks that the A/C doesn't work in that room and they still asked 25 kids to do their best on a test they have to pass in order to graduate high school while sweating and fanning themselves and stripping off what clothes they could. All of the answer sheets came back wrinkled with moisture from the sweat on their arms.

I teach for the kids, but sometimes the demoralizing, senseless decisions of the higher-ups are too much to take."
highschoolteachers,"I did TFA in the Las Vegas Valley, and I'm still teaching there. (This is my third year of teaching--my first non-TFA year.)

Overwhelmingly, I dislike TFA. I found the training to be substandard and the support once the school year began to be a joke. The MTLD who was supposed to be supporting me was in my classroom maybe a total of 4 times during my first year of teaching and no more than 2 times during my second year of teaching. I had to rely on veteran teachers at my school and read a lot of stuff on the internet and ask questions of anyone I possibly could. Though TFA promised all of this support and help and guidance, I received none of it.

That being said: Like you, I majored in English, not education. I now teach high school English, and I absolutely love my job. I don't plan to leave education for a very long time. And my current career and lifestyle would not have been possible without Teach for America. Although I pretty much despise the organization, I'm still glad I did it and I'm very grateful for where it has gotten me today."
highschoolteachers,"First off...congrats!!!

Now, it would be career suicide to ask for paid prep days during the break. Swallow your pride and go in unpaid during the vacation.  There's nothing wrong with asking for access to the specific information you mentioned - mostly, student info. I make my beginning of the year seating charts based on alphabetical last name which makes it easy for me to memorize their names.

Put the onus on the students the first few days. Put together some sort of assessment that will give you an indication of their skills. I'm high school English, so I would have kids write a letter to me explaining what I need to know about them. Physics is totally out of my league but you could still do something like that.

Good luck!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school physics. 

PM me your email or contact and once I get home from travel (Sunday afternoon) I can email you lessons and such for whatever unit you think you are in. Labs, homework, etc. 

I would second the other comment here, that I wouldn't expect much in the way of ""starting late.""  Mid year replacement means they want someone in the room, right now, even if you are a little flustered and off-balance. If you want to make a good impression, you'll need to go in before school starts and do some work. It's part of the gig. But you can go in treating this as your and the students first day of school, round 2. Start with your own syllabus, expectations, etc. you don't have to go in on Monday guns blazing ready to pick up right where the other person left off with a quiz on Friday. 

Plus, don't expect anything you do for the first year to be as good as you had hoped. Teaching is its own skill, separate from how well you know content of material. It will take considerable time and effort to get where you feel comfortable. My advice: focus as much (if not more) on classroom management, expectations, and standards at first as you do actual content. (Late work, class tardy, talking in class, group work, etc.) Come May/June you'll appreciate it. "
highschoolteachers,That's how my school was for anyone planning on teaching high school. 
highschoolteachers,"Everything you are saying here touches on some of the biggest questions I find myself wondering about my career.

I can look back to high school, middle school and college and think of plenty of constructivist activities I participated in which were downright fucking useless. I can also think back to some ""lecture style"" lessons I sat through which were riveting because of both the content and the way the teacher delivered the content. Of course, I can also think of plenty of opposing scenarios. One of the hardest lessons I learned growing up is that there is a very deep satisfaction to be gained from putting mind over matter and doing my best to find something redeeming about something that is incredibly boring or difficult. 

That said, did everyone else in my classes have these same experiences? Were they bored to death while I was feeling satisfied from persevering? Is this why I became a teacher in the first place? If so, should be trying to make lessons easily accessible or should I be trying to teach the value of delayed gratification? This stuff literally keeps me up at night."
highschoolteachers,"I think it's a bit different when the teacher is 33 and the student is 22 when they meet.  When it gets weird is when the student is in high school when they meet the teacher, it's a stronger power imbalance in high school than it is when training under someone."
highschoolteachers,"The difference between professional sector unequal power relationships and teacher-student relationships is that in the professional sector, we may assume that both parties were over the age of consent when they met, while in the teacher-student scenario, the student is underage. I'm more than willing to budge on plenty of topics, particularly regarding education, however, I will never give my approval to a teacher dating an ex student. People in here have stated that they are dating a younger person that COULD have been their student. That is faulty logic. 

I am a middle school teacher and I would NEVER consider dating a former student. Even if I was a high school teacher and 21 years old, I would never even consider dating an ex student. 

Bottom line: is it illegal to date a former student? No. But why risk 4 years of school (6+ in my case) and my entire future on a fling? It would be poor judgement on my part. For me it's not even a matter of not wanting to get caught, but a moral decision that I have made. I am given an incredible amount of trust by the public and I take that responsibility very seriously. I would never jeopardize my reputation for a relationship with an ex student.  If I did, other people I work with would also begin questioning my judgement in other matters (when did the relationship start for example). You haven't seen the political side of education yet so trust me when I tell you. If there is an admin that wants you gone bad enough, they will make your life so miserable that you will resign. They do this all the time, and for things WAY less serious than dating an ex student. So my question to you is, would it EVER be worth it to risk your future for something as silly as a relationship, especially with all the single women/men out there in the world? I think you know my answer to that question already. "
highschoolteachers,"Yup.  I've known some pedo-bears who've dated high school students.  95% were fucked up situations, many ended in jail.  What kind of person finds a teenager emotionally attractive?

I do have a friend who dated someone who was a student at the rival school of where he student taught, after they had both finished. 4 year age difference.  They were from small town Midwest, and some of the locals tried to launch a criminal investigation.  The couple are happily married now.

I know several people who have had relationships across the lines in college.  All of them ended well, even if they broke up."
highschoolteachers,I am a teacher and personally I would find it odd to date a former student mostly because they are so immature. But my mom was a former student at the high school my dad taught at. He never taught her but he knew her as a student they were 5 years a part and started dating a year after she graduated. Granted this was in the 70s but they got married and had 2 kids so it depends on the situation and the people.
highschoolteachers,"Principal of one of my old schools had been a girl's coach and high school teacher. One of the players graduated, went off to college and finished, came home and then married her former coach. They've been married a very long time, couple gorgeous kids. He's a great guy. Good marriage. "
highschoolteachers,So I'm a Puritan for thinking it's inappropriate to date a former student?  Not sure if you have children but I wonder if you would have the same Laissez faire attitude if it were YOUR child that was dating their high school science teacher (even if it were 10 years after they graduated). You might begin to question whether they had those same feelings about your child during their teen years. 
highschoolteachers,"How long has it been since the student graduated? There was a former high school student of mine that went to university, got a degree in education and came back to our county to teach. We went out. Wasn't a big deal. Probably wasn't a big deal because I wasn't creeping on the girl(s) when they were in high school. "
highschoolteachers,I gotta disagree. I've got a pretty good friend and former colleague who teaches high school history. We ran in to a former student of his at a bar one night. She was 33 and an ER doc and he was 41. They traded numbers and are still together 4 years later. I definitely don't think it's a black and white issue.
highschoolteachers,"A friend of mine was a high school band director for one year. She had many male students hit on her, but one was persistent to the point that she had to tell him to hold off until he graduated (he was a senior at the time). She did not end up getting renewed the following year (not sure how related it was to their ""relationship""), he graduated, and they started dating almost immediately. He was 18, she was 25. They are still together 2.5 years later, although she is no longer in education after a very rough first year."
highschoolteachers,"From a perspective of professionalism, it is extremely unprofessional to carry on romantic relationships with current or former students. On paper, it looks bad. If documented in some kind of civil or media action, it can end your career. So it's important not to put yourself at risk professionally. It is, in most circles, unethical. 

That being said, I know a teacher who taught a student music from the time she was a high school senior, or maybe junior - I'm honestly not sure. She graduated and was then invited back to instruct a year or more later. In secret, they began a relationship. At work, they stayed professional and discreet. They married a year later. Then the cat was out of the bag, but marriage sent a message that it was a serious personal decision and not a flippant foolery of professional indiscretion. 

They have a baby now. They both work in the same school system as well. I'm fairly sure this could have gone another way had administrators wanted to fire this teacher. But the administration really supports them both and really wants to do whatever they can to keep them because the program is running so successfully with their leadership. So, there's more than just ethics involved. In this day and age, it's not just about ethics exclusively. Politics are everywhere. If you are on the chopping block already, dating a former student could definitely give a willing administrator the ammunition to go after you. So, I would advise against it. "
highschoolteachers,"The age difference isn't the odd part for me. By the time everyone is 40-ish, the differences would seem trivial. There are two issues that will make it creepy for many people:

1. The relationship will appear to have started in a situation where power was unequal, but was held off or kept secret until it was ""legal."" It's similar to how bosses and subordinates are looked at when they get together soon after some sort of prohibition is off.

2. A working adult dating someone fresh out of high school is in a position which screams ""manipulation,"" and the previous power imbalance doesn't help that image.

Really, I date a former student. I was teaching a night class PT at a university, and met a working adult taking continuing ed courses. We started dating maybe six months after I left the university, and have been together almost thirteen years. I **still** feel odd telling anyone the story, and insert all sorts of caveats about how it started and that I didn't date her (or even really know anything about her) when she was in my class. (Wow, I'm defending myself again! See?) Honestly, we both often lie and say we met at her tour agency while I was looking for a vacation. Anyway ... at that point, we were both well into our adult working lives, and yet people see how we met as a little creepy. The HS teacher / student relationship is just going to be ten times worse.

For some reason, I'm reminded of a pedophile joke:

&gt; Went to the pub with my girlfriend last night. Locals were shouting ""pedophile!"" and other names at me, just because my girlfriend is 21 and I'm 50. It completely spoiled our 10th anniversary.

I can see people trying to ""do the math"" on the kind of relationship you're describing."
highschoolteachers,"Science degree, definitely. I am a high school biology and marine science teacher in California and the breadth of knowledge you need to teach science is way bigger than most people think. It is always a good idea to have that background.

Not to mention, if you get tired of teaching (it happens), you will have something to fall back on that is not education related.

I am a newer teacher (3rd year). PM me if you have any questions!"
highschoolteachers,"First, take a deep breath and enjoy your Christmas break. ;)

Second, don't think yet about what you plan on doing after this year-- whether teaching or otherwise. Look at what is in front of you (second semester) and that's it. A really awesome, wise mentor teacher told me my first year that the best gift a teacher can give themselves is a second year, but you have to get through your first one first. 

I think that you should spend this break taking a good, long look at your personality and use the break to decide how your real personality will influence your professional one. This may be unsettling, but a teacher who lives a balanced life is not their full real self in the classroom and that's okay. Who you are at home, with your friends is not who you are in the classroom. You can care about your students and some of them may come to like you and your classroom, but there will always be a professional barrier that will make ""friendships"" with students in reality mentorships at best, that will keep you from losing your cool, and will let all their snide comments roll off your back at the end of the day.

If you are a sarcastic person IRL, you need to leave that at the door now. Even if it's sarcasm directed at yourself. Sarcasm is one of my favorite languages :), but I've learned over years of teaching elementary, middle, and high school that sarcasm is best only used in small amount WHEN you have developed a rapport and trust with your students, and ONLY then! (And in age-appropriate situations!)

Go on Amazon today and order the book ""Teach Like a Champion."" It will be a lifesaver and a career saver. Trust me. Even if you don't stay in teaching, you will want positive reviews from your peers this year. It's okay to struggle but show admin you're willing to work on those struggles.

Kids imitate so much. If you're using humor to poke fun at yourself, these kids may not yet fully grasp that your self-deprecation is not an invitation to join with you in making fun of yourself. So for right now, stop this humor as a classroom management tool. Find jokes you can make that are corny and going to make the kids roll their eyes, but not at your expense.

First years are lonely and hard and tiring and exhausting. It's hard to deal with attitude and not know anyone on staff well enough yet to seek out encouragement from them. But you have the ability to regain control of your class if you're willing to make certain changes, be humble, and learn to distance yourself from taking anything personally in teaching. My first year I had a class I never won over. But I took Christmas break to take a hard look at where I was losing them, started second semester saying ""I'm a new teacher and still learning what works and what doesn't. Here are new changes I am making for reasons x, y, and z. I'm telling you these things because I want you as my students to be aware of why I'm making these changes."" I never fully had rapport with those kids like I did future years, but I was able to get a better foothold and develop skills that let me create a classroom environment where I could build rapport with future kids. And I love what I do now. But that first year? They were mean and made me cry but at the end of the day, they were the kids and I was the professional and it was my job to make that change happen. And trust me, there are plenty of kids who want you to succeed because they don't want to waste class for a year. Also, I'm gonna note that my first year was in a small, private religious 6-12 school. If you are afraid of what admin is going to think of your teaching, then either something is wrong with admin or something is wrong with your teaching. I'm not saying this to condemn, I'm saying this to say that if there is a problem, it's only going to be fixed if you acknowledge that it's there.

You may dismiss comments in this thread saying I can't do what these other people are doing, or easy for you all to say with years under your experience. BUT we all had to start somewhere and we've all had poor experiences we brought upon ourselves. The teachers in this thread with multiple years of experience who are telling you that you need to make changes are saying this because we learned that in order to have any success we needed to get help. We found that help, we used other teacher's advice and demonstration lessons to change what wasn't working and slowly but surely found success.

Finally, GOOD free form teaching comes with years of experience. Don't write 2-3 page lesson plans for every prep, but have a plan and have a back-up plan (an extra activity if the lesson goes quickly) for every class. I have loads of advice so reply to this message with a comment if you'd like specific pointers but suffice to say I can only ""wing"" it now because I put in the hard work and time my first couple years.

Also, as a final note... classroom management is a science just as much as it's an art. It becomes an art when you've had years of experience in reading people and students and becoming better at building relationships with your classes. But it's a science and a science you can LEARN from books like ""Teach Like a Champion"" (srsly, GO READ IT). I just read it this year (in my fifth year!) and wish I'd had it my first year of teaching. And true, students won't be nearly as mean if they like you. But they'll still misbehave. ;) Trust me. I've gone through those days in November where you're just WAITING for Christmas break to get here and not as on the ball with management and my best kids who love me and I love them will goof off. It's not personal, I would've done the same. My favorite class in HS is the subject I'm teaching now and I ADORED the teacher who taught that subject but I wrote so many notes to friends during that class during independent work because I was a teen and friends were top priority. Kids will like you when they respect you. And they respect you when you give them the tools to respect you-- clear expectations, reasonable guidelines, ""fair"" consequences (I say ""fair"" because no consequences can ever be fully fair but you can implement them in a way that makes students feel like they are), and a 2-way street of respect, and showing students you CARE. If you don't want to hear them talk about inappropriate personal topics or don't want them sharing in class, simply say, ""hey student, I really am concerned that you are going through this, can you stay for a couple minutes after class and we'll talk?"" or just approach them after class. And even if you think it's stupid, still show you care, it will go a long way. I have spent SO much time learning about subjects I'll probably never show interest in outside of time with students, but you know what? I've built a rapport with these kids that makes my job and work worth it. So if I have to sit and listen about a YA book I'll never ever read (or want to read) but they leave the conversation feeling heard, AWESOME.

Hope this helps, reply if you want more specific lesson plan advice. Good luck.
"
highschoolteachers,"That's very uncharitable. Plenty of my high school students take my things because they simply don't realize that they are MY things and not part of THEIR classroom. They're entitled, not vicious."
highschoolteachers,"I use two different things in my advisory class: basic life skills and Fun Fridays. I created a basic life skills quiz for my kids (laundry, cooking, reading a map, responding to an emergency, social skills, money skills, etc.) then used it to see which basic life skills we should practice. When I taught the high school level, it was terrifying to see how many kids did not know their own address or how to read an analog clock.


I also use Fun Fridays. Students are asked to work on homework or read a novel the other days of the week; if they use their time well, we have Fun Friday. Each week I plan a high engagement object lesson in which kids participate, then we have a short discussion about it. 


As a few examples, 

Send several students  out of the room and create a variation on [The Asch Conformity Tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) 

Or our Tribes Activity: students were given basic instructions of how to communicate. Unknown to the students, each half of the class got a different set of instructions that were polar opposite (look the speaker in the eye vs. eye contact shows defiance or a challenge, maintain personal space vs. stand class to show interest, etc.). The only direction that is the same is that you should always ask the other person about their interests and avoid talking about yourself. The result is hilarious. We then can talk about cultural differences and how giving your best does not always look that way to others, so be careful before judging actions.

It can even be team building games, like the human knot or silent ball, which students weirdly love. Anything to bond with the class. "
highschoolteachers,This is another reason why i teach high school. I have a sign in and out system. One kid at a time. They manage it. Limits class disruptions. Ive warned them if its abused I'll issue passes per quarter. 
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Sorry if I made it seem like I don't respect kids but no offense but not being able to get beer for a party you shouldn't even be at is in my mind a pretty trivial problem. I'm pretty empathetic to a lot of my kids who have genuine problems, like my 4th grade class where all but one have divorced parents. That's tough shit. That's hard to deal with and I commend them for still being fairly happy most days. I don't have sympathy for a teen who's biggest issue is ""my mom grounded me for drinking""

Do you think they're actually talking about their serious problems in front of you? Of course they're not.

You talk about them like you're still in high school and you're still caught up in those social dynamics. It worries me massively.

&gt;But yes I'll admit i lack empathy in a lot of cases. But at the same time its crap to be sympathetic to someone who's biggest problem isn't that big. Should I bake a cake for a spoiled girl who is depressed because her mom got her fake uggs instead of real ones?

You do not know their lives.

I have already told you once that I find your disrespectful speech about your pupils unacceptable. You have chosen to repeat this unacceptable behaviour. If you were in my class, I would move you to an isolated area of the classroom now. If you repeated the behaviour again you would receive an appropriate punishment exercise and your parents would be informed of your behaviour. (see? behaviour management!) But you're not in my class, so all I can say to you is that if the attitude you have for your students shines through, it's no wonder they treat you like shit. People tend not to react well to people who despise them.

I've had spoiled kids before. They're frustrating. But the truth is that they're probably not getting discipline at home. They're probably not getting a lot of social attention. Their parents are buying them off ith material shit. The spoiled kids will usually get on board if you give them the shit they're deprived of elsewhere i.e boundaries, discipline, empathy and support. If you're not willing to give that to learners, get out of this profession immediately."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;You are right about this. It's just harder for me to see it with older kids.

That's where being empathetic and understanding comes in.

&gt;I mean their problems are usually their own doing. And in my case its mostly first world white kid problems.

Okay I'm going to have to come in right now with my teacher voice and tell you to cut that shit right now. You are talking about your pupils in an incredibly dismissive and cruel way and it is in no way whatsoever acceptable. You are the adult. Act like it. I've read your comments where you say your dad having cancer and being bullied made high school hard for you, were those first world white kid problems? I am amazed that someone who wants so much sympathy is so unwilling to extend the most basic level of empathy to his own students. If you have so many fucking excuses for why you can't do your job, why are you so unwilling to believe your kids might have valid reasons to be acting the way they are? 

&gt;I guess I feel the same way about kids in sped. They don't know any better and can't control their behavior and strangely enough I can handle it when someone doesn't know any better because I know its them so much as them being a victim of circumstances like a disorder.

You need to stop viewing misbehaviour as something that originates in a deficit in the child. Children's behaviour depends on the interplay between external forces (school, home, **you**), internal resources (their learned knowledge) and state of mind. You have control here."
highschoolteachers,"I want to turn the question around to you: 

Do you enjoy working with other people, especially high school students? Have you had some experiences working with high schoolers? Did you enjoy it? 

I ask this because teaching is not as much about the content as working with kids. Your main duties revolve around kids, managing a classroom, managing behavior, monitoring students for understanding, checking student assignments, facilitating student discussion, contacting parents etc. Creating an interesting lesson and actually teaching the content is part of teaching but you will find yourself working with the student for the majority of the time. 

If your reason to go into teaching is to make a difference then I would say you should reconsider. You only really feel like you made a difference at the end of the year as you are wrapping up just before final exams. Throughout the year it is a long slog working and building up your students and feeling like you are having a limited impact.

Try volunteering at a school, most public schools have some sort of volunteer system that you can sign up for. You could also call a school directly and offer yourself as a volunteer to help a teacher. 

Politics at the school varies from state to state, district to district and campus to campus. It is the luck of the draw. The best way to know is to ask teachers who are currently teaching in the districts that you are planning to teach in. In general though, schools are very top down organizations. The district adopts a new approach/program then suddenly the teachers are expected to follow along. School accountability puts a lot of pressure on core teachers to teach to the test and focus their energy towards the test. 

TLDR:""If it wasn't for the kids, I wouldn't continue being a teacher""

The graphic design path is a good path to pursue as well, if you really love working with clients and graphics then you may get more satisfaction from it. "
highschoolteachers,"Nah, I'm not going to give you any platitudes about respect - we all know the deal.

But not a jerk. You see, if your frame of reference is ""bullying"" vs. ""bullied,"" then if you're toward the ""bully"" side of that spectrum, you're in the ""jerk"" range, and if you're toward the ""bullied"" side then you're a ""victim."" You need to shift your frame of reference to ""adult teacher authority get-with-the-program"" vs. ""child student learner wants-structure-so-give-me-the-program.""

You're forthcoming about being bullied, and feeling powerless, and you're experiencing the exact same dynamics because you're back in high school. Screw high school. You're ""The Man"" now. But not ""The Dick."" That requires control, patience, and complete validity in your actions.

And you know something? As far as ""Respect is earned,"" you need to know that authority is earned as well. But it's best earned with a look, a quiet stare, or a quick reprimand and move on. Given that you mentioned a quick temper, I wonder if maybe you end up yelling or otherwise losing your cool in front of the class? If so, then know that there's no better way to lose respect, even if you keep your authority because you can enforce school rules. But respectful authority is the tough one. Have you experienced that? I'm not trying to be rude - reflection is an important part of teaching, and you should be asking yourself these sorts of questions, but you're not sure which questions to ask so you're turning to the hivemind."
highschoolteachers,"Loving literature and writing is great, but working with children is the most important aspect of teaching. Before making a decision, you should volunteer with or tutor high school students to see if it works for you."
highschoolteachers,"I'm not saying ""don't assign a grade,"" I'm saying that you shouldn't make kids *compete* for grades.

And candy is a crazy good incentive. Even high school kids bend over backwards to get candy."
highschoolteachers,"I do a very simple set of vocabulary terms with my middle schoolers, telling them that if they learn nothing else during their time with me, I want them to know that. They do fine with it through the end of the semester/year. Then they go to high school and get re-introduced to the same vocab, and the teachers at the high school are always saying ""Do you guys teach them this stuff?""

O_o"
highschoolteachers,"Second year teacher here. I student-taught in a continuation high school. My college faculty advisor told me if I can survive the internship, I will be able to teach anywhere. I survived, and was immediately offered a job at the same school. All you need to do is get to know your students. "
highschoolteachers,"I did something very similar to this in my AP government class in high school. We all picked a party and a topic and had to come to an agreement to prevent a ""Shutdown"" and grades were based on how well each party was willing to give. If your group had  ""Shutdown"" you received the lowest possible D"
highschoolteachers,"Your thinking here isn't individual- most kids in high school don't see the point in a lot of their learning. Try to remember that a lot of your learning isn't learning the knowledge, it's learning the skills to get more of that knowledge. So learning something like maths will develop your brain to be much better at stuff like critical thinking, spatial awareness, and so on. If you're not going to be a mathematician, you're not going to need the EXACT skill to develop theorems. But through learning theorems, you're going to be developing parts of your brain that will be useful for, say, being an electrician. 

I've never heard of those UK schools, and I've lived in the UK all my life. In England, minimum school leaving age is 17, and in Scotland, it's 16. You'd have to look up Wales and NI. 

I don't know how old you are, but if you've got 1-4 years left of high school, then that's 2-4 years of decades and decades of your life. If you can do what you want to do whenever, then cool. If there is a tiny possibility you may want to change careers in any year out of those decades, you could be kicking yourself for not just stepping up and finishing, especially as you seem to find it so easy. 

I dunno- you don't really seem to be taking on board anything I've said, so I'll leave you to make up your decision. I hope you read over what I and other commenters have said (and not just skim it- my first comment was me taking time to write something specifically for you, so it's kinda rude to say you just skimmed someone's comment. No matter how long it is, I am trying to help you.), and best of luck with your future."
highschoolteachers,"I've heard that there are schools in the UK that you cant test out of and get your diploma, but I may be wrong. My main problem with high school is I'm not learning anything useful to my future. I know that I'll never have a job that will require me to factor polynomials, or to balance a chemical equation, or to know what the Boston Massacre was. 

It's just stuff that isn't necessary and busy work."
highschoolteachers,"Not really sure what you mean by ""test out of high school""?

I live in Scotland (part of the UK), and at 16 (after 4th year too) you are allowed to leave school, and move out. I'm friends with a few of those guys on Facebook, and basically they're all in places they don't want to be. Not saying there's anything wrong with being hairdressers or whatever, but that's not what they want to be doing and they just got impatient.

To be honest, I'm struggling with uni right now. I dislike the course, I find teacher education personally boring, and so on. I have a year and a half left. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and revising for exams I don't want to take seems pointless. But I know as soon as I graduate, I don't have to do this any more. I can use my degree for a multitude of jobs, not just teaching. Maybe see a career advisor and think about that.

For 2 years of high school, all I wanted to do was be a teacher. Now I'm actually doing it, I've realised it's just not for me. I think it's stupid getting kids to take tests and decide on their futures before they're even 18.

One final thing- I have NEVER seen a college/uni say ""we accept online course certificates"". 

My advice would be to go to prospects.ac.uk (british site but anyone can do it), make an account, do the career planner, which is a test, then you get a list of careers you'd be good at. It helped me a lot."
highschoolteachers,"One high school a friend resigned from had a filthy staff room and the principal would not supply enough milk in case teachers used it on their breakfast. A staff room with plentiful tea, coffee, milk etc and basics like salt, pepper and butter really does wonders for morale. Also, that school didn't have sufficient women's toilets (or hygene disposal units) and they were not cleaned properly. you don't care about your staff if you don't look after their physical needs. 

Have to agree with others about support when handling difficult parents and also in recognising the work people do. Some teachers leave at 3:30 with their handbags as they use technology to plan lessons and mark work but never get acknowledged while others stay at work until six doing the same work. Some teachers have great classrooms, others always take the lowest sports team every year. Praise and acknowledge the work teachers do, as often they only hear the next thing they have to do, and the things they aren't doing right. 

Also, share the learning opportunities. Often the same people get many opportunities to develop, while other teachers get none. If you want all students to succeed, all teachers have to be given a chance to grow, not just selected staff. This goes to social events like an end of term meal. Make sure everyone is welcome and ensure they have a good time, not just certain staff members. 

Don't get me started on the biggest morale killers of teaching- initiative overload and blatant overwork. Look at timetables and if you have a heavy week, skip staff PD, meetings etc.

One school I know has a wellness programme for staff that includes weekly goals like 'leave work by 4' week and 'being your water bottle to work' week with silly prizes for staff (again, not the same ones every week as this kills morale).
 Another has Friday Flowers where one teacher gets given flowers for something they did and the next week they give some to another teacher however these were passed around the same teachers every week so 2/3 of staff never got them and it was a morale killer. 


However, there is also a tradition in my country of a wooden spoon award for a mighty (but funny) mistake e.g. Forgetting to go to a class, misspelling the same word on every report, driving a sports team to the wrong place etc. 

Keep it fair, be considerate and include everyone and morale is good. And maybe get a coffee machine if you don't have one. Teachers love coffee. 
"
highschoolteachers,That's rough. :( Although I guess for high school it is a little different than elementary/middle.
highschoolteachers,"I think that the teacher who praised me on it was the third teacher (the other two were both history teachers too) to realize how much I don't care about school.

The second I get out of high school, I'm going to start working towards my master electricians license, which last I saw, I don't even need to have a diploma to get.

Haha, I could totally see people saying that, too. I also understand where everyone is coming from with the whole 'this will matter in the future' and 'think about your teachers' things. But, I have a hard time really caring. That makes me sound kinda shallow and a lot like a teenager.."
highschoolteachers,"kinda tl:dr, skimmed over it.

I just want to get out of high school. It's boring, repetitive, and a general waste of time. I switched to online school because I was tired of going to school for 8 hours a day just to only do like 2 hours of work, the rest being stupid kids who ask questions about everything and all the busy work. When I did online school, I spent 1 hour a day, max, on it. It was simple and I passed with mostly A's and B's (I did slack off a lil' bit.). The only reason I went back to normal school was because I missed my friends and people. But now I'm back to the point of 'why am I wasting so much time on this?' 

If I could just test out of high school like they do in the UK, and move on with my life, that would be great. "
highschoolteachers,"I had asked my teacher what he would do if someone did get a 0 on the final a couple weeks before this. I behave very well in all my classes, do what is asked, turn in work on time, and have very good grades. This was just a decision on my end that no one knew about until it happened.

Going to high school is something that is forced. I'm only here because I have to be. I don't plan on going to a 4 year college. Maybe a community college if I absolutely have to. 

I had a 97% in that class before this. Now my grade went down to an 84%. Still one of the higher grades in that class."
highschoolteachers,"If you want to create a piece of software, design something that easily schedules students classes in high school. "
highschoolteachers,"1. Yes,  email principals. Many times I have been told that is the way to be noticed.  Plus,  it shows you are interested and not just randomly applying.  In your email I would put something you like about the school but not like a - hey,  I've been stalking the school type of thing. For example: I applied at the high school majority of my in laws attended and was able to speak highly of the district and school in an email based off of what they've told me and their education.  Make sense?  
2. Subbing or volunteering is a great way to check out a school.  Look at the PTA involvement and programs.  Also see if you can maybe find a way to see the teachers interact with each other.  I have found that to be incredibly valuable.  My school last year had very little teacher interaction.  No talking or waving in the parking lot,  no good morning,  nothing.  During an interview I was lucky enough to see a staff meeting being dismissed so I saw all of the staff laughing and interacting,  talking in the parking lot etc.  I love my job and coworkers.  I couldn't say that before.  My school doesn't even have a PTA but our teachers make up for that.  Just a few examples.  :)
3. If you are going to move,  do it now.  No offense but once you are sucked in,  it's kind of hard.  Plus,  some states have different requirements and tests. This will save you from starting over.  On the other hand,  being a first year teacher,  I'd recommend staying where you know you could get a job.  It's 50/50. You'd have a job and experience to move out of state after a year or two,  but then you might have to do the tests again.  I have researched the crap out of this type of situation because I live in the desert also and like you,  I would love the Pacific Northwest.  
4. Wait and see what the school provides and what your room looks like.  You might look around for ideas for lessons and keep a folder (or pinterest)  etc for that kind of thing.  
 
Best wishes!!! "
highschoolteachers,You should see at the high school. Parents are funny when they give gifts. I got a great Godiva gift set on the one hand...and a bottle of wine on the other.
highschoolteachers,"Nope. My sat scores were high enough to not require a praxis one. 

I have passed praxis ii exams in secondary mathematics, secondary social studies, and elementary reading. I have heard of math majors failing the praxis II (0061) but I think that's just because there is very little advanced math on it. There's a smattering of linear algebra and there's always one abstract algebra question that isn't too tough (""is this function commutative, associative neither?) but the calculus doesn't go beyond derivatives. A sufficiently advanced high school education in mathematics is all it took me to pass it, along with a study group..."
highschoolteachers,-_- I would say a bunch of jobs do not offer any form of job training. I would kill to have learned some of these skills as a high school student as they would have also helped me get into a better college.
highschoolteachers,This makes me feel better as an 18 year old who just got charged with possession and paraphernalia. I'm gonna get it expunged but I'm still really worried I'll have to report it as a dropped charge when I apply to teach high school..
highschoolteachers,I took it last year.  Remember that the questions are deliberately clustered around the median in terms of difficulty. I hadn't taken math since high school and got a 170--that should give you some idea. 
highschoolteachers,"I'm going to start out by saying that this seems like a really specific goal that you have--depending on the state that you are in, getting a teaching job can be *very* competitive right now, even for someone who is certified. Also, because you're looking for something with such specific requirements, I feel like it would be hard a job available that fits your criteria. Not that that means you shouldn't try! I'm not
trying to be a downer.

I would start beefing up my resume now, if I were you. You probably have enough credits that you could sub for your local high schools. Figure out what sub company the districts around you use and take whatever steps you need in order to sign up, so that you can sub once college classes end. You could tutor local high school students in your chosen subjects--maybe ask your college's school of ed if they can help you set up contacts there. If you have a teacher from your high school that you are still close to, you could ask to shadow them for a day or two. You could also see if any of your local high school will need a coach or a club leader for something you are experienced in. Your RA experience will also look good on a resume!"
highschoolteachers,"Right? I know in my city there was a huge problem with the district (which is unaccredited, btw) firing all the non-tenured teachers and replacing them with TFAs because...drum roll...it saved them $12,000 per teacher per year. 

I met a 2nd year TFA who was head of her department at her high school. She came to our Education Major Senior Seminar (Capstone) to recruit ""real teachers"" to be tutors for her high school.  Are you kidding me?! She told us it would look good on our resumes. She was oblivious to the reality of the situation: we were all more qualified, and yet she had the job we wouldn't be considered for because money.

"
highschoolteachers,"I talk about things on Reddit with my students all the time. But I teach high school ESL and Reddit is in English. So.....totally legit, right? :)"
highschoolteachers,"There is so much good advice here already. I've been teaching middle school and high school for 15 years now. I have found you need to start the year out right. You are walking into a classroom of up to 30 unknowns. Start out stricter than you are comfortable with. Remember, strict does not equate to mean. Set your expectations for behavior and quality of work high and hold the students to them. If you find after the year has started that the current class is mature enough to handle you loosening up a little, joking a little, having a little more independent work time - by all means do so. But remember, it's easier to loosen up on the reigns than trying to reign in a class that has gotten out of hand.

Also, one survival technique: you don't have to grade every scrap of paper that comes across your desk. You are already going to be pressed for time in your personal life as well as your professional life. Pick and choose the assignments you grade, call the assignments you don't grade student practice.

Now the weird one: find your teacher voice. It's different than your conversational voice. It's also different than anybody else's teacher voice. One thing I can tell you - it's not a shout or a yell. It carries conviction and confidence. It shows that you care, but also demands respect. Once you find it, use it on students AND their parents.

You've chosen a hard career, but one that is worthy of your time and effort.

Good luck and have fun!"
highschoolteachers,"Finished my high school teaching degree last year; was doing relief first the first half of this year and got my own classes around August. Am a young female:

Prepare lessons within an inch of their life; then prepare some more.

Always have backup plans for your backup plans and include extra work incase kids finish earlier than expected. 

You're gonna be tired, sleep when you can and warn your friends you may not be available for a certain period of time. 

Ask questions, steal resources, and if you can, watch other teachers teach to see different techniques. Pick the strategies that you think will suit you best and start there. Your own personal strategy will evolve once you figure out what works best for you. 

Learn the kids names as soon as humanly possible. The power of using a kids name when they're misbehaving is unimaginable. Also, kids respond well when you make the effort to get to know them. "
highschoolteachers,"My disclaimer is that I teach high school and am young...

Dress more professionally than they tell you to.  You may catch some hell for it (I did) but it cut down on kids thinking I was their friend because I was only a few years older than them.  A shirt and a tie really cut down on classroom management stuff.... Though, that brings me to point 2....

2..... Classroom management will be your biggest struggle, it is for everyone I've ever spoken to.  You love your content, you can talk about it on end and create engaging lessons, and some kid is still going to complain and bitch and talk back and throw stuff....  Focus on that.  

3...  You're going to fail a few times (or more)...  Be willing to change.  Be humble, you don't know everything yet and realistically, you don't know anything yet about classroom stuff.

4....  Have fun.  Enjoy your time there, enjoy your kids, joke sometimes.  You'll be much happier.

5...  Be nicest to the custodial staff and the office staff.  If a position opens up, they'll be your most trusted recommendation to the Administration. 

And finally, ask a shitload of questions and steal all the resources you can get.

If this wasn't enough, feel free to pm me and we can chat.  I was in residency not long ago."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math. I agree with arguments on both sides too. At this point in my career, I'm working these on a case by case basis. For example , today I was in a parent conference with a student and was asked if the student could turn in late work for credit . I said he can do it and I will happily look over it for him, but he won't receive credit for the assignments. However , if he does the assignments for an entire unit, showing me he has actually practiced the content, I will allow him to retake the quiz and/or test for that unit (which ultimately would have a better effect anyway). I figure with exams coming up, at least it would have him studying something. I don't advertise it . If kids ask me about it though, I may do it once in a while. "
highschoolteachers,"Age and circumstance may limit us, but there is no such thing as a lost cause. I see so much positive growth at the high school level - this kid is far from being a lost cause."
highschoolteachers,"Oh, that's too bad then. I had a 2.5 hour break each tuesday and thursday in my last year of high school which is when I did it. I wouldn't worry about it though, it sounds like you are doing plenty!"
highschoolteachers,"I teach very low level high school kids. Sometimes the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, as terrible as that sounds. Let the kid know you truly want to help him (which I'm sure he knows already at this point) and will extend the hand if he is willing to grasp for it. Education is a two way street. Unless a kid wants to learn, there is not much we can do beyond try our hardest to get them there... But like I said, they have to make the jump."
highschoolteachers,"I'm not a veteran, but I'm a current student teacher enrolled in a year long immersion student teaching program.  I work in a very economically depressed city, so some of the behavior I have had to deal with has been pretty extreme.

To answer your questions:

1. The worst behaviors I have had to deal with have mainly been students who simply do not care about any consequence you throw at them.  I know this is a broad Explanation, but the kids who care about grades and consequences are pretty easy to work with.  The behavior that you will see from kids who simply don't care can be really difficult.  If you are not in a high poverty area, I wouldn't expect this to be as much of a problem, but I have seen some crazy stuff.  We had one kid who tried to break one the door by smashing it with his body. Where I work there are a lot of gang affiliated middle schoolers so I've had to deal with kids who see violence and drugs on a daily basis.  

2. Every day I feel a little bit more comfortable with my instructional abilities and classroom management.  Both are areas that require development, and you should expect to be a little shaky at first.  After 4 months of student teaching I feel comfortable in front of the class, and most of my fellow student teachers do as well.  Don't worry if you feel awkward up there at first, it will come with time.

3. Making lesson plans is still a challenge for me, especially because I'm getting my masters, and doing a lot of work for that after school.  Use the Internet, it kind of feels like cheating but it really isn't if the lessons are good. Oftentimes I take lesson plans from the Internet and tweak them to what I think will work better with my kids.  Also, try to find a good veteran teacher of your subject in your school and ask them for advice and resources.

4. Google.  If you're a history teacher I can recommend the ""resourcesforhistoryteachers"" page on wikispaces, or the Stanford history education group site.  I can guarantee if you google ""______ lesson plan"" you will find something although a lot of online lesson plans are garbage so you'll have to weed out the good ones. Also there's an app called class dojo that I use on a daily basis and has worked wonders.  Each student from each class gets a little monster that has their name under it, and you can award them points for good work and behavior, or take away points for bad behavior.  It's great because you can give rewards to the kids with the most points, and send home weekly reports for the parents of kids with negative points.  It might be better in middle school than high school but you should at least check it out.

5. Being that the school I work at has no money, I have little experience with using technology.  The few times that we've used the computer lab, I have had issues with keeping kids on task.  I really can't help too much with that, although class dojo can probably be an effective way to incentivize good behavior in general.

6. Get some sleep and relax every now and then.  If you are getting your masters, or working another job (or both like me) then you're gonna probably end up pretty stressed out.  Make sure you're getting enough sleep and unwinding every now and then. You'd be amazed the difference it makes for your abilities if you are well rested.  Also, don't beat yourself up if you have a bad day.  It's gonna happen, but most of my best days come after bad days.  Instead of getting down on yourself, think of what went wrong, and how it could have gone better.  The next day, focus on those areas and try new things.  I would also suggest you find the best teachers in your school and observe what they do.  I've learned most of my best techniques and strategies from veterans in my school.  Also, you're gonna learn to hate standardized tests.  There's nothing you can do about it, but the time in the classroom will make it all worth it!

"
highschoolteachers,I had block scheduling when I was in high school in the '90s. Probably prepared me to sit through long lectures in college.
highschoolteachers,"At the start of the new semester, I will be switching from a points based grading system to a percentage based grading system.  Right now, daily rehearsals, voice lessons, concerts, and worksheets are all worth a certain amount of points and are just added up and that determines their grade (I teach high school choir).  I didn't do a very good job of determining how many points each category should be worth, so students who do not deserve an A currently have an A.  In January, each of those categories will be worth a certain percent of their grade and their grades will more accurately reflect their attendance and participation in class. "
highschoolteachers,"Hello, I went to a career advisor recently to try and switch degrees and told him my grades. He was surprised I got into uni with them. My grades (which are Scottish Highers) are: Music A, English B, History C. I've also got other qualifications which are kind of like semi-highers, they're called Intermediate 2's. I got an A for maths and art and French. Int. 2's aren't university-getting qualifications, highers are the important ones.
They said they wanted 2 A's and 2 B's in Highers. Lol.

Anyway, it wasn't my grades that got me in (clearly). It was the huuuge amount of experience I had- I did everything I could, like babysitting, childminding, helping out with youth groups, working in a nursery, working in a primary school for a project, then going back to the primary school to work some more. 

edit: Our high schools have 6 years here. You do Intermediate 2's from 4th to 5th, and highers in 5th. You do other qualifications in 6th year but you need to send off your application before you know your results.

Get as much experience as you can!!! That's what will help you. Wish you could just take my place at uni as this is hell :)"
highschoolteachers,"""College isn't even on their radar yet.""  Really?  I would assume that's true if they aren't college bound to begin with, but if they are planning to go to college, they are smart enough to realize every grade they get while in high school counts.  In any case, if your school has jupitergrades, it's awesome.  There is so much transparency about your grades (they are posted online for parents and students to log in to see), that it's almost impossible for a parent or student to claim they were blindsided by their grade.  Plus, I can even see when the last time a parent has logged in.  ""I check his grades all the time.""  ""Really?  According to this it says you haven't even logged in to change the default password.""  It's a great program.  "
highschoolteachers,"I'm so sorry. I'm not gonna tell you that there was nothing you could've done and not to feel guilty because although that is true, I can only assume I would feel the same way. Just 5 minutes before I read your post I learned a student at the high school in the town in which I teach has died. It probably makes me an asshole but I thanked god I didn't have him. I can't stand the thought of one of my kids hurt or dead. So yeah, I'm very sorry this happened to one of your kids."
highschoolteachers,"I taught for high school biology/chemistry for three years and decided to make a career move. I am a software engineer now and thoroughly love my job. There is much more autonomy, much less politics and stress, and I really enjoy coding. It also pays much better which doesn't hurt either.

Deciding to leave teaching was a tough decision for me to make at the time. I felt like I really started to figure some things out and actually begin to serve as a resource for my own peer teachers during my third year and I found I was enjoying the job more and more. But it was still a ton of stress and work and I didn't feel like I could sustain it for an entire career as I am somewhat of an introvert and find being around huge groups of people all day to be exhausting for me, even though it can be fun and enjoyable at times. Looking back though, I don't regret making the move, and see teaching as the most stressful and difficult job I ever had, as rewarding as it can be.

The catch is I had to go back to school and earn a Master's degree to make the move, so I had to spend two years not pulling a paycheck and now have that extra debt hanging over me, which many folks may not have the flexibility to do. But for me, between the increased enjoyment, reduced stress and better pay it was a no-brainer."
highschoolteachers,One of my high school teachers gave me _Teacher Man_ by Frank McCourt (author of _Angela's Ashes_. It's a fantastic read!
highschoolteachers,"I agree with this for the lower grades, but not for high school. I have seen too many math/science teachers who have absolutely no clue what they are talking about subject-wise. At that level, that is more disastrous than not knowing pedagogy."
highschoolteachers,"If you want to teach at a secondary level (middle or high school), you'd need more schooling anyway to get certified. You get your bachelor's in what you want to teach, and then you go through a teaching certification program. These days, there are many master's in teaching programs that get you your certification and your master's, which puts you at a higher pay rate when you start teaching. Honestly, that's the way to go, even if it means more schooling upfront.

Additional endorsements/certs for other subjects will vary in terms of how much coursework is required. I'd suggest getting in touch with the education department at the school(s) you plan to transfer to."
highschoolteachers,"Are you in high school?

You are worrying too much.  Talk to your guidance counselor if you are very upset, they will have answers.

Once you get into college your HS GPA doesn't really matter."
highschoolteachers,"The general rule is - once you've gone through college everything that happened before college is irrelevant to your employers. Nobody - and I mean NOBODY - cares about your high school grades once you get through college.

Obviously you should try not to get Ds and Cs. Colleges might care when they are accepting your application and some schools might care what college you went to, so it matters in some sense. But if you get into college, graduate college with a decent GPA and a cert, nobody will even care if you once upon a time got a bad grade in high school."
highschoolteachers,"Thanks for your input! I do reach out to teachers as much as possible, it's definitely the best way to facilitate collaboration :)

I noticed you used all articulation (lisps/sound errors) examples; in your experience, is that what the SLP at your school mostly treats? I know it's different at the elementary school level, but we honestly only have 3 kids on a caseload of 70 (across a middle and high school) that I treat for sounds alone. 

Since you teach special ed, I'm interested in your collaboration with the SLP. At my schools, I push-in to the mod-severe rooms to co-teach lessons with the special ed teachers (News 2 You lessons, prepping for community outings, all kinds of things) and I'm very involved with the mod-severe population. The special ed teachers and I are always sharing ideas for using AAC, our Circle of Friends club, behavior and reinforcers, what's worked for certain students, etc etc. 

What kind of relationship do you have with your SLP? Does he/she do push-in with you?"
highschoolteachers,"I guess I can see where this is a difference between high school &amp; middle school, then. I have 150 students, mostly juniors/seniors, many of whom are in AP or college-level classes. Grading their essays moves much more into that subjective territory and requires a fair bit of nuance to help nudge them in the right direction. Even a few margin comments + a 3 sentence end comment ends up taking 10-20 minutes, depending on the assignment. High school English tests also tend to move pretty far away from the types of multiple choice questions you describe, too, especially when you get into literary analysis and arguing *how well* writers use techniques. 

Add to high school the additional requirements on English teachers -- writing letters of rec and giving feedback on college essays being the 2 biggest timesucks that don't affect middle school teachers too much. 

I guess what I'm saying is to maybe be a little less strident in your judgment that ""if you're staying late you're doing it wrong."" You may be in a school &amp; circumstance that allows you to get out of the building at 3:30 every day, which is great, but that doesn't mean you've cracked the code and everyone else should be judged because they're not as lucky. Trust your fellow teachers when they say that it is impossible to get all their work done within the confines of the school day. You might be in a good position, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't help advocate for change in the profession as a whole. "
highschoolteachers,"I can try!  I work primarily in elementary and prek so maybe it's way different when you are in high school (and should be?)

From a behavioral psychology standpoint, all behaviors happen for one of 4 reasons. Attention. Escape/avoidance. Access to tangible items. Sensory.  When you break down to a specific behavior (in this instance hitting) and look at what happened immediately before and after it, this gives a pretty accurate hypothesis for which of the 4 this falls under.  If you react to it and it happens more often, its likely attention. If you have withheld an item they want and they hit it's access to tangible. If you send the to the principal every time and it happens more often it's likely escape or avoidance of your class.

Family life, drugs, whatever are all factors that make it more likely to happen (setting events), but at their core each particular smaller behavior happens for one of those reasons.  

If it's attention, you ignore it. You do not give attention to the behavior after it happens and it makes it less likely to happen in the future because they learn they get nothing out of doing it. They reliably don't get the reinforcement for doing it and it won't happen in the future. 

Yes, this isn't how the real world is and I get that. BUT if you ignore it in the school setting and the behavior decreases or is eliminated it is way more likely to not happen in the real world either. A school is a contrived situation where you can control what gets reinforced and what doesn't. If you can eliminate these behaviors at school (and try to get parents to do so at home) they will generalize this to the real world too because they haven't had the behavior reinforced, but have had socially acceptable (and easier) replacement behaviors reinforced.

Of course, you should ALWAYS teach a socially acceptable replacement behavior that gives the student access to the same reinforcement. 

In this case, if the hit was for attention you would teach the student to call out your name or raise their hand to get your attention. Or even say ""I am so mad and want you to pay more attention to me."" Anything that you would accept like this.

If it was to escape, which seems like another very strong possibility (say he hated your class and you sent him to the principal once he hit you, thus escaping the class he dowsnt want to be in) you would make him stay in the class no.matter what. If he did.it to.avoid your.class (before your class even started) you would do the same. But you would teach them to say ""I need a break"" and give them access to one at a mpre appropriate time and help them figure out a way to get any work they miss done.

Make any sense?"
highschoolteachers,"Well, that isn't always true.  As a high school English teacher with a pile of critical analysis essays to grade before break, I don't think I'm ""doing it wrong"" having to stay late to grade them.  Normal classwork and tests can be graded during my prep and duty period, but that's not possible with 85 essays.    
"
highschoolteachers,Oh yeah I do. And actually because my school is an academy of performing arts and a high school they get a grant to cover all the art supplies they need. Lucky
highschoolteachers,"How about the # of apps for international high school jobs?

I can imagine them getting tons of applications but relatively few from qualified candidates."
highschoolteachers,"I appreciate your difference of opinion. Like I said, since I went through a very similar situation two months ago, I wanted to explain what worked for me.

For 1, 2, and 4, I'm certain that we just fundamentally disagree on the best pedagogical styles. However, for 3, I didn't realize they were in grade 3. I likely wouldn't ask a third grade student how to improve my class. I teach high school, and I 100% disagree with ""If you want to find out how to make a lesson better, ask other professionals"". With high school students, if you make them feel like they are a part of the learning process, and give them choices of how their class is arranged, they will respect you more. When I want to find out how to engage a student, I ask the student first. Even if they have no suggestions (which is usually the case), they will be glad you asked and it can help the teacher-student relationship."
highschoolteachers,"What's the next letter in the sequence?
TTFFSS?  Then, to rub it in (or call it a hint), you can say, ""If a first grader walked in here, he would know this pattern.  100% you all know this pattern.  I mean, it's something even a preschooler would be familiar with."" 
The answer is E.  Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight.  My 7th graders get pretty unhappy about not figuring this one out.

You could do - TTFSS?  Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sat, Sun, Monday.  That's pretty good too- if they are sharp they'll get this one.

Or what I've done is I'll take 40 recent movie titles and spell them out phonetically and they'll have to figure out the movie.  It's a good group activity and it's quiet (they don't want other groups steal their answers).  For example,

Duh Unk Her Cames 

Dumb Ace Run Her

Hinders Tell Her  

Card He Hands Off Dug Alex He

The Hunger Games
The Maze Runner
Intersteller
Guardians of the Galaxy

It's funny when you know the answers listening to them read it and not get it.  They will be sounding out the words, and you'll be like, ""How can you not know it?  You are totally saying it!""

Or you can do a scavenger hunt at their desks.  Four students make a group, and then you give them a list of things they need to have from their backpacks- but no getting up.  Paperclips, a library card, empty soda can, three keys, etc.  Scoring it is a bit of a pain though.  

You could do bingo.  25 squares with each box containing a phrase like, ""is left handed"", or ""can sing the alma mater"", or ""plays two sports"", ""went out of state this past year"", etc.  Each person has to go around the room and have someone sign in the box that applies to them.  You can only sign a person's card once.  First person to get all boxes signed wins.  Downside is that there is a lot of movement and noise because kids get excited.  Plus, you'll never know if the person signing the box ACTUALLY ""has three dogs"".  But whatever, it's a game.

Name that theme song.  This takes a little time, but you can grab tv themes off youtube, and string together a bunch of them.  They work in teams to try to solve as many as they can.  You be surprised how many will start singing along to the theme to Dora, or Sesame Street, or Barney.  

Name that logo.  Get a bunch of logos of the internet, create a slideshow, and have the kids name off as many as they can.  You'll have to put in a few more obscure ones, otherwise they'll know all of them (it's shocking how good a job advertisers have done in branding their logos).  

Name that movie.  Go to wikipedia and find the top movies of 2013/2014.  Then google ""scene from (name of movie)"".  Save the pic and make a slide show- team that guesses the most wins.

You could have everyone get an index card and write down three true facts about themselves and one fake one.  Then you pull a card, and read the person's name and their four ""facts"".  Have the class vote on which one they think is the fake one.  Start off with one about you- that's always fun for the kids.  ""No way!  YOU were on your high school Homecoming Court?  YOU!??!?!?!""  "
highschoolteachers,"I just got hired halfway through last semester after a teacher quit. I started teaching three high school math classes on one day's notice. I made it through the semester, but I was extremely busy. Here's what I learned:

1. If they are reasonable people, they will lower their expectations for you due to the circumstances. They understand it's difficult to start partway through the year.

2. Ask for as much resources as possible. Get everything that past teachers have. Hopefully they can provide you with a semester plan. This will really save time, and you can always adjust it to match your style.

3. Don't ask too many questions. You're fully educated in this field. There is no reason why you should have trouble getting the job done.

4. Go easy on the students. It is not ideal for them to get a new teacher partway through, so be understanding of this. Start off slow, get to know them (do some sort of activity on your first day that helps with this), make sure they respect you, and then slowly but surely demand more and more from them.

5. Do some diagnostic assessment with the students to gauge how they learn and how much they've learned. Ask them for suggestions on how to make your lessons better. This is also the best way to react to a student that is being disruptive or not doing their work. If they can't think of a way for you to make the class better (and you can't either), then the responsibility is on them to take greater initiative.

6. Get adequate sleep. It is better to be slightly unprepared but well-rested, then fully prepared and sleep-deprived. "
highschoolteachers,"100% agree. My daughter (who is in high school now and still 2 years ahead in math) was able to be in the 3rd grade ""math group"" as a first grader, and so on. It allows for so much more flexibility in instruction than a standard classroom. The only concern I ever had was that sometimes the more advanced students ended up spending more time as peer tutors than learning new, advanced material, but for the most part their school managed that pretty well. "
highschoolteachers,Glad to hear he's doing well! I'm high school so I'm not as well versed on early years but some new toilet time tules/routines migh be beneficial just so that you can rule out the environmental possibility.
highschoolteachers,"I'm a black teacher, who was once a black student in a majority black high school. The white teachers we trusted  earned that trust. Mainly by treating students fairly. Just be a fair, honest teacher and you'll be fine. "
highschoolteachers,"Wow. Ok, so as a high school teacher, I realize my view of this is different than yours. But it seems like you're having a slight overreaction to head lice. 

Yes, it's a parasite and it's icky and contagious. But there aren't any serious side effects. She treated herself AND she told you about it so you could be on the lookout. Seems to me it was really none of your business anyway. 

I would be more upset about someone coming to work with a cold. Also contagious and actually does more damage. Have you ever experienced head lice yourself? I don't get why you're so upset.  "
highschoolteachers,"Sorry about that. Started the reply on the iPad but it took too long. 

First thing you need to know about becoming a history teacher is that you will NOT necessarily be teaching your dream class right away. Not many first year teachers get an AP High School gig. It's usually earned after many years of practice. Many of the kids will not be as passionate about history as you (in fact, most of them will actually hate history). 

Second: Teaching is NOT like the movies. You will most likely be in a rough school for your first couple of years dealing with 70% behavior issues, 20% mandated activities (non-fiction reading skills), and only 10% content. I'm just as passionate about history as you and was shocked at the very little amount of autonomy I was given to teach the topics I like the way I want to. 

You have connections so you definitely want to use them to your advantage. You might be able to skip the middle school years and go right to high school. As a new teacher, you won't be given the opportunity to teach the AP and Honors classes until  you have done your time with the CP level classes. 

As for college, you will probably have to adjust your work hours a bit, as undergrad education classes (and all of your practicum and student teaching) are mostly taken during the day. This may differ depending on the size of the university. You'll need to take around 30 credits of history courses and 30 education credits. Shouldn't take more than 3 years. Find a program that has a good relationship with local schools so your student teaching placement isn't a pain in the ass. You will not be able to work during student teaching so take that into consideration. 

I'm in my first year and although I'm grateful to be in a great school, I have really struggled. I always heard other people talking about how the first year was hell. I never believed them; always thought ""that's them! I'll be different."" Well, I'm not lol. I'm struggling with differentiation, scaffolding, classroom management, lesson planning, etc. Would I trade it in for the jobs I had before teaching? Absolutely not! I'm told that the more experience I get, the better I'll become, and the more I'll enjoy the job. I'm hoping that day comes sooner rather than later. "
highschoolteachers,"My gym class was around 70 minutes long, but they still only allowed us a bare minimum of time to change before and after class.

Now that I'm a teacher, I have yet to work in a school that even requires kids to dress down for gym. (I've taught at middle and high schools.)"
highschoolteachers,"I remember the day when my nephew's feet first blossomed.  Shoes removed, and the aroma of fermented something hit the air.  

Smells are powerful memory activators.  I remembered smells of Scandinavian rotten fish from when I was a little kid, aged foul-smelling cheese which had also gone spoiled in our refridgerator (I was in high school then), the time in college when sewage almost (but not quite!) backed up through our sinks, and when I moved in to our first home, and our cable guy installed our cable, then notified us of the two dead opossums underneath our house.  

To me, a smell so powerful that it was, literally, an entire lifetime of stink from that boy's feet."
highschoolteachers,I'm assuming this is more for elementary and middle schools? I would imagine for high school students they would be a little harder to convince?
highschoolteachers,"Ready...?

Once upon a time we tried to integrate schools based solely on race. We knew it was the right thing, but around 1975 it cooled down with a court case - Miliken v Bradley. 

Since that time schools have continued to become more and more segregated, by race and income. This in and of itself isn't problematic. 

Now we give kids standardized tests. We have decades of performance data. Even if the test is shit, it's consistent taken in the aggregate and over time. We have evidence of the disparity of performance. 

Let's take this a step farther. CA tests students on their readiness for college. Again, same shitty test conditions. This shows, in spite of grad rates in the 90s, math scores sit lower than 5 %. 

Remember all of that student loan debt. Yeah kids are taking on debt to take high school classes in college

A broken clock is right at least twice.  "
highschoolteachers,"I work with the higher level grades (10-12) basically the last 3 years of high school. 

Thank you, I like your advice on making them eli5 as well as doing something media based on a topic to make it more interesting. 

One of my classes is a film study class and I think they would take to that project very well. :) "
highschoolteachers,"That is the question I am now posing to parents and teachers alike.  Now that I'm an administrator and I've moved a K-8 system to standards based grading it really exposes a lot of those grading elephants in the room.  Teachers using grades as a carrot and stick become problematic when the real question is ""can the student do standard X."" I've had to have a number of conversations on how teachers can encourage behaviors without attaching grades to the behaviors.

When you have teachers that give numerous extra credit opportunities (sometimes not even connected to content), it often either causes greater than 100% grades or is used as a crutch for a class that is too difficult.  So in the new system I've had to move the phrase ""extra credit"" to ""extra chances."" At the end of the day, if the kid can do the work, what does it matter (if teaching the work is the goal)?

(I know my earlier post in this thread talks about points for behavior but that was when I taught high school under a different grading system.)"
highschoolteachers,"I'm student teaching in a high school science classroom, and my students never follow spoken directions or read directions on paper. Let me know what you figure out."
highschoolteachers,"There are high highs, and low lows when it comes to teaching. I'll be honest that for me, I see more low lows. But those moments when there's a high, it mostly makes up for it. This is my first year teaching full-time from the beginning of the year (I had two other jobs where I took over from other teachers and I was MISERABLE), and some of my classes are just a semester long. It's so nice when former students come by to say hi (and sometimes really surprising to see who it is!), or ask my opinion on some aspect of their life. I've been really working with my sophomores this year on critical thinking skills, and today we had small groups presenting new laws and their reasoning behind them. The rest of the class had GREAT questions, really coming up with amazing reasons why there might be problems with the laws and forcing everyone to analyze their opinions and support them with facts. I sat in a desk as a student, raising my hand when I had a question too, so the kids presenting could feel like they were really leading the class. There was some chaos, for sure, but I was super happy to see kids having some great debates.

Tomorrow's our statewide writing test, which my sophomores have to pass to pass high school. I've given them all the tools they need and they all have the capability of doing just fine (I teach ""regular"" kids, which at my school is mostly the lower-level kids who aren't special ed), so now it's just up to them to put in the effort. I'm a little nervous, but mostly excited for them to show what they know. 

Sorry for the wall of text: hopefully you feel comfortable with whatever decision you make!"
highschoolteachers,"I have a scary amount of debt, a BA in history, an MEd, and my teaching certification in social studies. I'm a first year teacher at one of the ""100 Worst Public Schools in America"" (from Newsweek) in a very poor district. 

I love it.

It is the hardest thing I've ever done. It is challenging and frightening and really fucking amazing. I get to be creative every day, I get to explore and learn all sorts of things (this year I'm teaching Cultural Geography which I never even knew was a class and I am creating the curriculum from scratch). I get to talk about important and real issues with my kids - my seniors and I are doing a Race in America unit and it is awesome and uplifting to hear them discuss their thoughts, feelings, political opinions, and visions for the future. I get to joke around with my kids and watch them mature (even in the 6 months I've had my 9th graders they've grown up so much!). I get to teach them how to write and speak and read and understand information about the world around them; how to communicate! I teach my students how to be a person, how to interact with each other, how to participate in our society. I give them books to read and important movies to watch; I write the baby punks and goths song lists on my lunch hour (I was that baby punk in high school); I give advice to girls about jeans and friends and boys; I talk to boys about relationships and football and video games; I teach them about language and how words can hurt you; I photobomb my kids' Snapchats; make them record songs about Geography; put their maps and drawings on the wall and see their faces light up when they see their work up; watch them try on and discard a new personality every week; watch them brag and cry and learn and be angry and wonderful and teenagers. 

I love them and this job so much. And today, I cried in frustration at the end of the day, because my 9th graders didn't care about learning about Israel and Palestine and my lesson plan bombed. I have more than 20 students in various classes that don't speak English - some have never even been to school before! - and I'm struggling a lot learning how to teach them. I get frustrated with meetings and the impossible bureaucracy that means I can't even get notebook paper in my classroom. I'm sad when my kids fail and I cry when I ask what they did over break and they say ""I went to my brother's funeral."" I work a lot - 10 hour days are normal - and usually work on the weekends too. I drink a lot of coffee and I don't make a lot of money. I'm a teacher, parent, counselor, therapist, provider, caretaker, secretary, test proctor - this job is 30 jobs in one. I'm the happiest and saddest I've ever been. I wouldn't trade this job for anything. "
highschoolteachers,"I am a teacher and I absolutely love my job. Before becoming a teacher I worked in an office job where I had great hours, great coworkers, and great pay. But I was never fulfilled--I left all that to become a teacher and this is now my 4th year and I love it!  I teach English Language Learners and AP students at a diverse high school.

Here are the things I love about teaching:  1) I get to be around people all day. I get to see all their moods and opinions and behaviors and analyze them and figure out how to best help each kid. 2) I am never bored. Sometimes I am very stressed out and overwhelmed, but never bored. 3) I get to be creative.  If I want to reuse old lessons I can, but I can always do something new! 4) I get to teach the subject I love!  

A disclaimer though: the first year of teaching can be really rough (mostly because of workload). My second year was also difficult. The third year was a lot easier, and now in my fourth year I finally feel like I know what I am doing and am able to design much better lessons and manage my classroom a lot better. There are also downsides to teaching, of course, but every job has them and for me the negatives are very much trumped by the positives. Find the other positive teachers at your school and stick with them :) "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a history teacher at a small, rural high school in North Carolina. While there are days I want to pull my hair out and scream, there are days that totally make up for it.

For instance, there was today. I was teaching the students about the Bill of Rights and the students started asking me questions about some of the individual amendments. Then we got on the discussion of the death penalty being seen as ""cruel and unusual punishment"" by some people. This led to an unplanned debate where the students explained their positions back and forth and used their critical thinking skills. As I watched, I felt so proud seeing them form their own opinions and explain them thoroughly.

And then after school, I was discussing with a student an upcoming event she's helping me with. She then said that when she graduates, I'll be one of the few teachers she'll come back and visit. That made me super happy.

Now of course, I've had my fair share of difficulties. I don't want you to forget that. But with every challenge you face, there are always those moments that make you love your job more."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school, and I can't believe how well the ""I like the way _______ is listening"" works at that level. Kids will get indignant if they're doing something correctly and I don't acknowledge them. I have to remind them I can only say one name at a time!

I also can't believe the power stickers have for these kids. They will fall over themselves to get a sticker."
highschoolteachers,"There are lots of good ideas here! I moved to middle school from high school and saw some big differences. For example, they have a really hard time sitting still because they're growing so much. Having them move around the room a little when you can. They also can't listen to a lecture for 30-40 minutes. The book ""What Great Middle School Teachers Do Differently"" helped me 

Here are some more easy activities you can incorporate with minimal planning:

--Use a carousel activity to get them to share answers
--Setup stations in the room for them to discuss answers to various questions
--Musical partners. Play a song and let them move. Stop the music and have them find a partner. Give them a task (answer a question, for example). I do this 4 times max. Good for quick review. 
--Have them create tests or quizzes. They can make multiple choice questions with the wrong answers. This takes WAAAAY longer than you might think. It room my kids to about 10 minutes to write one question. Use the questions or don't. Still good review. 
--Fishbowl discussions or debates.
--Socratic seminars or practical debates. Give the kids a current event or Supreme Court Case and have them debate it and try to figure out how the Supreme Court did/will rule. "
highschoolteachers,"I can speak for my state, but 5-8 I teach all types of science.  In high school I am only licensed to teach biology/life science.  Though, the only thing I have to do to get chemistry/physics/earth science is take the corresponding tests.   

I think science would be more fun, but I am biased.  I talk about public policy all the time..."
highschoolteachers,"Science is broken up by subject, so you often have to get certified to teach a specific science, like biology, physics, chemistry, etc...

As for what makes me qualified, I went to college for Physics, but took a lot of classes in Earth Science, and some chemistry and biology. I also spent many years teaching swimming and life-guarding, which really helped when I got into the classroom. Knowledge of a subject is important. But the ability to convey the knowledge doesn't come naturally to most. Think about your college classes, many were probably just professors writing on a chalk board or using PPTs. If you were lucky you had a good recitation where a TA helped you work while you were in groups or something similar. Teaching high school is a lot more like the good recitation than the lecture. You have to combine elements of both. But if you just get up and lecture everyday, you won't last long at all at most public schools. Maybe some private schools."
highschoolteachers,"It depends on your state.  In Kentucky, for example, you don't become certified in high school science.  You have to pick physics, earth science, chemistry, or biology.  It has to be your major."
highschoolteachers,"I feel you on the ""every single day can't be amazing"" thing, but here's a couple ideas for you. I teach Spanish in high school.

1. When possible, recycle good activities that you've already done. Vocab games for chapter 1 can be adapted to chapter 2 with minimal work for you. It's more bang for your buck, and in my experience, the kids like it because they already know the rules and expectations for the activity. For example, when teaching new verb tenses, my classes will play ""Uno"" using cards with different verb forms. I have 3-4 different ""Uno"" games that we will play throughout the year as we learn new tenses. Making a new version is easy once you have a template.

2. Get ideas from [TeachersPayTeachers](http://www.teacherspayteachers.com). Sometimes I buy an activity, sometimes I'll borrow the idea but make the materials myself, but usually I'll look at the free activities and download or adapt those.

3. Maybe this is unsustainable for middle school, but one good speaking activity I do is ""Find somebody who...""  I use it as an icebreaker at the beginning of the year, I then recycle it throughout the year (see #1). Make a worksheet with 5-10 descriptions on it and have them ask their classmates the questions until they find someone who fits/says yes. For example, if it's a family chapter, questions would be ""Find somebody who has more than 3 siblings,"" ""Find somebody whose grandparents live nearby,"" ""Find somebody who doesn't have any siblings,"" etc. Students would circulate and ask each other, ""Tom, do you have more than 3 siblings?"" Tom says no, so the student asks Jerry. Jerry says ""Yes, I have 4,"" so the student writes ""Jerry has 4 siblings"" for that item and moves along to the next one. I have them write down their answers to prove that they did it, but the emphasis is on the speaking exchange. Monitor them with a clipboard and take off points for speaking English or just pointing and nodding at questions instead of speaking and make that a participation grade. My students really like this activity because they get to go talk to different people, and it's unstructured but goal oriented. I like it because it's versatile, you can use it for any vocab theme or verb tense, and it lets them talk to each other instead of listening to me."
highschoolteachers,"I have about two students who ask me this every single day.  That or, ""Can we take a nap today?""  Whaaa?  This is high school choir, an *elective* that they *went out of their way to sign up for*.  

I don't really have any ideas for consequences.  I usually just ask them what they think we are going to do today (we are going to sing because this is choir duh)."
highschoolteachers,"Hey, I want to push back for a minute here.  I taught high school math (have moved on since then) in a low SES school.  I can honestly say that some of our best discussions as a class came when we began discussing social issues and public policy.  I spent a lot of time finding ways to include those pieces into my curriculum and my kids responded.  I taught the full spectrum of students - from ""Senior Math Topics"" (aka seniors doing 8th grade math) to Honors Pre-Calculus - and it worked well in each.

One really great resource that I found for helping me with this was http://www.radicalmath.org/.  Definitely check it out at some point if you're interested."
highschoolteachers,"I agree with other posts saying that the type of discussion you're looking for may not actually be too common at the high school level. While there's supposed to be *some* time devoted to discussion of that kind of thing in high school science classes, I don't think it always plays out like that, due to controversy/political &amp; parental pressure/time constraints/kids not all being at the same level of understanding or caring to have a discussion like that. That doesn't mean that it straight-up doesn't exist - there are definitely alternative schools out there that are *focused* on providing that kind of discussion in their classes. Private schools are probably a better bet."
highschoolteachers,"Fellow math major here, currently in grad school. I just wanted to respond to your point about knowing everything about math. This is pretty much true if by everything you mean everything a high school student would think of asking about, but is far from true in general. There are tons of people researching new math all the time. I don't know what your undergrad program included, but I'm sure if you ask one of your professors, they'd give you some examples of different problems that are being researched in the areas included in your program. "
highschoolteachers,"I think every teacher likely proved high school level competency when they received high school diplomas. If you think that such competency is too narrow, then you have a problem with high school curriculum, not teachers.

The problem is it's hard to shoot for having excellent teachers when they are paid very little, expected to work miracles, and treated like shit.

You know how many of the teachers I had in high school that really pushed the boundaries and challenged us as students are still working as teachers now, 3-6 years later? Very few. I can think of maybe one of five or six in total. Most left the field of education to work elsewhere, or go back to school, or what have you. It's hard to justify putting your self on the line and going the extra mile for $30k a year, especially when housing eats up $15k of that a year, food another thousand or two, transportation another thousand (assuming you don't have major car trouble), not to mention paying for supplies to do your job, child care if you have kid(s), medical expenses, etc. Good luck fixing our fucked up education system by making it harder for people to get into the profession. Keep fucking with kid's futures by spending more on fucking jails then our school teachers and infrastructure. At least we will have a place to put them once they flunk out."
highschoolteachers,"I'd take that a step further and say if you're teaching a subject, you need to be able to do everything that the students are expected to do, and be competent in the ""next step"" -- for instance, that means if you are teaching elementary school math, you should be able to do well in algebra. If you are teaching high school math, you should be able to do differential equations and some discrete/proofs. Having the bare minimum of knowledge is not enough to be able to prepare students for the next step if you yourself can't do the next step and can't anticipate what they will need to understand, the skills they will need to develop, etc."
highschoolteachers,"So you don't count participation in their overall grade at all? I agree with you and think that IDEALLY this is how high school should be run but the maturity level of my students would not fare well in this scenario. I even have problems with these 3 simple rules in my AP class. Not to go on a tirade but I do think that students in this generation are spoiled and used to having things handed to them- whether it be a grade, notes, or an answer. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. I don't give participation points, but I do tell my students that:

A. If you have questions you are not asking, I assume you understand everything.

B. If you are choosing not to work during work time they are choosing not to receive help on their assignments.

C. If you miss information because you weren't paying attention I will not repeat it for you.

Basically, participation is not a bonus - it's the expectation. I don't need to attach points to it - you get points for learning the material and in order to do that you need to participate. If you are a master of Geometry and you don't need help from me at all to completely develop your understanding, then sure feel free to read a book. But if I see you reading a book then there is absolutely no chance that I am going to answer your questions about the material later. For as long as there are questions and meaningful discussion taking place in my room, I will happily continue offering answers, advice, and discussion, but I never work harder than my students are working because that doesn't teach them anything."
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school choir, so daily participation is a huge part of their grade.  My kids can earn 5 points every day, and I take off points for being late to class, coming to class unprepared, misbehaving, things like that.  

I know a choir director who gives 5 points each week, so the students only get 1 point per day.  So in that case it's either all or nothing each day.  If they're unprepared or a distraction in class, they just get a zero for the day.  I'm thinking about doing something more like this system next year, but right now I'm okay with my current system because I don't have as many students right now. "
highschoolteachers,"I said none of the words that you put in my mouth at all. High school teachers should be able to show the minimum **high-school student** competency. Elementary teachers should be able to do everything elementary students are expected to do. This says nothing about the teachers' qualifications for teaching or ability to teach, especially in the HS subjects they teach. It's just basic fundamental competency. ES/MS/HS teachers should be able to perform at the level expected for the students they teach, then have SME knowledge in specific subjects if at the 7-12 level.

Math teachers should be able to write, read critically, and understand social events. English teachers should know how to do basic math. These are the same things we require of students graduating from high school. HS teachers should at least be on general HS level. If they aren't ... well, we get what we deserve."
highschoolteachers,"A friend of mine used a tally system on a laminated seating chart.  She had one on a clip board for each class (high school history).  She would give a student a mark for being in his/her seat on time with the materials and a marks at the end of the period for having the area clean before leaving.  She would then randomly give 3 marks during the period to any students working.  It was a quick system and the kids responded well to it.  EDIT: She used a dry erase marker and counted points at the end of each day or when it was convenient (sometimes the end of the week).  She would erase the marks after putting the points into her grade book.  

I work in MS, and I used the Organized Binder system.  They have this Weekly Lifeline page which is a warm up that allows me to get the kids focused on the lesson AND give participation points.  They get a question and give a response (on their log) within the first two minutes of class.  At the end of class, they have to write a reflection on something they learned.  On Fridays, I collect their logs as their ""ticket out.""  They're worth 10 points a week, but 2 points a day.  

In my drama class, I grade participation on a random thing each day (usually having their script and/or writing in their journal).  It's 5 points a day.  Since it is a participatory and elective class, it ends up being worth 50% of their grade.  "
highschoolteachers,"I've always thought there's almost no security in our high school.  I see strangers around all the time, unidentified. Sure enough one day last year some guy freely went around saying he was a inspector.  No one ever verified it. Turned out he had been doing this at schools all over town.  Suddenly we started requiring visitors to get passes to wear from the office. Lasted about a week before things went back to the typical lack of security.  Everything's fine until something bad happens and then everyone asks why wasn't anything done to prevent this crisis/tragedy from happening.
"
highschoolteachers,"I think that's too long of a time period. Monday to Friday gives enough time to schedule but not enough to really forget. I also have it written on a huge board at the front of my room so they are reminded daily and I ask for it daily if anyone has is completed. That way, if they did i t, they can turn it in early and not lose the papers. 

I also used to assign homework daily and then do a homework quiz weekly when I taught high school. Don't give the problem just give the page number and problem number. That way they need to have both written on their homework to get a good score. That might motivate them after a few zeros."
highschoolteachers,"I went to a pretty rough high school in my childhood. We had an on campus police officer, and I imagine that in that situation a student would have been sent to get him/her. 

I also did my first practical placement in a school with a policy of openly wearing a blue card (police clearance to work with children), and we were photographed, then given a pass with the photo and date on it each time we entered the school. 

That school also had a police officer, so I imagine the procedure would have been the same if someone had entered without following procedure."
highschoolteachers,"For high school, in each unit I provided a list of questions with page numbers corresponding to each day of the unit. The answers for all textbook questions are at the back of the textbook. These are recommended practice matching concepts covered in class. 

I gave in-class open book assignments (formative or summatively marked), quizzes &amp; mini quizzes (10 min max @ start of class or end of lesson to check for understanding, and unit exams. 

The current research supports the idea that assigned homework for grades is not meaningful assessment. Students don't do it, time wasted tracking and nagging, some students honestly don't need to do the extra practice to learn the concepts to an excellent level, we all know some copy answers from each other, the back of the book etc. 

I have students sign an agreement at the beginning of the course. This includes their responsibility to complete practice questions at home and to study for all assessments, to arrange with 1 or 2 other students to get the notes or handouts if they are sick or absent and participate during class to take notes, engage in activities, answer questions and compete practice when time of provided. 

My mini quizzes were often the exact same questions or a couple of the questions out of the textbook. So it was easy to tell to at least tried the questions. I would ask at the start of class if there were any questions on the recommended list that anyone had a problem with - usually no one did because the kids who cared did the questions, checked their answers and figured out what they did wrong OR didn't bother to even try the practice. If I had time I would use a check list to keep track of who would bring up questions for clarification so I could comment that it was evident they were taking responsibility for their learning. I also knew which were the most challenging and started the lesson off reviewing one or two from the list when no one brought up specific questions. 

Every student needs to practice each concept to varying degrees. If not doing homework is earning you the grade you want (parents want) the don't do homework. Tests, quizzes etc are not optional. If you want to improve your understanding &amp; increase your grade it was their job to do the logical step and increase their effort and amt of practice. 

In the end it took WAYS less time marking a 1-3 question mini quiz outside of class, especially to indicate acceptable/adequate understanding, proficient or excellent understanding and developing understanding than checking and following up on homework. While students did mini quiz I was able to take attendance, get things organized. Students knew to automatically come in pick up a mini quiz and start in on it. Way quieter start to class and student spends more time doing math rather than me showing the answers and them just watching. 

"
highschoolteachers,"I student taught, took one class, worked 35 hours a week and coached high school volleyball from Sept. to mid-Nov.  Every minute was scheduled, there was no downtime and I missed out on a vacation, a few family gatherings etc. . Thanksgiving saved me. . ."
highschoolteachers,"Not popular in high school, probably not popular as a teacher.  I'm okay with that.  I maintain professional working relationships as it ought to be."
highschoolteachers,"I personally disagree with that. In order to graduate from high school in my state, passing Mathematics (A, B, or C) and English was actually required. 

In addition, my Education degree required the pass in English, accompanied by an OP of 10 (1 being the highest, 25 being the lowest) to satisfy the entry requirements. "
highschoolteachers,"One of my English teachers did this in high school. One time she had a student reach into a can of corn to dig out the objective on a laminated piece of paper. Had absolutely nothing to do with the lesson, but you can bet every kid in the room was paying attention to it"
highschoolteachers,"Depends where you live. I'm in NY where being a teaching artist is fairly common. I have friends who regularly book broadway work who also run high school and middle school programs (and sub out of those programs when needed). Those who can realize that there's not enough to do so they teach anyway. 

In NYC a lot of schools outsource their arts programs, which makes this kind of thing easier. Rather than having full-time staffers they bring in an outside company to do productions and a class here or there. It means more flexibility for the teachers and the school usually has it easier.

You may want to look into such teaching artist programs, either as a way of transitioning into the field or as a way of teaching while still having the flexibility to do your work. "
highschoolteachers,"I'm a first year teacher in New Jersey with my MAT - I teach English at a public high school in an urban district. My starting salary is $57,260. "
highschoolteachers,"Yes, I am American. I didn't learn any Japanese before I moved here, I'm now super beginner (I know a few words and phrases, can read the first alphabet). Let's see, I worked at a Junior High School, if you get a job (they call it ALT usually) at a JHS or SH you don't need to speak Japanese. Your work is ""part-time"" if you work at a public high-school, but may be full-time if you get a job at a private school (you probably have to speak Japanese or have more experience to get a job like that). I say ""part-time"" because it was really more like full-time. I was supposed to be at work at 8:30, I usually arrived around 8:10 because that's just when my local train was timed for. Usually in Japan a 1 hour commute is considered normal, from what I've heard, though if you're single you might have more freedom to move to a place closer to your job. My usual day after I got to work was 4 classes, lunch, then 2 classes. At Junior and Senior high schools there's 3 grades each, and ALTs work with all the students. So I might have a 1st grade class (U.S. 7th grade - 12 year olds) then a 3rd grade class (U.S. 9th grade - 14 year olds), then 2 2nd grade classes (U.S. 8th grade - 13 year olds). After the first 4 classes there was a lunch period and I at the school lunch. All the teachers and students ate the same school lunch and all the students in the prefecture (in all of Japan?!) eat the same thing. It was usually a bowl of rice, some kind of soup, what they called a salad (it was usually some kind of pickled vegetables, never a salad made with lettuce) and a meat. So after lunch there's usually 2 more classes, then after school clubs and activities. For me, class usually ended at 2:30 some days and 3:30 other days, but I wasn't allowed to leave until after 4:30. So after you're done with classes you have basically an hour of free time. I would visit various sports or clubs (I often played with the table-tennis team) or just read at my desk. Sometimes the English teacher(s) would ask me to grade something. It was really easy, like to read the english ""essays"" (around a paragraph long) and correct any spelling or grammar mistakes, or grade the test (just make sure the correct answer or letter is marked, or check the spelling on vocab tests). In the class work I'd say it was also pretty easy, the main job for us is supposed to be making sure of proper pronunciation. There is a ""primary"" English teacher who is usually Japanese and can speak both Japanese and English, but the Japanese government about 20 years ago made a requirement that a native, or native-level, English speaker is present in any English classes. So there's a lot of jobs available for native speakers, we're there to make sure the students and teacher are pronouncing words properly, answer any questions they have about when to use certain words, etc. I rarely actually planned a lesson, and we don't really ""plan"" and entire lesson because there's already an English textbook each school uses, so you just have the students go along from that. 


The school year starts in April and they usually have ALTs start in May (at least at my school) then there is a 6 week summer break in the last 2 weeks of July and all of August. I work about 15 days a month and I think that's normal for this position at a public school. I got paid a bit less than $2000 U.S. per month. I took the train and my daily far cost around $15. You can drive to work here too, but most of the roads are toll roads so you have to pay either way. Usually the last month you'd work is January/February because there is a lot of testing in the end of the year (March) and they don't want to pay you if they're not having classes most days. I'm not sure what else to add, I could go into more detail but this is already kind of long already. Most of the positions I've seen aren't looking for someone who is necessarily a teacher, just a native english speaker. Oh and I took pictures of my school lunch everyday, so I could put them on imgur if you're interested. Let me know if you have more questions, not sure if I answered everything you were curious about. Are you a native english speaker too? Are you interested in teaching in Japan? I've heard [the JET program](http://www.us.emb-japan.go.jp/JET/) is a good 1 year program to come here and teach.

ETA: I live in the Tokyo Area, teach in Saitama, which is directly north to Tokyo ""prefecture"""
highschoolteachers,"In my experience, high school can become an opportunity for teachers who were not popular as teenagers in high school, to try become popular as adults in high school. You can tell who these teachers are because they surround themselves with students (in a nonsexual, but pathetic way). You can have long-lasting relationships with students without hanging out with them, letting them drive your car, etc. You can simply be a mentor!"
highschoolteachers,"I have certainly met some gossipy teachers in my life, but having worked in other fields, I do not find this exclusive to teaching. Hell, these days, at my very much ""in the trenches"" Title 1 school, I see WAY more camaraderie and FAR less bullshit gossip than I ever saw at any job in the corporate wold. 

Honestly, I don't people change nearly as much after high school as some folks think, in any field. I don't think teachers are particularly stunted. We may be more in touch with kiddie/teen pop culture and slang than other professions, just because we're around it, but other than that, I am not seeing it. I think anyone who thinks cliquishness is reserved for HS or teachers simply hasn't experienced other workplaces. "
highschoolteachers,"Subbing is glorified babysitting. If no one died or lost a limb, then you were successful. Doesn't mean it was a good day....but when you're just starting and don't know the kids and the school very well yet, it won't be great. 

My first time subbing at the middle school I eventually got hired on at, I lasted 10 minutes into an option class before one kid asked me who shit in my cornflakes. I subbed at a high school for a resource teacher and had one kid straight up walk out on me 15 minutes into class, after refusing to tell me his name or do anything I asked. 

It is what it is. As long as no one got hurt, maimed or otherwise damaged...put it in the win column and help yourself to some vodka. Kids aren't great to subs they don't know, so you may not enjoy each assignment, but once you get more established in your area, it will get better. 

And like others have said...gym class in the hallway = set up to fail. You couldn't have done better than you did. "
highschoolteachers,"&gt; From what I see, all elementary school teachers use aggressive tactics to keep their kids in line, yelling at them all the time, on and on. I don't blame them, it keeps them in line, but it's not for me.

Uh...HS may be more your thing, but I have very rarely seen an elementary teacher raise his/her voice and I almost never did in elementary teaching. Now, in middle school... and even high school (less in 11th/12th)... yeah. Even then, it's never been a cornerstone of my discipline though. Maybe if I were a gym teacher (yelling seems more ""acceptable"" in that general scene, really). Just sayin'

As others have said, subbing in a gym class that couldn't even be held in a gym with little support...eh, not your fault. Hopefully you won't lose your job for one bad day either. Maybe lose your ability to go back to THAT particular school but most temp agencies will give you one, as a sub, since subs are often hard to find anyway. "
highschoolteachers,"What do you mean school teachers are ""big kids""? Do you mean that they are goofy and playful? Guess what--ask around and I bet you'll find plenty of adults across all professions that have all of those traits and wouldn't hesitate to refer to themselves as ""big kids."" What's more, plenty of adults across all professions will tell you that other adults are petty and clique-ish. 
The way you and your friend were trash talking school teachers just goes to show the pervasive disrespect towards those in our profession, and what's worse, you guys are teachers. Sure, I like to have a good time and can be goofy and playful, but I am a highly-educated professional- not just some fool stuck trying to relive my high school years.

highschoolteachers,"Subbing elementary gym and teaching high school ESL are two completely different tasks in the field of education. Do not be worried. I teach high school English, and while subbing I had a rough day as an elementary school French teacher. Guess what? I don't teach elementary French. Problem solved."
highschoolteachers,"This is my former high school, and I TA'd for this teacher in my senior year. They were a major influence in my decision to pursue education as a career.
I truly hope that the teacher in question has found peace. They will be greatly missed. "
highschoolteachers,"Subbing is not like real teaching. /u/tree_bandit said it best. You got dealt a pretty shitty hand today. If the temp agency you work for has an issue with it, go somewhere else. If you really like working with high school kids, then apply directly to a high school. 

I worked as a long term sub about 5 years ago. It wasn't so bad. But, at the time, I had 7 years of experience and I was going to be in that class full time for the rest of the year. The kids didn't like me at first. They missed their old teacher. But, they finally came around. That's the best kind of subbing-long term. But, I imagine day-to-day has got to suck. Hell, I hate covering my co-workers' classes and they're full of kids I've taught before.

Don't let today get you down. Tomorrow is another day. You can do this. Just don't sub for an elementary gym class being held in a hallway again."
highschoolteachers,"I dunno about your experience, but in my high school there was plenty of male teacher flirting with the female students. You saw it all the time."
highschoolteachers,"I subbed for a high school gym class and got a formal reprimand for leaving kids unattended in the hallway where they broke a light.

The kicker is, the other gym teacher had allowed them to go with him to play soccer, but decided it was more convenient to blame me when shit hit the fan.  

Subbing blows.  It's not indicative of your success as a teacher.  Sub in another district if you can't sub there again."
highschoolteachers,"This has not been my experience at all, with one exception. I had a co-worker who seemed to be trying to relive her high school years. She had been asked to resign from a previous job due to being too friendly with her students. She only lasted 1 year here."
highschoolteachers,"Subbing really is nothing like teaching. I only subbed a couple times. I hated it and I stopped. I went on to be a teacher, and I love it. Elementary discipline is very different from high school. I've done both. I rarely raise my voice (ignoring the fact that I have a naturally loud voice). No one says you have to do something related to teaching as you work through school. For a while, I worked in a bowling alley. Gave me an income. Never put it on a resume. If you don't want to sub, don't."
highschoolteachers,"&gt; How many snow days have you had this year?

Including today, I've had 4 along with a slew of 2 hour delays.
&gt; What does it take to have a snow day?

Well we had a day with snow earlier this year and didn't close.  Parents complained and now they seem to call a snow day for rain or just cold weather.  Usually it's about an inch or more of snow that sticks to sidewalks and roads.
&gt; Do you find out the morning of our night before?

Sometimes the night before, usually the morning of.  A lot of times they'll issue the delay the night before and then cancel the next morning.
&gt; How do you make up snow days? 

They first take them from Spring Break.  If there's more, they'll add them to the end of the school year.

I'm in Maryland and I also have a snow day today.  I teach high school and we have an A day/B day schedule.  The A/B day schedule is set in stone at the beginning of the year.  The last two snow days have been A days, meaning my A day has just flat out missed two classes now.  I have to figure out some way to get them caught up to my B day class or slow my B day class down.  Slowing down isn't really an option since the day of the AP test won't change.  I don't know what the reason for setting the A/B day schedule up and not allowing it to change.  It would make a lot more sense to bump it back for a missed day.  If there's a snow day on an A day, the next school day is now an A day instead of having two B days in a row."
highschoolteachers,"Hey! I am in Austin. There are a lot of ISDs in the area. Trying to live close to your school will save you so much time! I teach high school, so I don't know if I can help you too much, but speaking Spanish will really open up some schools for you. A lot of the elementary schools  do dual language education, where they switch off days between English and Spanish. 

A really great preschool I used to work at during the summers is called Emerson Academy in round rock. "
highschoolteachers,"I have very mixed opinions. I think Lockhart has the wrong idea about math and music. I teach math and am a part-time musician, and in both cases I learned the language first. I learned to read music and I learned basic math. The only problem I had with either was the speed at which the classes progressed; I was interested in both and many of my classmates were not.

But suppose you had a different upbringing. Suppose your elementary class spends an hour a week playing with xylophones doing whatever the students want. That sounds awesome! What happens if none of them ever learn to read music or play another instrument? Nothing. Now, what if every kid comes to middle school or high school and can't add and subtract because they spent a lot of time discussing how to draw lines through rectangles? That's a problem. If you don't want to be a musician, you'll be fine not knowing much about music. If you don't want to be a mathematician, you still need to be able use numbers.

It should be clear that Lockhart doesn't expect us teachers to STOP teaching specific skills, but rather to incorporate explorations into the classroom. We should encourage students to think critically while also teaching them some basic skills. Now, which of you a**holes don't already try your best to do that?

I try my best to give students questions that encourage them to think about something even if they can't solve it. Most of the time those come back blank because the students don't want to do that kind of work. Lockhart's ideas are great for those students that may learn to love math and devote their lives to it, but we aren't only trying to educate mathematicians. Most of my best students will become engineers and they will be pissed if they have to take algebra in college because I spent all of their time trying to convince them to be a mathematician.

Just like many musicians, my students want to get to college with the basic skills they need to succeed. Most of those skills will not be memorized formulae, but some will be. Sometimes they will experiment and sometimes I will just tell them how to do something. I let them experiment to guess what the power rule is, but I don't make them try to figure out the best way to define a limit. That took humanity about 100 years.

Finally (wow! you made it this far, thanks), I think Lockhart has built a strawman with his ""standard school mathematics curriculum"". Sure we had to memorize multiplications tables, but we also experimented with blocks to find volumes of cubes. Also 
&gt;Students are taught to view mathematics as a set of procedures, akin to religious rites, which are eternal and set in stone

come on. He has some very good ideas, but he writes in black and white (of course literally, but I mean that figuratively too). I would prefer it if he wrote a book with some of his classroom activities that he uses instead of just complaining that everyone else does a bad job.

Overall I support him and some of his thoughts, but I don't think everything is as bad as he makes it out to be, and I don't think doing things his way would necessarily fix things. What about my class of students that may not pass state exams and it takes all of my energy to stop them from hitting each other. I try so hard to get them to do things like come up with the formula for a triangle's area. On a good day, they will stare at me quietly and do nothing. (I should note that I teach an AP class and two remedial classes, so I have very different experiences)"
highschoolteachers,"Cinema is a subject I currently teach in a high school. Here are some of the resources I've collected.

**[iStopMotion for iPad](http://boinx.com/istopmotion/ipad/)** 
In your post, you mention the kids made clay sculptures. These would be great to use with iStopMotion if you have iPads. I've used this with younger students, I think with some help from an adult even three year olds could use it.

**[GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine](http://www.goldieblox.com/products/goldieblox_and_the_movie_machine)** 
Although this is designed as a toy marketed to young girls, I'll be using it with my grade ten students this year. This is a great way for students to get an idea of how motion pictures work, by creating their own animations made up of twelve drawings. I'll be introducing the project with this video by Walt Disney on [The Story of the Animated Drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnQSLxJmMg).

**[Journeys in Film](http://journeysinfilm.org/films/)** 
These resources connect feature-length, English- and foreign-language narrative and documentary films to subjects like English, History, and Science. The activities included engage students in active learning in a variety of ways, from discussions to hands on activities.

**[Teachers Guide Series](http://www.oscars.org/educational-programs/teachers-guide-series) by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences** 
This series of teachers guides explore the art and science of motion pictures. The guides include activities designed to capitalize on students' natural interest in current films to develop visual literacy skills. Topics include Animation, Documentaries, Film Editing, Visual Effects, Sound and Music, and many others. Each teaching guide is available in its entirety to download and print for free. 

If I have time tomorrow after school, I'll post some more links here."
highschoolteachers,"Yes, apologies! I would 100% recommend against teaching in FL if you want to work in an environment that is flexible, funded, or equitable towards its staff and students. I taught in three counties in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area middle and high school English. My experiences again and again in the public school system was that school staffs were largely negative, under trained, and general non-supportive. The federal government was also unforgiving being Republican run. Rick Scott cut over one billion dollars in his first year as Governor. Then there was inside the schools. I was raised in a Lutheran private school and found myself daydreaming through my education. There was no differentiation in instruction for various learning styles. It was very one size fits all. I found the same thing working extensively in the public high schools. The state-written curriculum was all worksheets that taught to the test, and severely underestimated its student audience with material that was irrelevant and dull. There was also a disregard for diversity. I found the curriculum provided did not reflect diversity in the novels chosen or the writings prompts presented and in general there was a conservative tilt among the faculties. 

Seattle is a whole other world. For one, the students are extremely intelligent and aware of themselves. This is largely because Seattle is an educated population. The city has a burgeoning economy because of its tech industry that draws lots of liberal wealth to the city. In my experience the students have a lot of equanimity for their peers (religion, race, orientation), are aware of local politics, involved in their communities, and in general are well read. Right now I'm working in the independent school system in Seattle. Now to preface this, it costs $20 grand a year to send your kids to one of these schools (K-12). That being said, these schools are literally dream schools. The staff is passionate and in love with their job. Professional development is highly encouraged and paid for. The students are humble and eager to learn (not to mention ridiculously well-behaved). The curriculum is flexible and always adapting. Technology is largely integrated in the classroom. From what I've witnessed, the public schools here are also leagues above what I worked with in FL. Seattle is a healthy, quickly growing city. 

Outside of Seattle and Tacoma most of WA is small mountain town... I can't speak for those schools. Teaching in Seattle has been surreal, easily any teacher's dream. I'm working in schools where people love what they do, where kids love coming to school, and where tests aren't taught to. In History the other day I was teaching my fourth graders about America's Japanese internment camps during WWII. I was like ""Dang, in FL everything was so 'ra-ra-America' I didn't even know we had internment camps!"" 
"
highschoolteachers,"What makes me frustrated is that this kind of stuff still trips *me* up, let alone young students. I had to learn for my self what calculus really was, and what the point of it was. Nothing in high school or college ever bothered to explain it to me. Also, I recently went back to school for a grad degree in applied math with 10 years since college calculus, which was going to be an uphill battle to begin with, but I was incredibly frustrated by the terminology and formalism.

Take the mean value theorem, for example. To me, it's just about the simplest, most intuitive idea in the world. I could explain it to a child: ""Draw a straight line, realize you can't draw another line connecting two points on that line without matching the 'steepness' of the original line at some point on your way,"" and you're most of the way there. But I read the whole page in our Advanced Calculus book not knowing WTF it was talking about until I finally realized it was just a hackneyed way of explaining the mean value theorem. "
highschoolteachers,"I was just talking with this about some of my colleagues. I graduated from high school in Michigan and looking back on it, having the MME is a lot different than how they do it in Pennsylvania and Virginia and probably many other states. I do like the fact that students here don't have to remember things for years, but at least it was a lot less testing comparatively. "
highschoolteachers,"I currently work in a school (high school ELA teacher here) that went from being one of the most positive environments I've ever been able to work in, to a toxic, back-stabbing zero-tolerance bullshit zone in a matter of 6 months (new superintendent and principal). This new environment has been bubbling since day 1 this year and just this past week hit a new low. 

There have been a slew of new hires, so that too has contributed to the new culture of the school as well. The jovial nature of the building where everyone seemed to get along well, has been substituted with back-stabbing, uber sensitive, and extreme political correctness. We now have a culture of tattle-taling.

The worst part about everything is that the newly hired principal (a teacher who made the jump to admin) came across as the best possible hire, that would understand the plight of being an educator, has done a 180 and seems to have forgotten in 6 months. 

It really sucks! I thought I would be in this school for the long haul and now I'm looking at new schools for next year, or simply get out of education altogether, since this is a reality in many places, at least the districts/schools in my area. We had the best reputation, it was the type of place teachers came to work until retirement, very little turnover. I considered myself so lucky.

I love the students, I coach as well, and even so I feel like I need to get out ASAP. I feel like I'm run by idiots who just happen to have the certification necessary to get admin jobs. 
"
highschoolteachers,"We have AVID at our school, and I'm getting a class of it next year. AVID is a curriculum that, as Rabbit said, is oriented to students who will be the first in their family to go to college. It is not de facto honors, though they push for the students to take honors courses, but there is a big focus on organization, WICOR strategies, note-taking, and the like. It is also a kind of familial atmosphere, since that group of students will, by and large, stay together in that class for all 4 years of high school. What you will see, even if you don't teach an AVID course, is that they will have binders they have to keep up with and Cornell style is mandated in notes. It's a solid program, in my experience, and I enjoy it when I have AVID kids in my classes. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach in a standards-based district. I was hesitant at first, but now I love it. Here's my setup:

- I give some homework/practice (high school math). Students get a stamp/sticker on a chart if they have the work complete. 

- Maybe 1 homework every two weeks I will collect for an assessment grade, and I collect it the day after we go over it in class so students have a chance to ask questions/make corrections.

- We do traditional quizzes/tests. The school also has a policy that students can retake any assessment to show growth. In my class, in order to do a retake, they must have all those homework stamps filled in before they can do a retake. 

- If they do a retake, suck, and want to try AGAIN, then they have to do some extra work to show that they have progressed; they can't just try and try and try. 

Pros: overall less grading. It allows (somewhat) for students to work at their own comfort level and self-regulate because they can choose not to do homework if they feel like they understand it. Their grade reflects their current level of understanding - an early F doesn't have to haunt you all year.

Cons: Students don't do homework/practice when they need to, and there's little I can do to motivate them. The attitude that ""I'll just retake it"" is prevalent. It doesn't really prepare them for life after high school because there are not hard deadlines and consequences for not meeting them. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade in a K-8 school which has an unwritten no-homework policy.  We can technically give homework, but it isn't supposed to be used in grading (we are a standards based school).  In my opinion it creates an atmosphere of ambivalence and apathy in our students outside of the 15% who are highly motivated.  I can't imagine what it would do in high school.

Interestingly enough, 95% of the questions I get from parents revolve around the fact that they have no homework."
highschoolteachers,"I give my fair share of homework, but I have been leaning towards a no homework policy lately. 

I really feel sorry for some of the students that spend their whole night doing homework. They are still kids and need time to play. I also feel for their parents. They might want to go out to eat, see a movie, or just hang out with the person they love most before they move away forever after high school.

The problem I am seeing at my school is every subject, giving 30 minutes homework every night. That's a total of four hours at my school that finishes at 4:30."
highschoolteachers,"We're testing in our high school English II and Geometry, because next year we'll be testing the same students in English III and Algebra II (my principal wanted rollover data). I'm the Geometry teacher and was finally sent a link to the practice test yesterday. Gave it a shot after school on my own and HOLY CRAP that was hard! I was using a lot of knowledge that I know my kids don't have to answer the questions, and our sophomores are notorious for being extremely lazy, so this is really going to be an interesting two years for testing data!"
highschoolteachers,"Yep, if the kids don't already know it by the time they get to high school, we may as well give up, eh? "
highschoolteachers,"Let me give you my experience as a gifted kid. I was always top of the class since pre-k, but the teachers never mentioned the possibility to skip a grade.

In grade 6, the first year of junior high here, the teachers realized how bored I was and the next school year I was bumped to grade 8.

It was hell.

I had no problem with the curriculum - still top of the class with a little more challenge.

But I was a pariah. There was a petition from the students to stop me from skipping grade 7. The older pupils hated that the youngest kid was better than them and I was bullied for 2 years until I moved to high school. You know how vicious 13 year-olds can be.

I so wish I had been bumped forward in primary school. There just isn't bullying of that kind amongst 6-year-olds. I'm sure they wouldn't have realised what happened

You don't have to have your kid bumped at all, of course. But if it happens, it'll be easier on her the sooner it happens."
highschoolteachers,"Why did you become a teacher?

I've wanted to be a teacher since I was five years old. My ""playroom"" as a child was actually designed to be a classroom. Oddly enough, a boy in my ""class"" with the same exact name as my brother kept getting detentions. Ironic, eh?

Ultimately when I decided this was the path for me (about 4 years after high school), I knew it was the right path because I wanted to work a job where my energy was spent genuinely influencing other people. 

What have been the high points of being a teacher?

I started my career working in a title 1 school, which is where I've been for the past 3 years. These kids need teachers who care. When students come to me just to talk about their lives, I know I matter to them. I'm someone they can count on when they can't count on others. That's more important to me than teaching them pre-algebra. Although, I will say, when a kid has been struggling with a concept and he or she finally gets it. That's cool, too. But, teaching is so much more than academics.

...The low points?

For the same reasons as my high points, my low points exist. Teaching public urban education means some kids and families legitimately do not care. What so ever. I had a parent tell an administrator before, ""Do whatever you want at school, I don't care. Don't call me."" When you see how little education is valued in so many lives, it can surely take a toll on you. 

What advice would you give to new teachers?
Don't take anything personally. Kids do and say the weirdest stuff. It has nothing, usually, to do with you.

What should new teachers focus on most?
The first year is all about survival. The second year, you'll work really hard because you'll realize all the stuff you should have done. You'll start to make a difference your third year. Basically, keep going. It gets better. Focus on getting through the day. Constantly reflect. Ask yourself what went well and what didn't. Adjust accordingly. 

What is your teaching philosophy?
I personally subscribe to a philosophy of Arete. There's always something at which you can be better. Keep going. I try to instill that in my students. Everyone can be successful, but there's a balance between home, school, and student. All students are capable with the correct supports and determination.
"
highschoolteachers,"I was a college drop-out who became a teacher by accident - a series  of events that took me from theater to museum presentation to an MAT in teaching with technology to a media specialist to an ITS gig to a full-time classroom teacher.   Never planned to be a teacher in any way.  SO blessed.  

High points are numerous, but include working my way towards full-time teaching of my own curriculum (media literacy and communications theory), teacher leadership and governance at local and state level - I really am good at teaching teaching itself - and 22 years of student successes from every type of kid, from driven prep school geniuses to about-to-drop-out inner city ninth graders.    Senior class advisorship was an amazing ride.  Living with my students in the apartment of a prep school dorm was a true joy, and everyone should try it for at least a year.  

Low points have been numerous, too.  Last year was one of the worst years of my life due to an inept but cruel evaluator and a lack of support but plenty of blame for a class from hell.   

Advice for new teachers could fill a book, and does.  But the biggest thing to focus on for newbies these days, I think, is developing a habit of deliberate backwards design at all levels - it will be evident in clear objectives and methods, so serve evaluation criteria, and is so satisfying when it works.   Also: never be afraid to try a strategy for classroom management; you'll learn as you go along, but always try strategies with full and deliberate commitment, or suffer the consequences.  

My teaching philosophy: 

1. It's the minds that matter, not the material.  When people ask you what you teach, think ""I teach students.""

2. Teaching students to embrace and welcome the discomfort of not understanding something at first is the prerequisite for all learning.  Teach it first, and reteach it often. 

3. If it isn't fun for you, it isn't fun for the students.  And if we're not having fun, we're doing it wrong.  

4.  Sing all day.  Out loud.  I greet my inner city high school kids with ""It's a beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" most days.   

5.  Always keep your door open.   Build it; they will come.  "
highschoolteachers,"Why did you become a teacher?
I graduated high school and began college in the mid/late 90s. I wanted to go into teaching, but was discouraged. I was told I was 'too smart' to be a teacher, and that the money sucked. When I became a single mother in my mid-20s, I decided I needed to finish my Bachelor's, and I might as well pursue teaching as I was still interested and would have roughly the same schedule as my child. 

What have been the high points of being a teacher?
When the students 'get it', and you see that light bulb go off in their heads. 

...The low points?
Physically restraining students from killing each other. Getting stabbed with pencils. Confiscating scissors so I didn't get stabbed with those. 

What advice would you give to new teachers?
Don't listen to the bitching of your peers. I can't stand that the majority of teachers I know bitch about the long hours and the homework.

What should new teachers focus on most?
Organization!

What is your teaching philosophy?
All students can learn, and it's our responsibility to ensure they do so to the best of their ability. "
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school Freshman.  I teach an honors level class and a lower level class with a majority of students with IEPs so the reading levels are all over the place. 

I am looking for secondary and tertiary sources, as well as primary sources, with comprehension and text-based evidence questions already made.  I have been making my own, and I really enjoy finding sources and making these activities, but it would be great to find a book with a bunch of World History-specific informational texts and primary sources targeted at these populations all in one place with questions already made.

For example, today I found an article about the effect of the widening resources used in the First Industrial Revolution on the environment in which the author was clearly biased so I had students identify words that showed this bias like ""rob,"" ""destroy,"" and ""deplete.""

Maybe I should just make and package what I a looking for..."
highschoolteachers,"&gt;Why did you become a teacher?

A great high school English teacher awakened me to my potential and the world's possibilities. Without him, who knows how I would have turned out. I decided to become a teacher because I wanted to inspire kids in the same way he inspired me.

&gt;What have been the high points of being a teacher?

I'm only a first-year teacher, so I don't have much experience to pull from. My favorite high point this year was when every single parent who came in for parent-teacher conferences said that I was their child's favorite teacher, and that they wouldn't shut up about how fun my class was at home.

&gt;...The low points?

The exhaustion. I'm currently assistant coaching baseball, and on the worst days I leave at 5am and get home at 1030pm.

&gt;What advice would you give to new teachers?

Be yourself. Don't try to be another teacher. Find your niche. 

&gt;What should new teachers focus on most?

Leaving time for themselves to be a human being outside of all the teaching, planning, and grading.

&gt;What is your teaching philosophy? 

A few kids will like you from day one just because of your looks, personality, or the subject material of the class. Most kids aren't going to care about you or your class until they see you care about them--not their grades, but their lives. When they see that you truly want them to be a better *human being*, and not just a better *student*, teaching will just be that much easier."
highschoolteachers,"To what end?  Already our kids go to college so they can be over-educated.  Unless high schools can give more vocational programs like in the old days, then I support considering eliminating the senior year of high school.  If kids want to stick around another year so they can take AP classes and some electives, then fine!  But let the others go."
highschoolteachers,"In Australia we have 4 terms, with 3 x 2 weeks off between the terms and a Christmas/summer break of around 6 weeks. So school is 40 weeks a year for about 6.5 hours a day with approximately 1.5 hours recess and lunch in primary and a bit over an hour in high school.  While it does sound great to have months off at a time, I feel like this feels less choppy while still giving one really good break a year."
