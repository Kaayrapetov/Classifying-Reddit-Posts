ElementaryTeachers,"-Sometimes redirection is just the name of the game, honestly. That is to say, reeling them back in to the task at hand. -kittiesandlaughs is right too, a good general rule is: if it does not seem like it should be happening, it probably should not be. And copy things you see other teachers doing that work! -In terms of the conversations about stuff like Fortnite and whatnot, redirect. Do a self check and make sure that if you are talking to the friends at your table, its a conversation about the activity! Or, That sounds like a really fun game that you can play when you get home. But right now, we need to be focusing on this! -Also it might be good to keep in mind that its just the beginning of the school year and its an after school program. So especially if you have got kids on the younger side of elementary school (kindergarten, first grade..) they are still getting accustomed to the school environment. -It being an after school program, the kids are likely pretty much spent by the time they get to you so they are almost always going to be a little off task at least. -Being cheerfully engaged usually works pretty well for me. -Be specific and direct with both critiques of a childs unwanted behavior and praise of their positive behavior. They benefit from being clear on exactly what the behaviors are that you do not want to see again, and why they should not do them. And also the exact behaviors you DO want to see more of and why they are good. -Negative example: You need to take your tennis shoes off of the table top because that is where you and your classmates eat. Your shoes have germs on the bottoms that will make you sick if they get in your food. -Positive example: I Am so impressed by how focused you are on this activity! You Are going to learn a lot with all those smart questions you are asking! -This would also be a good thing to keep in mind when the young girl does something like grabbing your arm again. Try saying something like, I do not appreciate it when you touch me without my permission. If you would like to hold my hand again next time, you need to ask and then wait until I Have said yes or no. -Yelling never solves anything and that is definitely not the sort of problem solving behavior you want to rub off on them. So when you are talking to a child about a negative behavior you have seen from them, calm but firm tones are key. -Its also usually good to try not to generalize your comments about a behavior to a point where the child then just starts to feel like they are the problem as a person. So avoid, You Are so off task, I Have asked you six times to come back to the table and work on the activity. And try, I Am noticing that your behavior is off task right now. I need you to come back to the table and continue working. -If the off task behavior continues and its really something that is bothering you, think about trying to find another way of doing the activity that may be more engaging to the students struggling to focus. -Also just in general its okay to be a little goofy with them on occasion. Kids love to laugh and they are more likely to respect someone who they like and feel a connection with! TLDR: sometimes you just got to redirect a lot, honestly. If it seems weird to you, it probably should not be happening. Be a copy cat for successful techniques from other teachers! Keep in mind they are likely still getting used to being back at school. Its after school too so their brains may be a little bit mushy already. Cheerful engagement from you can really help. Be specific and direct when talking about behaviors. No yelling, speak calmly and firmly. Never make a child feel like a negative behavior is part of who they are as a person. After a certain point, it might be good to try reconfiguring the activity a different way for the kids still struggling to focus. Its okay to be a little goofy sometimes with them!",sometimes redirection name game honestly say reeling back task hand kittiesandlaughs right good general rule seem like happening probably copy thing see teacher work term conversation stuff like fortunate whatnot redirect self check make sure talking friend table conversation activity sound like really fun game play get home right need focusing also might good keep mind beginning year program especially got kid younger side kindergarten first grade still getting accustomed environment program kid likely pretty much spent time get almost always going little task least cheerfully engaged usually work pretty well specific direct critique child unwanted behavior praise positive behavior benefit clear exactly behavior want see also exact behavior want see good negative example need take tennis shoe table top classmate eat shoe germ bottom make sick get food positive example impressed focused activity going learn lot smart question asking would also good thing keep mind young girl something like grabbing arm try saying something like appreciate touch without permission would like hold hand next time need ask wait said yes yelling never solves anything definitely sort problem solving behavior want rub talking child negative behavior seen calm firm tone key also usually good try generalize comment behavior point child start feel like problem person avoid task asked six time come back table work activity try noticing behavior task right need come back table continue working task behavior continues really something bothering think trying find another way activity may engaging student struggling focus also general okay little goofy occasion kid love laugh likely respect someone like feel connection told sometimes got redirect lot honestly seems weird probably happening copy cat successful technique teacher keep mind likely still getting used back brain may little bit mushy already cheerful engagement really help specific direct talking behavior yelling speak calmly firmly never make child feel like negative behavior part person certain point might good try reconfiguring activity different way kid still struggling focus okay little goofy sometimes,good general copy teacher sure table fun kid younger first accustomed much little least specific direct behavior positive clear behavior exact good negative table top shoe germ sick positive focused learn smart good young arm appreciate hold next child negative calm good comment child avoid table table general little goofy likely redirect weird successful likely mushy cheerful specific direct behavior speak child negative behavior certain different okay little
ElementaryTeachers,"If it feels like it should not be happening, it probably should not be happening. Does the school have some sort of behavior plan in place? For example, I was in a school that had a system of a TEAM line in the hallway. Toes forward, Eyes forward, Arms forward, and Mouths muted. I could call out kids in the hallway when they were not following a TEAM line. So check and see if the school has some sort of common language for expected behavior. Positive behavior reinforcment ALWAYS does wonders. Call out the good behaviors! Oh Jimmy thank you for being so respectful, responsible, kind, on task, helpful, etc. That can help the other kids get on track. Watch other teachers. See what works for them and try some things out!

Or with a friend? Does she have any special needs? Little ones often can not articulate these needs. Can Mom or Dad offer any insight? Then, what makes her tick? What does she love?

ElementaryTeachers,"First year teaching. Grain of salt, but would love feedback! One focus I have in my classroom is to know how to communicate (with peers/adults/self). How I introduce myself will also be an activity for the students to know how to listen, agree/disagree, and add-on to what I say. * Pre-assess how to agree/disagree with a point, providing examples * You could get silly with a kids and give non-examples of extreme agreeing (OMG I love your idea \*hug\*) or disagreeing (well...I would not yell at them, but you get the idea). * Tell students to see where they can agree or disagree in a story about you * This is a great way for them to *practice the communication skills* you want to see in your classroom * Talk about yourself! * Name, interesting fact, favorite hobby, pets, or any other ice-breaker facts * Do not forget any shameless plugs to colleges, favorite books, local/pro sports teams * Now is a great time to positively reinforce good communication skills of agreeing, disagreeing, or visual signs of active listing (looking at speaker, sitting up straight, etc) * ""Quiz time"" (fun worksheet) * Fill out a sheet to answer questions about your story, allowing space to draw instead of or to add on to answering with words * Table below being an example |Name|One word to describe me| |:-|:-| |Favorite subject|Interesting fact| * Allow students to make their own ""Get To Know Me"" worksheet to fill out the table with their own answers about themselves.

ElementaryTeachers,"Both of my jobs were accepted the first week in July. Some contracts are signed on again until relatively late which means the candidate pool is smaller, and worked out for me! That being said, I did not just walk in to my classroom. I did not get a summer job after college because getting a job was my job. My state and surrounding states were full- I knew that going in. So I applied to every school district and county in 4 states. It was literally a 9-5 job. I had to go far to get my first position. My second was much MUCH closer to home. I had binders for my interviews (I would do a digital one now though) that showed my work. I broke it down into categories with samples of my proudest work. I also had a little section in the back of a thank you note from a parent and all the notes kids wrote. It was just a cute personal touch one interviewer enjoyed a lot. You might have done one for student teaching, if not, spend the day/weekend working on it. It was a joy to make. My coworkers who hate interviews say they do not like to brag about themselves. I like interviews because you paint a picture of who you are and what your classroom is like to someone who has not been there. You get to share your passion with someone (or a group of people depending on the interview) who love teaching as much as you. You Are fresh out of college so your energy and enthusiasm to start your dream will be unmatched. But just to be prepared, look up common interview questions.

ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for your suggestions!,thanks suggestion,
ElementaryTeachers,"Good luck, you will do great! I Am changing districts now, and this is my second time interviewing from a distance with a new distance, here is some tips form my experience: -be SPECIFIC in your answers, try not to speak in the abstract, own your beliefs and your choices. (Also, for me, the mantra of be specific helps limit my nervous rambling lol) -research the school before you talk to them, makes you feel a little more at ease &amp; then you can start developing your own questions -think about what is important for YOU in a school. For example, its important to me that I work somewhere that values teacher input, so I ask each school I interview with what value does teacher input have in your school? Reactions to questions are just as telling as answers to questions -off of the above point, watch the TEACHERS reactions. For example, to the above question I once had two administrators talk on and on about their systems and how its important that they have teacher buy in &amp; they send surveys... meanwhile the teacher in the interview had suddenly become very quiet. Same question at another school and the teachers were talking over each other to rave about their admin and how valued they feel -if you know anyone even a little connected to the district you are moving to, REACH OUT. Check your schools alumni network, ask your advisors and professors your close with.

At his age with reading it is common to see children omit the middle and end sounds and sometimes the beginning of the word, they will reverse words, they will insert words that are not even there, or use part of a word to guess if they do not know the word, just to name a few things kids do when learning to read. This is all perfectly normal. Your school has probably given you some sight words for him to work on. Just focus on those. Have him practice writing and reading each word by itself, and have him look for those words while he is reading. If he misreads one of those words then remind him it is a sight word and to go back and check that he read it correctly. Any other words he misreads, I would not correct him, this way he will not get discouraged. As he master's sight word (he can read them quickly and correctly without having to think about it) then celebrate his success, remove those words from his practice words, and add new sight words to learn. He will love getting to check off words that he is mastered. You can do the same thing with any numbers that he writes backwards. Have him choose one or two numbers that he reverses and set a goal to write those numbers correctly. For example, he decides to focus on writing 4 correctly. After you finish math, remind him to check his number writing goal. If any 4s are backwards have him correct only that number. Once he consistently writes it correctly then celebrate and have him choose another number to focus on writing correctly.",described would concern age age reading common see child omit end sound sometimes beginning word reverse word insert word even use part word guess know word name thing kid learning read perfectly normal probably given sight word work focus practice writing reading word look word reading misreads one word remind sight word go back check read correctly word misreads would correct way get discouraged master sight word read quickly correctly without think celebrate success remove word practice word add new sight word learn love getting check word mastered thing number writes backwards choose one two number revers set goal write number correctly example decides focus writing correctly finish math remind check number writing goal backwards correct number consistently writes correctly celebrate choose another number focus writing correctly,common child omit read normal celebrate new write finish celebrate

ElementaryTeachers,"This is a poorly drawn example of the concept of multiplication as area. Color would have been better than all those stupid lines. See attached for two example on serve multiplication as area. First 2x3 and then 2/3 x 1/2. In each example, start at the bottom left corner of a grid of squares, and counted over one of the numbers of the multiplication problem. Then shade (in green in my drawing) all the grid squares that fall into that range from where you started that distance over. In my drawing I went over three. Then count up the other number of squares, or in this case 2, and then shade all the squares that are in this range (ie all the squares that are 2 or lower. You can see i shaded these yellow. How many squares are shaded both green and yellow? You can see that those 6 squares make up a rectangle that is 2 units by 3 units. So multiplication can be seen as area. When it comes to fractions, the same thing works, but you have to add new grid lines to subdivide accordingly. You can see for the 2/3 I subdivided the first column of squares into three equal columns which gives us 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 (which I simply labeled as 1), and I shaded the first two columns because that is 2/3rds. I then went up 1/2 and shaded across. You can see that 2 of these new smaller rectangles end up shaded both green and yellow out of a total of 6 little rectangles that together make up the first regular square (or the number 1). So, since numerator is the number of equal size pieces, and denominator is the total number of those equal size pieces that make up a whole, we get 2/6 as an answer. Hope that makes sense! If kids can learn this concept for how multiplication works, and how fractions can be represented (as both points along the number line that fall between the whole numbers AND as parts of the whole square) they will have a much deeper understanding of quantity going forward that will pay huge dividends in their understanding of all mathematics that is yet to come.

ElementaryTeachers,"First, for google classroom, since she has it from the district, I hope the district has people who can support with configuration and use. If she needs more help than they can give, or just wants another voice, check out https://sites.google.com/view/steampoweredlearning They are doing daily sessions to answer questions and help with google tools. I know the educator who runs this, and hes very good. For reading time, do you mean her reading a book to the kids? If so, I would not bother with slides and voice over. The students are accustomed to seeing her holding the book, and reading it to them. Find a well-lit (natural light is best) place in your home where she can sit and read the book outloud. Simply point your phone at her and record or use the webcam on the chromebook. I Am guessing your phone will make a better video. If you have a Bluetooth hands free setup so you can mic her, sound quality would be better. If you are going to invest money, do it on audio. Decide what your primary recording device will be...chromebook, phone, MacBook, whatever, and get a good mic that is compatible. I bought a Blue Snowball mic and it works very well on my MacBook for $70. Note: research exists about student performance and sound quality. In a classroom, even having a mic and speakers to amplify your voice can improve student performance and learning. Over computers, you want to really make sure your audio quality is solid especially with young kids. She can post the videos of her reading to google classroom so that it can only be seen by the kids and not the public. That Will remove issues around copyright. She can use google to host video chats with kids individually, small groups or even full group. I recently interviewed a first grade teacher who has been teaching online to first graders since 2016 for her tips and advice. Its on my podcast https://edmoxie.com/TL4Ed Look for the episodes with Tiffany Roberts. Ill be interviewing a 25 year veteran kindergarten teacher next weekend (4/18) to talk about science instruction with K-5 kids who are home. She can sign up and attend the live recording session if she wants to and ask questions to my guest expert. You Will see details on that on the same podcast I shared above. Tuesday (4/14) next week, Ill interview a school librarian about helping kids with reading and books,etc. with school and many public libraries closed. That Is on the schedule too. There must be other 1st grade teachers in her building/district? Teaming up would be helpful. Could be as simple as, when she wants to do 30 minutes of video meeting with her class, her peer teacher is there as a co-moderator to help push the buttons, etc as needed or even field questions from parents who are struggling with the tech. Likewise, she can do the same for her peer. Its tough to try and teach and troubleshoot at the same time...if someone has a baby brother that is crying in the background, knowing you have a partner who can mute that microphone is really helpful. She may find that for some lessons, its possible and beneficial to have both her classroom and her peers classroom together on one giant video meeting. If the goal that day was to simply read a book to the kids, then why not have one teacher read to all the kids instead of each of them repeating the process. The kids will like seeing the other kids from the other classes. That Is important for them. At school, they see each other at recess. Now, they may be limited to only seeing each other during these video calls, and then only with their main classroom group. So some of their friends will not be there since they may be in a different homeroom. They can also build it up as a treat that tomorrows story time will be special because they have a guest reader.

ElementaryTeachers,"I think knowing your students is so important. You can plan an amazing lesson but if your students are not interested in the content or cannot relate to it, it will not be effective. Try incorporating their interests into lesson plans. Kinesthetic activities are always great too, especially for younger students who are full of energy. I just wrote a phonics lesson that incorporated hopscotch, I had the kids jump on letters and sound them out at the same time, and then had them form words by hopping on letters and blending them. Brain breaks are also great to keep students engaged! It allows students to relax for a moment and regroup themselves.",think knowing student important plan amazing lesson student interested content cannot relate effective try incorporating interest lesson plan kinesthetic activity always great especially younger student full energy wrote phonics lesson incorporated hopscotch kid jump letter sound time form word hopping letter blending brain break also great keep student engaged allows student relax moment regroup,important lesson interested effective kinesthetic great younger full sound great keep

ElementaryTeachers,"Hello! First grade teacher here! Context for you; I went into student teaching and job searching thinking Id NEVER go below third grade. I swore intermediate was the life for me. Then I got a job offer in first grade.... Pros: HUGS. all the time. Many times a day. Even after you have to reprimand them. They hold no resentment. They Are enthusiastic. They Are funny (they got into an impassioned discussion the first day it snowed about whether or not the snowfall meant it was Christmas. It had not even been Thanksgiving yet). Lots and lots and lots of lightbulb moments. They learn so much at this age. Most of the time, they want to make you happy. They Are grateful (we did a cranberry science day before thanksgiving and they thanked me multiple times. For letting them eat cranberries. That they did not even like. To them, it was still fun.) They Are easy to impress. They love when I throw a mediocre at best drawing on an anchor chart. And I think the biggest pro is that they still believe in magic. Today we started Elf on a Shelf and they are obsessed. They still believe in the holiday magic and the magic of learning and they still think that you as their teacher are one of the best people ever. Cons: This is a very chatty age for them. They learn a lot from interacting with one another and they have a hard time distinguishing between good times to talk and not so good times to talk. Multi step directions...good luck. Its more like repeat the same directions multiple times. Many times they are still working on reading, so with early finishers sometimes telling them read a book is not the most viable option (personally, I still do it). They can be forgetful. They Have asked me for missing gloves, hats, scarves, etc. more times than I can count and it is not even December. Handwriting can be interesting. Short attention spans. Constantly being asked to tie shoes. Sometimes the shoe laces are in a hopeless knot because they tried to do it themselves. Personally, for me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

Will they fill in a sheet? When you have an idea of the objective the assessment kind of falls into place. If they hire you they will show you how they want lessons planned ...for now they are focused on how you teach.

ElementaryTeachers,"Congrats on your recent graduation!! The top 2 things I always looked for when I was hiring and interviewing teachers were **passion** and **growth mindset**. Since our school served a really specific population of students (Autism, ADHD, &amp; other learning disabilities), we needed teachers who were truly passionate about the work. It was also a startup school, which requires a lot of flexibility, so that was another key quality we needed. We provided a lot of in-house training and coaching, so we also looked for folks who are clearly committed to lifelong learning and always looking to proactively improve their practice. Whenever I applied for a teaching job, I would research the school ahead of time and include specific details in my cover letter about what uniquely appealed to me about their school, and what I could bring to the specific role I was applying for.

ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for that! Hypothetical scenario - a teacher to not acknowledge the pledge as a communial activity but rather having it as something that kids can opt in to in private - would that be seen as professional suicide? Or something that might actually be supported with good communication with parents?,thanks hypothetical scenario teacher acknowledge pledge communal activity rather something kid opt private would seen professional suicide something might actually supported good communication parent,hypothetical communal opt private professional good
ElementaryTeachers,"Teacher here, and no. I hate making my kids say it. There were only a few years that the schools I taught at did it regularly, and I actively told kids why we say it and always gave them the option to not participate.

It does not seem fair to make them pledge allegiance to a country that does not have their best interests at heart.",teacher hate making kid say year school taught regularly actively told kid say always gave option participate school taught also title school predominantly student color seem fair make pledge allegiance country best interest heart,told participate title fair pledge

ElementaryTeachers,"This was fascinating to come across. I work at an elementary school in a fairly liberal area in California that I grew up in as well. It is definitely not demanded that you say the pledge, but it is just some weird thing you were conditioned to do when you were young. In high school for me I do not recall it being as expected, and I definitely never said it once in college. The elementary schools however, it is scary. Kids are taught it is an every day routine before they even know what they are saying. Like I said I live in a pretty liberal area, I hate saying it, but feel like I would definitely be questioned if I did not say it in a public setting of a classroom or assembly, probably mostly by parents.",fascinating come across work fairly liberal area california grew well definitely demanded say pledge weird thing conditioned young recall expected definitely never said college school however scary kid taught every day routine even know saying like said live pretty liberal area hate saying feel like would definitely questioned say public setting classroom assembly probably mostly parent,liberal pledge weird young scary live liberal public

I go to a fairly liberal prep school- I Have read about the language being hypocritical but not about changing it. I agree that its creepy but did not realize most countries do not have pledges. I had high school teachers who would openly inform us that we have the right to not say the pledge. So when it came time to do it we would all just sit for a little bit and do nothing including the teacher. Legally, you CANNOT get in trouble for not doing it.

ElementaryTeachers,Thanks for your answers! I was just curious to learn the basics - I find it fascinating. I went to a religious school (in Ireland most schools are actually run by the Catholic Church - a bit of a social hangover from our darker years) but we had to pray daily with a priest who broadcasted over the school intercom into each classroom.

ElementaryTeachers,It is been the subject of alot of debate. You can probably find hundreds of news stories about students refusing to stand for the pledge and it becoming a huge controversy in their school/community. Alot of people (including me) see it as a first amendment right to not be forced to stand for it.

ElementaryTeachers,"I am a big believer in rich experiences with texts so I would say to do it all.you could change the focus each day. I mean, the characters are going to be either responding to another character or a plot point, so it makes sense. another option could be to jigsaw it- split the kids into groups, each group decides how the story affects a character and then presents that idea to the group. There is a lot of fun options! I often underestimate the power of repetition in my own teaching, but teach a skill any chance you get and there is a better chance of it sticking.",big believer rich experience text would say could change focus day mean character going either responding another character plot point make sense another option could jigsaw split kid group group decides story affect character present idea group lot fun option often underestimate power repetition teaching teach skill chance get better chance sticking,big rich split affect present underestimate better

ElementaryTeachers,"I think getting experience in real classrooms would be helpful! This will give you the chance to see if it is an area you feel comfortable being in. There is a lot of different aspects and parts to teaching that most people do not think about, so getting hands on experience will help you get a feel for if that is something you enjoy or want to do. Keep in mind, teaching is a lot more than just the fun work pages. Just because you do not think your personality is the ""teacher type"" does not mean you cannot be an awesome teacher.

ElementaryTeachers,"Try to get experience in schools. You can email different principles and say you are interested in teaching but not sure so you would like to observe for a day. You also should ask the chair of the education department if s/he knows anyone you can observe or talk to. I hate public speaking (still do in front of adults or groups of other teachers) but its different in front of kids for me. However, what you are feeling is completely valid. Some people are more bubbly in front of kids, some people are still shy/ awkward/ nervous regardless. Its wise to try to figure it out now before you are locked into a major. There also are other jobs that involve working with kids but not being a traditional teacher. Maybe you should consider that route too.

I always give it back at the end of class unless they are a repeat offender. Best advice I can give you is to not say anything when you take it. Just put your hand out. They know what you want, so do not give them a chance to argue/talk back. If you are working in a low-income school, or with a student who does not have a lot of material goods, it helps to put the item where they can see it. Like direct line of sight.

ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is a looooot more than being with the students, I think people who are not successful teachers start with the wrong idea. I started subbing as a way to earn money while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I never expected that while substitute teaching (and then assisting in a kindergarten classroom) I would fall in love with the profession, but the two years I spent subbing in schools allowed me to see a lot of what the other teachers were doing and understand that much more is involved with teaching than just being in the room so to speak. It is so much more than liking the age group, definitely takes a certain temperament to both do it well and enjoy it. If you have the flexibility to do so, I definitely recommend testing it out with substitute teaching first before making a significant time and money investment with a degree program.",teaching lookout student think people successful teacher start wrong idea started subbing way earn money figured wanted life never expected substitute teaching assisting kindergarten classroom would fall love profession two year spent subbing school allowed see lot teacher understand much involved teaching room speak much liking age group definitely take certain temperament well enjoy flexibility definitely recommend testing substitute teaching first making significant time money investment degree program,student successful wrong earn kindergarten teacher understand much certain recommend first significant

ElementaryTeachers,"Yes I use a visual checklist of about 5 things. After they learn your first most important 5 things, you can add more. Our school has a system of sending home work on Fridays using school buses, but I am assuming that is not an option for you. With the visual checklist, you have to teach and model each item. Maybe do a modeling lesson and independent practice each day for a week, so that after 5 days, they have seen and practiced each of the 5 items on the writing checklist. Then the next week bring it all together and show how to use the checklist with all 5 items. This age tends to like to check boxes regardless of it they should, so it will take practice and feedback about if they actually SHOULD check the box. Begin every writing time with a mini-lesson of using the checklist on your own story or a student's story. Have kids work in pairs and use the checklists with each other's stories. It just takes lots of repetition, time to practice, and feedback.",yes use visual checklist thing learn first important thing add system sending home work friday using bus assuming option visual checklist teach model item maybe modeling lesson independent practice day week day seen practiced item writing checklist next week bring together show use checklist item age tends like check box regardless take practice feedback actually check box begin every writing time mini lesson using checklist story student story kid work pair use checklist story take lot repetition time practice feedback,visual important visual independent practiced next use checklist checklist checklist

I think one thing to take into consideration is the age of your students. I have worked in elementary ed and preschool and have gotten very few questions or comments on it. Whenever I was questioned I just explained to students that 'most adults have hair on their legs/armpits. Some people choose to to shave it off and some people choose not to, it just depends on the person.' Usually that is enough of an explanation for them.

You could also add in a station where they practice tracing the alphabet, numbers, and their name using their finger on a sensory bag by putting shaving cream or some gel in a plastic bag and taping the closure shut. Id also recommend taping a piece of construction paper to the back of the bag for contrast so they can see the letter formation better. You could also have them make their own bag during an art station, and they could add food coloring or glitter. If the center has some cd-players, you might be able to get some audiobooks from the library for the kids to listen to.

Plus it really counts in your favor as experience when you are applying and interviewing for teaching jobs because administrators know how hard it is to get and keep a good sub, and how challenging subbing is. Subbing is also a great way to get your foot in the door in a school or district that you like. You can try out a bunch of different schools, find one or more that you really like and become a regular sub there.

They had a grade level team of 5, and the kids were divided so some rotated between 3 teachers and the others rotated between 2 teachers. My mentor teacher was a part of the three-way rotation. She and her colleagues were very rude. One had the audacity to ask me, Are you sure you are cut out for this? with a giant smile on her face. It was bad. When the year started, they divided the children based on standardized test scores. There was a high, middle, and low class. This was poor planning, because all of the children with IEPs ended up in the low group and it was difficult to teach. This experience put a bad taste in my mouth for upper grades. I requested to do my final semester of student teaching in first grade because the teacher was, well, amazing. Plus a couple of the kids I had in kinder were now in her room. My request was granted, and I got along swimmingly with that teacher. It made me feel like I was meant for first grade. She taught me so much more than any course I took. She also loved her kids. All the while I taught these grades, I also student taught in special education because my university wanted everyone to have dual certification. I completed the requirements and all, but I never took the sped praxis. Idk if I still can, but its not something I want to pursue. I enjoyed my time in sped with the kids, but there is no way Id want to deal with their paperwork and the legalities of it. I started my third year teaching on Sept. 1. I taught second grade for two years but this year I Am teaching fifth grade reading. I teach at a magnet school that was a National Blue Ribbon School in 2019.

ElementaryTeachers,"Agreed that the hardest part of student teaching is working so hard for zero dollars. I did student teaching in a 1st grade classroom in Virginia. I was with the class for 12 weeks and also got a long-term sub job after the student teaching ended. I learned so much. Behavior management is arguably the trickiest part of teaching. You get lots of good practice being in control (or pretending to be in control lol). The main thing I did not practice that is a tricky part of the job is parent communication. My lead teacher did most of the communicating, but that might be different for you.

The lesson plans are already laid out from the host teacher- so I just have to follow those and make them more of my own when I teach. The district/school usually follow multiple curriculums that have lesson plans already- they do not teach that in our college courses. Haha. My supervisor does 6 observations during the 12 week period- I Am bit worried about them, they do those to help us become better teachers. I am a mom of 4 kids ages 5 and under. I Have been a stay at home mom for 3 years so that has been a HUGE adjustment. And the cost of childcare is ridiculous. Its difficult working a full time job and getting zero paychecks.

By breaking the math concepts up, you are working within students working memory potential and not overloading them with concepts being more accessible for all learners.",recommendation would use penny corresponds nicely number place value focus one math concept time student learning subtract decimal number whole value teach penny math focus rounding teach student breaking math concept working within student working memory potential overloading concept accessible learner,penny subtract decimal whole penny teach potential accessible

Way more so than the in person learners.

Also, they are learning to use mouses, typing, recording videos, taking pictures, blogging! F2F learners at my school are not doing all of this. They are also troubleshooting their technology pretty frequently too! I have got my LMS set up so that the kids can be 100% independent as well. Unless they do not understand the content, the parents are reporting that the kids are doing it all essentially by themselves. One parent messaged me saying that their children's independence, time management, self-motivation, and confidence have risen exponentially from where they were at the beginning of this year (they have 5 children, 4 in school, 3 of them are mine [they are triplets]). He said that he feels like his kids' study habits will be so advanced, that they will not struggle like he did as a student. There are SO many negatives about remote learning. There is so much complaining, and it sucks in a lot of ways. But I choose to focus on the positives. I am seeing a ton of growth in my kids that do the work.

ElementaryTeachers,"I knew of a male student while he was k-2nd grade and he only wore girls clothes to school. and I Am talking sequins and tutus, not just dresses. For the most part, everyone was totally cool with it. I do not think he knew what trans or crossdressing ir genderfluid might mean, which I believe is a good thing at such a young age. I think it was good he did not have a label for himself yet. Kids would often ask him why he wore girls clothes or if he was a girl or a boy and he would answer confidently that he was a boy who liked to wear girls clothes and there is nothing wrong with that. Kids would accept his answer and move on with whatever game they were playing. I would occasionally hear some remarks from the older teachers saying they disagreed with his clothing choices or would say who really knows who they are in first grade... etc in the staff room, but never says anything offensive to him or any other parents/students and were protective if him as any other child in their class. I think as long as its not a big deal and you raise him to be confident about it it will be fine. That being said, this child I knew was definitely acting on his own interests and his folks were along for the ride. He told me he hated boys clothes and wanted to be a girls fashion designer when we grew up.

Keep in mind that the majority of the apps are 4th grade math focused since my grade level team teaches (I teach all three classes math). IXL - math practice - I like this program since it can match the adopted math program used in my district using ""skill plans"". XtraMath - math fact practice (mostly multiplication facts). I like this app since it tracks what facts students know well and which ones they need to practice. It also shows the students the answer if they get it incorrect and makes them type in the correct answer which helps them memorize the facts faster. ClassHero - Math practice but this also allows the students to choose an achievement and earn ""badges"" which are like trading cards with famous scientists on them. It is also easy to assign math topics that match the unit where currently studying. Whooo's Reading - Great way for kids to track their daily reading and also respond to their reading through providing feedback. The app automatically checks their writing and encourages them to add more detail and though as well as correct and spelling, punctuation, and grammar. The three classes are competing to see which class can have the most reading minutes and writing entries each month. [Video.link](https://Video.link) (formerly Safe YouTube). Whenever we want to show a YouTube video, we always use [Video.link](https://Video.link) since it removes ads and suggestions to other YouTube videos plus it can be edited (cropped).

ElementaryTeachers,This maybe an unpopular opinion but enjoy teaching all subjects. At my last school we had two teachers per grade level. One planned reading and social studies and the other math and science. This broke up the work load and we got to focus on our strengths. It was still collaborative and we incorporated our own style even if we did not plan that subject. At another school we taught all subjects and had little to no collaboration. It was pretty awful. It was unfortunate the year I was placed with another teacher that was also stronger in reading and social studies. We were able to work together on the math and science plans but I would have been uncomfortable being responsible for 50 kids learning math and science all year. Having only my class of 25 gave me more time to focus on those teaching strategies and I think it made me a more effective and well rounded teacher in the long run.,maybe unpopular opinion enjoy teaching subject last two teacher per grade level one planned reading social study math science broke work load got focus strength still collaborative incorporated style even plan subject another taught subject little collaboration pretty awful unfortunate year placed another teacher also stronger reading social study able work together math science plan would uncomfortable responsible kid learning math science year class gave time focus teaching strategy think made effective well rounded teacher long run,unpopular subject last teacher social focus collaborative subject subject little awful unfortunate stronger social able responsible effective long

That way she gets some time. But for some reason a part of me is not completely satisfied because Id assume conversations are very surface level. I was not going to tell her that though. I think I Am classrooms you are able to build more rapport. I guess the main reason why I liked SLP was because I enjoyed building language barriers.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I Am currently in a elementary teacher residency, and our program is almost finished, so the most experience I have had has been working as a co teacher everyday in a Title I school. Ill be starting as a general education teacher in my own classroom at the beginning of the next school year. I decided to become a general education teacher because I wanted to work with large groups on academics, SEL, and create inclusive classroom environments that promote students critical thinking, self reflection, and their care for peers and the larger community (not any different than other general education teachers, I Am sure! ) However, I could not do my job without dedicated interventionists, counselors, SPED teachers, and other educational roles in the school (like SLPs!). From my experience, their ability to build a relationship with students is vital to helping students who may feel marginalized in the general education classroom because of the barriers you talk about. Plus, schools need SLPs and interventionists in the school community. They are a vital part of serving students. What is it that is making you interested in being in the classroom as a gen-ed lead? I agree with the post above. Spend some time in a classroom (whenever that is available again, ahh!), observe the workload and the details of the job, and have fun with the kids!

ElementaryTeachers,"I Am 16 years in and I have this conversation with myself almost every year! I love love love to teach, but all the outside factors, politics, lack of funds, lack of respect- it can really bog you down. Some things that helped me are: 1. Find a good therapist!! 2. Set firm boundaries to keep school and home separate. When I first started teaching, Id go in super early every day, stay late, go in on the weekends, answer emails in the evening. Now, I do not check my email once I get home, even on the weekends. I only go in on the weekends once a month. And I plan one late night a week to catch up on everything. It was really uncomfortable at first, and I had serious teacher FOMO when all my friends would be in on the weekend together. But the more consistent I am with this, and the more I can really unplug from the job and be present with my family, the more recharged I feel the next day for school. (Btw, my therapist really walked me through this whole process) I also think there is no shame is saying goodbye! I Have almost done it multiple times! Some other jobs to consider are Montessori teaching, instructional coach, school librarian, online teaching, or even trying another grade level to mix it up. I also got certified as a yoga teacher and I do that on the side, but I could turn it into a full time thing, if I ever decide to take the plunge!

I personally see it as helping children learn how to be little humans so they can have a strong foundation as they continue to grow in their education and life. But I could see how it may not feel that way for others. Lessons need to be a lot shorter. If you are the kind of teacher that really likes to dig into things, you may feel like you are running out of time before the children start lose interest. Or not be able to plan our complex or what you may consider more fun activities. Other thing to look at is the impact early childhood education has on childrens life. ECE is still growing but the research does not lie, children need intervention earlier! If your passion is in education then maybe that can be some positive motivation :)",think biggest thing would ready behavior constantly like mentioned could first time lot kiddos adult hard wrap brain around sometimes difficult teach typical way may feel like cannot teach academic correcting teaching behavior age reality feel really frustrating teacher may like activity go planned heard lot teacher say cannot work younger child feel much like babysitting personally see helping child learn little human strong foundation continue grow education life could see may feel way others lesson need lot shorter kind teacher really like dig thing may feel like running time child start lose interest able plan complex may consider fun activity thing look impact early childhood education childrens life ece still growing research lie child need intervention earlier passion education maybe positive motivation,biggest first hard difficult teach typical academic behavior cannot much learn little human strong shorter dig child lose able complex childhood positive
ElementaryTeachers,I work with younger kids a good amount so I kind of understand how they learn. What would you suggest looking into before deciding to go to college for teaching younger kids? And thank you for replying to my question.,work younger kid good amount kind understand learn would suggest looking deciding go college teaching younger kid thank replying question,good younger
ElementaryTeachers,"Can I ask the last time you worked with younger children? I would say you have to do a lot more explicit teaching. You never really want to assume what students know ever but at these younger ages that is especially true. Teaching specific behaviors and expectations. How to be a student at the school (walking, quiet in the halls, ect.). Lots of social emotional work and some academics that you would expect. I just think its important to remember that kindergartner could be the very first time some kids are in a formal/structured environment for long periods of time. I think you have to be really mindful, compassionate, and full of patiences in this grade level. The most basic of skills are not easy the first time doing it!",ask last time worked younger child would say lot explicit teaching never really want assume student know ever younger age especially true teaching specific behavior expectation student walking quiet hall ect lot social emotional work academic would expect think important remember kindergartner could first time kid formal structured environment long period time think really mindful compassionate full patience grade level basic skill easy first time,last younger want assume younger true specific behavior quiet social emotional important formal structured mindful full first

I do not know if this is the feedback you are necessarily looking for specifically, but I just wanted to let you know that you do not have to compare yourself to your classmates! It sounds like you have a classic case of imposter syndrome. You are in school right now to prepare yourself for a job you are interested in, you do not have to be super experienced right now! I did my undergrad in graphic design, and always felt like my classmates were all so much better, more experienced, and more talented, but now looking back, we were all in it together and had our own unique strengths and weaknesses! To actually try to answer your question- you can look for part-time work or volunteer opportunities for kids camps, after school programs, activities. You can also babysit or basically do anything that just gets you more experienced with children! I am currently getting my masters in Library Science with a Youth Services Certificate and licensure in hopes to become an elementary art teacher. I know what you mean because I also do not have tons of experience teaching kids or anything like that. But I know those things come with time and everything I am doing is preparing me for those experiences. I hope this made you feel better!

ElementaryTeachers,"Been there done that 1. Look on line at your district's information sheets and contacts for kindergarten enrollment. Read what they say on the site, but also give them a call. Discuss your concerns. The reality is that while districts want $$ that comes from enrollment, they very much want kids who are ready for school I would imagine that is doubly so this year with the need to focus on learning recovery due to covid disruptions. You are very far from unique, and they will be able to discuss your situation and lay out what options they have this particular year (again those may be different due to covid recovery stuff). Again -- being ""bored"" in kindergarten is not a problem. Being underwater in 7th - 9th grade is a huge problem with serious consequences. Our son who we held back is a senior this year in college (held back again due to being overseas when covid hit and having to lose a term as Germany's semesters do not mirror up with American semesters.) He is doing great. Our daughter who had the 3 friends held back is also doing fine. She did decently well through high school and played 4 years of college soccer. She is now in her 2nd year of residency for O/P. One of the other girls of the 4 also played 4 years of college soccer (must have been that absolutely fantastic kindergarten soccer coach they had) and she is in her 3rd year of Med school. Another is a newly minted lawyer once she passes the bar exam this summer, and the last is a neo-natal RN. Would they have been the same if they had moved ahead? Who knows, but they make a pretty good argument for holding back.",done look line district information sheet contact kindergarten enrollment read say site also give call discus concern reality district want come enrollment much want kid ready would imagine doubly year need focus learning recovery due couid disruption far unique able discus situation lay option particular year may different due couid recovery stuff bored kindergarten problem underwater the the grade huge problem serious consequence son held back senior year college held back due overseas couid hit lose term germany semester mirror american semester great daughter friend held back also fine decently well played year college soccer and year residency i one girl also played year college soccer must absolutely fantastic kindergarten soccer coach red year med another newly minted lawyer pass bar exam summer last neo natal in would moved ahead know make pretty good argument holding back,enrollment much due unique able particular different due kindergarten huge serious senior due lose american great played fantastic red last neo good

ElementaryTeachers,"Not a teacher. BTDT with 2 of 4 kids. My personal suggestion would be to (1) explore available pre-K options. If non stand out, then consider sending ahead with the express understanding that he is going to repeat K a second year. We did that with 2 of ours with October birthdays and a September 1 cut date. We obviously kept up on things with the teacher during the year. It made a huge difference. The oldest was a girl and she went from a well behaved but a bit behind in academics too a friendly leader. Once we made the decision we learned that 3 other girl parents from the same school also decided to hold their kids back. (We still know all the girls well and all did well academically and socially.) It worked well for our daughter so with the next - son with another October birthday, it was a no brainer. He did 1/2 day K 1st year and full day K second year. The big issue is what happens to young kids when they hit middle school. Being ahead a bit in K is one hell of a lot better than being behind physically, and in maturity, when you are in middle school. That is when the costs of starting young are paid. The facts are that you cannot tell the future. But, if you can give a better chance then you do it.",teacher but kid personal suggestion would explore available pre i option non stand consider sending ahead express understanding going repeat i second year october birthday september cut date obviously kept thing teacher year made huge difference oldest girl went well behaved bit behind academic friendly leader made decision learned girl parent also decided hold kid back still know girl well well academically socially worked well daughter next son another october birthday brainer day i it year full day i second year big issue happens young kid hit ahead bit i one hell lot better behind physically maturity cost starting young paid fact cannot tell future give better chance,personal available birthday cut huge oldest academic friendly girl next birthday full second big young i young future better

ElementaryTeachers,A behavior chart is a good idea. You can also start teaching how to use I statements. You could do this with everyone and go over expectations for how to play nice together and role play certain situations. Example of an I statement: I feel .... When you/because..... You can model this for the students and they will see how to use it. You could also start praising students with rewards if you see/ hear them using the I statements in play with each other.

They would then hang it up on the wall with the main goal for alot of teachers being getting their classroom decorated.

Most programs require you to be in the classroom for observation for dozens and dozens of hours. Id recommend while you working in college, find a school program (afterschool, club, amusement park, summer camp) where toy are working directly with students. I like afterschool program setting because its a great simulator for the classroom. Best of luck on observation and studies. If you have any questions reply here or DM work too.

ElementaryTeachers,"Do not be a teacher. The year my wife taught nearly killed them. As a new teacher, there was zero chance of being in a good school, because those were the positions everyone wanted and they only accepted experienced teachers. They were told point-blank ""You are new, so we are giving you a class with all the worst kids in the school."" It was not a joke. Kids that slept, that attended school only to sell drugs, kids that cursed or threatened, and at one point the class made up a song about how they were going to get my wife fired because they found out about me. (We are a lesbian couple.) That would have been bad enough, but the administration basically turned around and blamed my wife for everything that went wrong stating that if kids failed, it was the teacher's fault for ""not connecting,"" even though my wife was doing absolutely everything they asked, up to and including working almost seven days a week and spending our own money to try and keep the classroom together. Echoing the others here, do not think it is your job to try and teach just because there is a need. The TRUTH is that there are a lot of incredible teachers out there; it is the SYSTEM that needs to change. You might want to see if there is a non-teaching position like lunch staff, office, after-school, etc. My aunt does this primarily so she can get insurance, and it is much less soul-sucking.

Just check out r/teachers for a look at what is going on the US. Insanely low pay, no air conditioning, no toilet paper, buy your own supplies, students that are apathetic with parents that do not care and YOU get blamed for all of it. Teachers are constantly, constantly scapegoated all. the. time. A lot of time about stuff they do not even have control over. We are told to ""do it for the kids"" and neglect our own health and families in order to do so. If you do not martry yourself, you are painted as a ""bad"" teacher by admin often.

ElementaryTeachers,"Yes, I have a limit on copies, but I do not usually go over mine (resource teacher) and it is totally INSANE that they are charging you for copies. It is annoying and garbage and just another drop in the bucket of horrible working conditions for teachers in the US. If I were you, I would let a local news outlet know that - that is asinine. For me, I usually get through the year by using lapboards (dry erase marker stored in a black sock which serves as an eraser) and these [dry erase pockets](https://www.amazon.com/C-Line-Reusable-Pockets-Inches-Assorted/dp/B002RUG8WU/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_i=B002RUG8WU&amp;psc=1). If you go with the pockets, put a thinner piece of cardboard in there to make it stiff enough to write on. You can actually store a couple different worksheets in the pockets and have the kids switch them out as needed.

ElementaryTeachers,"I think, ""Due to circumstances beyond my control"" and taking ""extended leave"" is a great idea. It is still honest, but lacking all the gory details. Thanks for the suggestion! Unfortunately, they have not found replacements for the other teachers who have left. So yes, it was an unbearably difficult decision to make, knowing that the students may be in the hands of a non-certified substitute. You would think the district would have made some serious changes before it got to this point, knowing how many teachers have been leaving and not being able to hire replacements. Despite this very issue keeping me awake at night, I know this is absolutely what I need to do.

ElementaryTeachers,"First of all, good for you for looking out for your own well-being and doing what is best for you. Teachers put themselves last far too often and are often encouraged to do so. This cannot have been an easy decision for you. How transparent are you comfortable being about your decision to leave? Would it make sense to tell families that due to circumstances beyond my control, I will be taking an extended leave from the classroom? (I AM GOING TO, they do not need to know that extended = permanent!) I would keep it short and emphasize how grateful you are to have worked with their kids/how much you appreciate their support in this challenging year, etc. etc. Let them know their students will be in great hands with your replacement and if they have any questions about their new teacher, please reach out to (insert name of someone who is not you here). As far as when to tell them, I think sooner is better so it does not feel like you are springing it on them and so your students have time to adjust to the idea of you leaving. Sorry for the long response but I hope some part of it is helpful! Best of luck to you in your new chapter! :)",first good looking well best teacher put last far often often encouraged cannot easy decision transparent comfortable decision leave would make sense tell family due circumstance beyond control taking extended leave classroom going need know extended permanent would keep short emphasize grateful worked kid much appreciate support challenging year etc etc let know student great hand replacement question new teacher please reach insert name someone far tell think sooner better feel like springing student time adjust idea leaving sorry long response hope part helpful best luck new chapter,good best last cannot easy comfortable due short grateful much great new insert adjust sorry long luck new

ElementaryTeachers,"I teach kindergarten but we have a school-wide PBIS system so the kids can earn loot like a paper dollar and turn it in for a chance to win winner Wednesday when the principal draws some loot the kids wrote their names on and win a special prize or activity. You could do a winner bucket with your class, and try snd do some coupons or some other classroom reward. We Have also done points - the class get one when they do the right thing, you get one when you have to remind them or wait for them to get quiet. We also have sticker charts and a prize bucket. Sometimes it helps just to get them in the habit of doing the right thing. We also give them a number in their daily folder to show how their choices were they day - needed lots of reminders, did well, etc. Class Dojo is a great app to give kids points for different positive traits, and you can take them away too.

ElementaryTeachers,My students needed help with communication so I did an activity where they had to sort themselves into groups all while communicating effectively. I had them try the first time with no help as they sort of themselves from birthdays starting January 1 all the way to December 31. They would likely stumble through this and need help and might not be able to get everybody lined up in a time limit you decide. Once this happens pause take everyone over to the carpet or meeting area and discuss what worked well and what did not work well. Give a few pointers like electing teams to work with months or a process of discussion like hand raising. Then let them try again. After that is all done and you have established a few communication strategies that you want students to use do the activity again but for this one you cannot talk. I found stickers different different colors and place them on every students forehead. Students must then use nonverbal communication skills through body language in ways that are effective. My students really like this challenge and all of my students really need help with communicating effectively. Hopefully this helps! Good luck and have a great year!!,student needed help communication activity sort group communicating effectively try first time help sort birthday starting january way december would likely stumble need help might able get everybody lined time limit decide happens pause take everyone carpet meeting area discus worked well work well give pointer like electing team work month process discussion like hand raising let try done established communication strategy want student use activity one cannot talk found sticker different different color place every student forehead student must use nonverbal communication skill body language way effective student really like challenge student really need help communicating effectively hopefully help good luck great year,first january able lined pause process different different forehead nonverbal effective good great

Its almost as if flexibility just is not a strong suit and its just so hard to work with when that is literally one of the biggest things about teaching.

ElementaryTeachers,"Aw, thanks! Back at ya. And I am sure you do fine with the seating charts. Still, it is like preparing for a major diplomatic meeting sometimes, is not it? LOL So, my classroom has 13 students and 4 tables. Obviously, that does not divide perfectly, so I have 3 tables of 3 and one of 4 (I actually started with 16 before they made another class and moved 3 kids out, because admin, of course, wants to make sure they can keep reminding parents that our class sizes are smaller than average). Part of that at least works out well, since everyone wants to sit at the green table (they are all painted different colors), so I can put 4 at the green table. I am trying to rotate who is at which table each month so that everyone has a chance to work with everyone else but at the same time not put my chattiest students together, if that makes sense. I have two boys who are best buds, and while I love that they are, I am worried that they would distract each other constantly at the same table (I will probably let them sit together at some point with the stipulation that they will get moved if talking becomes an issue). I also let the students spend class points to sit at the green table, with the understanding that we need to let everyone have a chance at sitting there (I have no idea why it is popular, but, hey, I can work with that). When we do morning meetings or circle time or anything like that, I let them sit wherever, of course. If I had desks, I would probably do groups as well, assuming they were open front desks. The nice thing is that you can change the seating around most anytime (""Oh, it was just getting a little boring!"" or some such). I like table arrangements for group work, but unless you can make them all even, I know it could get weird for partner work.",aw thanks back ya sure fine seating chart still like preparing major diplomatic meeting sometimes lol classroom student table obviously divide perfectly table one actually started made another class moved kid admin course want make sure keep reminding parent class size smaller average part least work well since everyone want sit green table painted different color put green table trying rotate table month everyone chance work everyone else time put chattiest student together make sense two boy best bud love worried would distract constantly table probably let sit together point stipulation get moved talking becomes issue also let student spend class point sit green table understanding need let everyone chance sitting idea popular hey work morning meeting circle time anything like let sit wherever course desk would probably group well assuming open front desk nice thing change seating around anytime oh getting little boring like table arrangement group work unless make even know could get weird partner work,ya sure fine major diplomatic lol table kid admin sure parent smaller average least green different green table else chattiest table student green popular hey open nice oh little boring table weird

ElementaryTeachers,"I am not saying it should be quick-fire, or that there should not be restorative practices. If it helps, I would like to say I actually agree with you - there has been a lot of trauma, some people are too quick to be punitive, and being punitive typically only ""works"" with kids who are not usually in trouble anyway. I do feel however that while that individual kid has been through trauma, so has the rest of the class, and so has the teacher. When the same kid has just pulled the rest of the class off topic for the 8th time in 3 days... Well maybe everyone needs a break. Honestly, sometimes the kids themselves need a break. People are human and when you are on edge, in a negative spiral etc., you sometimes need a little distance to reset. A former administrator of mine used to call parents and say ""this is what happened. I am not suspending little Johnny, but he needs some space and needs to go home for the rest of the day before he actually does get himself in trouble."" When he comes back, that is when the restorative piece comes back. It is not punitive, but it does allow the situation to die down a little before punitive measures are necessary.",saying quick fire restorative practice help would like say actually agree lot trauma people quick punitive punitive typically work kid usually trouble anyway feel however individual kid trauma rest class teacher kid pulled rest class topic the time day well maybe everyone need break honestly sometimes kid need break people human edge negative spiral etc sometimes need little distance reset former administrator mine used call parent say happened suspending little johnny need space need go home rest day actually get trouble come back restorative piece come back punitive allow situation die little punitive measure necessary,quick agree trauma punitive individual rest need need break human negative spiral little former call suspending little johnny restorative punitive punitive necessary

ElementaryTeachers,"One activity I have done in the past is created a Mad Libs kind of game. The activity was sort of two fold in reinforcing what certain parts of speech are. I usually stuck with Nouns, Verbs, and sometimes Adjectives. I let the students think of a topic and I created a sheet where I started off writing a beginning sentence, the students had to finish it.

ElementaryTeachers,"I would recommend looking for teaching assistant positions and checking private schools. I knew I wanted to teach when I graduated undergrad but did not have an education degree either. I started with an assistant teaching job at a private school and got more experience that way. It will not be your own classroom, but it is a start and a great learning experience. It also might depend on where you live. Some states have teacher shortages and you might be able to get a provisional license (especially if you have skills that are in high demand, like being fluent in another language). If you decide you want to get your license, you might be able to find certification programs that are less demanding/costly than an actual degree in education. When I was deciding to go back to school for my teaching license, I made an advising appointment at a university near me. I did not end up going there and chose a different school, but I was still able to talk with the advisor about how long it would take to be certified, cost, etc. It helped me compare options. You could also consider Teach for America. I know it is sort of controversial, but it is a way to get your license and more experience. I did not do TFA so I cannot say much more about it. There are also AmeriCorps programs that are education-related, and you get an education award upon completion of your program, so that can help with expenses of going back to school.

ElementaryTeachers,"What grade will you be teaching? My first year I had the bare minimum but it was totally ok! You use what you have and will manage as you go. My beginning of year list looks like this: I make labels for many of the things; it is super helpful for you and the kids.I teach first so the more organized things are the better.I am going on year 7 and I have tried many things!. First graders definitely need more than the older grades. If the kids know where everything is and can be independent that is ideal and will help greatly with management. Most things I label with their name, but other things I label with their number. I give them each their own little pencil basket at their desk. I include scissors(labeled with their number), glue stick(labeled with their number, 2 pencils, an eraser, and a dry erase marker. I also label their HW FOLDER with their name and one side is take home, one is bring back. You can make these or look online because they are a ton of free materials! I label math journals, writing journals, etc. I also give them each their own book baggie or reading bin and label it. I also make two sets of popsicle sticks with their names. One set is for randomly calling on students or creating random partners, etc. The other set I use for consequences. I set up three little envelopes and put them on a bulletin board. One says warning, one says 5 min out of recess and the third is call home. The can independently move their popsicle stick to one of the folders when told to do so. I also like using the popsicle sticks because the other students cannot see who is in warning, etc. I also use popsicle sticks (or ones that look like people) for class jobs. I use the small envelopes for each job. Within the jobs, I include line leader. The line leader is always posted above our door. Each job lasts a week. I would not worry too much about the bulletin boards because it is okay if they are blank when you begin the year. I usually have one bulletin board with a sign that says ""welcome first graders"" and then take first day photos of them and put them up on the board. As you begin teaching and they are creating work, you can work on your bulletin boards. Is there any chance your district would purchase any books for you or a carpet? We can only have ""fire retardant"" carpets so before you buy anything double check with the school! In terms of organization, I have a place for everything and trust me it makes all the difference! I have drawers LABELED (words and picture) for paper clips, post its, lost and found, extra glue sticks, extra highlighters, pencils. The kids love flexible seating but I found that it has to be introduced super slowly because they can get a little crazy otherwise! My kids really like the scoop chairs and we use lap desks for writing which they love. BUT, like I said.. it takes a while to build up to this. so start with the things that you would need for the first week. Plus, Corona has really made a mess of everything and who knows what the fall will bring! It is good you are thinking about these things now!

ElementaryTeachers,"Ill be a first year teacher in the fall, so I still struggle with making new ideas for meetings. I wish that my ideas were more exciting but I have some basic ideas right now! For greetings: We had a very bad flu bug going around this year (pre-corona) and it got to the point where we did more distant greetings. Its not quite the same, but we had the kids do the same greetings with near-touches. For example, they would high-five or fist bump with a few inches between the kids. I imagine that these simple greetings could work with social distance as long as the kids went around the circle in order. We also did a lot of knock-knock greetings and funny voice greetings. I feel like dice greetings could be replicated with technology if the teacher leads everything (like maybe the kids say when to press the button on your phone if there is a dice app or something). For activities: We would also bend the share/activity dynamic to fit the needs of the day in my class. For example, we would do a read aloud, education YouTube video, or song for a share or activity. We would bend it by saying well listen to x as the activity or I (the teacher) wanted to share x with you today. I also feel like some GoNoodles could be fun activities for social distancing if there was enough space in the classroom. My kids also LOVED Mad Libs when we learned about parts of speech, but I feel like that could work anytime.",ill first year teacher fall still struggle making new idea meeting wish idea exciting basic idea right greeting bad flu bug going around year pre corona got point distant greeting quite kid greeting near touch example would five fist bump inch kid imagine simple greeting could work social distance long kid went around circle order also lot knock knock greeting funny voice greeting feel like dice greeting could replicated technology teacher lead everything like maybe kid say press button phone dice app something activity would also bend share activity dynamic fit need day class example would read aloud education youtube video song share activity would bend saying well listen i activity teacher wanted share i today also feel like noodles could fun activity social distancing enough space classroom kid also loved mad libs learned part speech feel like could work anytime,first new wish basic bad kid touch fist social kid funny press dynamic fit aloud i social enough mad

ElementaryTeachers,"I just saw this, but I hope it went well!!! I Am also an introvert and HATE interviewing. I like to prepare answers for questions I anticipate ahead of time and I Have even put my answers next to me during interviews. I do not read from my notes, but Ill glance down and make sure I said everything I wanted to. Nobody has ever said anything about it before, but if they had I was just planning on saying that I put a lot of thought into my answers and wanted to make sure that I fully conveyed my ideas. Also, do not be afraid to pause and think about your answer. I used to feel like I had to start talking immediately after a question and then I would catch myself saying stupid things that I would not have if I took a moment to process. Once I learned to slow down, I was better at more eloquently stating my answer.

ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is not for everyone. Personally I love it, but I work with teachers who wish they would chosen a different path. I teach grades 3 and 4 and have been an elementary teacher for thirteen years. I plan on retiring a teacher in fifteen years. I agree with the comment about working for adequate pay. Would I be a teacher for $30 000/yr - no. That Is a standard of living choice. If you are constantly worried about paying the bills you cannot really be happy in anything you are doing. I Am lucky to work in a region that pays teachers very well. So my advice is look into teacher pay in your area. Here are some traits to consider: 1. Are you comfortable talking in front of people? And can you be entertaining doing it? That comes first because you need to project confidence for classroom management. Your life will be hell if you do not have classroom management skills. 2. Are you patient? Do you get annoyed when people keep asking you the same question? 3. You Are going to need to be an educator but also a social worker and caregiver. 4. Are you creative? You can find A LOT of lesson ideas online but you need to have some skill at making stuff up yourself. 5. Are you organized but equally ok throwing your plans out the window? You need to be flexible and read your audience. 6. Are you compassionate? What I have learned is the #1 thing parents care about is that they are child is happy at school. Remember, when you talk to parents you are talking to them about the most important thing (sorry no better word) in the life. Always start with the positive. 7. Do you like kids? I put this last because I do not really think its about liking kids. I think being a good teacher has more to do with being compassionate, caring and empathetic. If that is the type of person you are, then that is how you will treat your students. When you start teaching, you may work a year in kindergarten then a year in grade 8. Its more about your respectful treatment of others. Hope that helps.",teaching everyone personally love work teacher wish would chosen different path teach grade teacher thirteen year plan retiring teacher fifteen year agree comment working adequate pay would teacher yr standard living choice constantly worried paying bill cannot really happy anything lucky work region pay teacher well advice look teacher pay area trait consider comfortable talking front people entertaining come first need project confidence classroom management life hell classroom management skill patient get annoyed people keep asking question going need educator also social worker caregiver creative find lot lesson idea online need skill making stuff organized equally ok throwing plan window need flexible read audience compassionate learned thing parent care child happy remember talk parent talking important thing sorry better word life always start positive like kid put last really think liking kid think good teacher compassionate caring empathetic type person treat student start teaching may work year kindergarten year grade respectful treatment others hope help,love wish different thirteen fifteen agree adequate yr happy lucky advice teacher comfortable front annoyed social creative lesson stuff ok flexible read happy important positive last good empathetic treat student respectful

Ditto withholding recess for behavior- if you are struggling to do the right thing before recess, what is going to happen to the rest of your day if you are stuck inside while everybody else plays?

ElementaryTeachers,"I was in college about ten years ago so I Am sure a lot has changed since then and I cannot remember much about my elementary math course. The one thing that does stand out in my mind is learning a numeric system that is base five. Our numeric system is base ten, meaning that each place value is ten times more than the last (tens=onesx10, hundreds=tensx10, thousands=hundredsx10 and so on). In college we had to do problems that were in base 5. Essentially the only digits to exist in this system are 0,1,2,3,4. So each place value is now five times greater than the last.

ElementaryTeachers,Haha! I Am so glad I Am not the only one who has concerns about this stuff!!!,haha glad one concern stuff,
ElementaryTeachers,"3rd grade teacher here! I Have been teaching for 16 years, and my first year or two, this was a really normal feeling for me. The more you teach, the more confidence you will gain. Its ok to feel overwhelmed and unsure- it does not mean you have done anything wrong! So a couple pieces of advice to help you in the moment of feeling overwhelmed- 1. Its ok to not know the answer to a question a student asks- I Am always honest if I do not know and use that as a teaching moment. Wow, what a great question! I do not know the answer to that, does anyone else? or I Am going to look into that for you! 2. Its ok to make a mistake! Again, use it to teach students that EVERYONE makes mistakes, even grownups, so they know its ok when THEY make a mistake. 3. If you are by yourself and need a moment to collect your thoughts or just breathe, ask a question and have students turn and talk about it, or have them partner up and read through a passage of something. Once you have gathered yourself, bring the class back together for a discussion. Remember, you do not have to be perfect! Teachers are people, too. Looking back, I think a lot of my overwhelm in the beginning was a fear of not being enough. But as long as you are showing up prepared and present with your students, and you are willing to learn from your mistakes, you are doing just fine!! And it gets easier- I promise!",red grade teacher teaching year first year two really normal feeling teach confidence gain ok feel overwhelmed unsure mean done anything wrong couple piece advice help moment feeling overwhelmed ok know answer question student asks always honest know use teaching moment wow great question know answer anyone else going look ok make mistake use teach student everyone make mistake even grownup know ok make mistake need moment collect thought breathe ask question student turn talk partner read passage something gathered bring class back together discussion remember perfect teacher people looking back think lot overwhelm beginning fear enough long showing prepared present student willing learn mistake fine get easier promise,red normal ok overwhelmed unsure wrong couple know answer great ok ok need ask read bring perfect fear prepared present willing learn fine

ElementaryTeachers,"Same! Here Is the thing though, I literally went up to my math methods professor at the end of class one day and had to ask her if she would be willing to teach me how to divide. No one told me division was just repeated subtraction; they just kept saying it was the opposite of multiplication and that was taught as just memorizing facts. So here is the thing, I learned math again using curriculum books for 3rd and 4th grade. And, it finally made sense. In student teaching, my gifted group of second graders could figure out the problems faster than I could and sometimes I just had them show their thinking or explain how they got their answers and, Wow. What a great way to explain your thinking. Let Us move on to the next problem. Two years ago my position got switched a month into the school year and I was teaching math as a remedial math teacher to third and fourth. I hated it, but man, let me tell you, I can explain why you move the decimal points, where the random zero comes from when you multiply, and pretty much everything all K-4 math standards.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi!! I am a senior in Elementary Education and I had the EXACT same fear. Younger math? I was amazing at it! Higher levels? Nope. Could not do it. I was convinced it was going to absolutely break my educational career. The good news is that your education college should have classes you will go through that basically reteach you the math taught in elementary schools. Once you master them, you can teach them a lot easier. My college had us go through two math classes that did this. We re-learned the concepts using simpler terms and did a couple practice problems. We had to solve the problems and explain every single step in written format, where a teacher would point out where our wording is confusing or identify where we went wrong. Our tests even had sections where we would identify where a imaginary student went wrong on a problem. These classes were extensive when it came to understanding the concept of mathematics, which made it way easier to explain.

Today's experience with some policy details: Drop off was a cluster this morning. Car rider line was 1.5mi long and growing when i got there. I do not envy those in decision making positions. So much pressure. It was slow, but effective. There were student volunteers walking kindergarteners to their classes. Someone the boy knows (a 5th grader) escorted him to his first day at big school. He was fine. The girl knew where she was going. 2nd grade! Staff were positioned to direct traffic just in case. The boy's class had lunch in their room. The girl dined picnic style. They sat siblings together on the bus. The girl reports that there were fewer passengers than last year. I leave work at 4:30 so they get off at an afterschool (daycare). Half of kindergarten attended today to get acclimated. The other half will go tomorrow, and they will have full classes Friday. Yesterday the Governor mandated that teachers and students are to wear masks at all times. Prior to that announcement they were able to take them off in the class room as long as they were spaced out, and don them any time they were unable to distance such as in common areas and whilst working in groups. The girl's classroom has clear partitions on each desk; Tiny, transparent cubicles in which they are able to free the face. Recess and PE were also bare faced. Classrooms will be fogged with some sort of disinfectant every evening. I am an environmental scientists. Our lab will begin COVID testing on surfaces in the next few weeks. Our testing will be limited to tribal organizations and schools on the reservation where I work, but I may do some ""training"" at my kids' school. We all survived day 1.

I grew up with a code word. I feel like that was something that really was reinforced by parents in the 90s and 2000s.

ElementaryTeachers,What may or may not have been conveyed in this post is that I suffer from moderately severe anxiety. Yesterday was bad. Both of my babies' teachers are friends of mine. I trust them fully. My issue with not being able to walk him was not the impetus for my fear that his experience will be effected.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I Am a teacher and am also head of English at a private school in England. We went back for three weeks before the summer break, and experienced socially-distanced school life in full throes of COVID fear. What is SO important to understand is that children are exceptionally malleable and care free. They do not have the fears we do, they do not go about their days whilst holding on to their anxieties about a global pandemic like us adults do. Of course, some children experience mental health conditions which would alter this, but for neuronormative children, their only anxieties will come from their parents. No, their experience will not be the same as other childrens in previous years, but that does not mean it will be any less special, or fun, or worthwhile. As cold as it may seem, not walking your child to their classroom on the first day will not change their experience of school, especially if you do not show any displeasure towards it. As a teacher, the hardest thing about teaching in this pandemic is knowing how to approach anxious and tentative parents. Please trust that your childrens schools will care for, love and act in the best interest of your child. Any experience in a school setting is better than none right now, and if your children are allowed to just breathe and enjoy their first day, you will see that it will not be as bad as you think!",hi teacher also head english private england went back three week summer break experienced socially distanced life full three couid fear important understand child exceptionally malleable care free fear go day whilst holding anxiety global pandemic like u adult course child experience mental health condition would alter neuronormative child anxiety come parent experience childrens previous year mean le special fun worthwhile cold may seem walking child classroom first day change experience especially show displeasure towards teacher hardest thing teaching pandemic knowing approach anxious tentative parent please trust childrens school care love act best interest child experience setting better none right child allowed breathe enjoy first day see bad think,english private distanced full important malleable free global u mental neuronormative come previous special first show hardest pandemic anxious tentative best better right breathe bad
ElementaryTeachers,"I am sorry you are in this position; it absolutely sucks. Your son's test came back negative - what a relief! However, he probably does have a different bug (like a cold) and I would wait a few more days before bringing him to school because you do not want other parents to have that same level of panic when their child has a fever. Your kids probably will not recognize their teachers. I went in with my mask to clean out my classroom in March and the essential workers' children did not recognize me and I have been one of their teachers for three years. That is okay. They will learn to recognize their teacher with a mask on as time continues. It will be weird and silly when they see their teacher without a mask on for the first time. Your child will not be kidnapped at school. You, and other adults, are not allowed in the building to even walk your kids to their classroom. Reassurance and comfort will be tricky, but teachers, school social workers and psychologists have been trying to figure this out for a while now and they will be able to manage it. They will not comply with the mandate. I think that is unreasonable to expect from a kindergartener as you well know. But, teachers and parents will reinforce proper mask etiquette and it will get better in time. Teachers work incredibly hard so that voices are heard. Turn and talk routines and other conversation pieces will probably be cut out to limit transmission, wetting of masks, and frustration in having to wear them. If your child needs something, a teacher will listen to their needs. They will understand them. Speech therapists are so good at what they do. It will be hard to see how to form your mouth to make the proper sound, but they will make it work. In my state, we have been told teachers can wear face shields (which do not really do much to limit spreading the virus) to allow students to see faces. It seems like this would be a scenario where maybe that is capitalized on. Your son will only feel negative about this experience if you make it feel like it is a negative - if you compare it to what it should be like. I would try to just be as supportive as possible and maintain positivity in ""You get to go to school! I am so proud of you! I cannot wait to hear all about what you learned today!"" You got this! Teachers are prepared to figure this all out and to support your children. I hope they have a great first day tomorrow and I hope you can update us about how it went!",sorry position absolutely suck son test came back negative relief however probably different bug like cold would wait day bringing want parent level panic child fever kid probably recognize teacher went mask clean classroom march essential worker child recognize one teacher three year okay learn recognize teacher mask time continues weird silly see teacher without mask first time child kidnapped adult allowed building even walk kid classroom reassurance comfort tricky teacher social worker psychologist trying figure able manage comply mandate think unreasonable expect kindergartener well know teacher parent reinforce proper mask etiquette get better time teacher work incredibly hard voice heard turn talk routine conversation piece probably cut limit transmission wetting mask frustration wear child need something teacher listen need understand speech therapist good hard see form mouth make proper sound make work state told teacher wear face shield really much limit spreading virus allow student see face seems like would scenario maybe capitalized son feel negative experience make feel like negative compare like would try supportive possible maintain positivity get go proud cannot wait hear learned today got teacher prepared figure support child hope great first day tomorrow hope update u went,sorry suck son negative different want panic mask clean essential weird first social able mandate unreasonable parent proper better teacher hard talk routine limit child listen understand good hard proper much allow capitalized negative negative supportive possible proud prepared great first update u

ElementaryTeachers,"I used Google Classroom. I assigned many things through it using Slides as I am able to embed videos and make interactive worksheets. When we did it though we assigned essentially day's worth of work over 5 day. I posted a suggested schedule to families through our class blog and shared the same schedule within Classroom. I offered regular video chats at the same times each week so families can easily schedule around them. (Mon - optional: check in and class chat, Tues - number talks, Wed-MysteryDoug, Thurs- Lit Circle book talks, Fri- Fun Friday). This might not work if you are expected to be teaching like you were if you were at school. Depending your grade level search FB for groups based on your area and grade level.

ElementaryTeachers,"The only one of the 3 you listed I am familiar with is RAZ-kids. It is more for primary and the interface is really for that audience. If kids have a compatible device they have access to the leveled books where you can set the level and they can read within the range. It has quizzes and you can assign benchmark books where they record them selves reading (if they have a microphone) and you can doing a running record. I do not find the books to be high quality (I prefer F&amp;P, Oxford or PM books for leveled reading material.) For intermediates (grade 4/5) we ran a lit circle online and assigned books through Epic (free) and Tumblebooks (school subscription) and focused on writing summaries and analyzing quotes and hosted weekly book talks in their group. Another supplement we used was ReadTheory which provides passages based on how the answer comprehension questions. But I would use it as such a supplement and not the main program.

ElementaryTeachers,"Not sure if this is what you need, but this was my idea: During school I reward students for extra reading in class. I give them little reading log bookmarks that act as punch cards. If they can tell me the title and topic of the book and provide their opinion of it, they get a stamp. If they fill their bookmark with 5 stamps, they get to pick a prize from the treasure chest. For distance learning, were using Canvas. I Am copying this system by creating an assignment. Students will upload a video of themself saying the title, topic, and their opinion of the book. Students are able to resubmit for each book they read and when they submit 5, Ill give them a digital reward, like choosing a gonoodle or game during our designated social zoom. I think you could do something similar on Google?",sure need idea reward student extra reading class give little reading log bookmark act punch card tell title topic book provide opinion get stamp fill bookmark stamp get pick prize treasure chest distance learning using canvas copying system creating assignment student upload video themself saying title topic opinion book student able resubmit book read submit ill give digital reward like choosing noodle game designated social zoom think could something similar google,sure extra little punch pick assignment upload title topic able ill give digital noodle social similar
ElementaryTeachers,"I usually like to have 2 projects planned at a time for each class. For example, if I am teaching a 1st grade drawing lesson, I will start planning the next lesson (painting, collage, etc) as soon as I begin teaching. It is too much work to plan things further in advance unless you start while you have time over the summer. As a first year teacher, you will have A LOT of work this year. It will feel overwhelming, but that is normal. It gets easier each year as you add more lesson plans and resources to your tool kit. With this year starting out a bit different, I suggest making lessons that can be easily adapted to go back into the classroom setting. Last Spring, we were posting asynchronous lessons each week and teaching 1 class/day synchronously. Specialists were require to help classroom teachers co-teach, and that allowed us to work together to help figure out the applications and monitor the chat. My county was using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra for synchronous teaching lessons, and we were asked to use Blackboard at my school. We finally got approval for Google Classroom (which I was using with my students before distance learning), so I am very happy to go back to that switch. If you purchase the Future Self drawing lesson, you will see step by step instructions and suggestions for how you can use Padlet ($10/month --- my school pays for accounts but you get 3 free Padlets at a time if you want to try it first), Google Classroom, and the presentation with the students. I have found these virtual rooms to be the best way to organize everything and help the students. My main suggestions for planning... * Think about your population of students, the curriculum, and their interests and plan from there. If I have a bunch of 2nd graders that love animals and are learning about habitats in their homeroom, how can I create a fun art project that incorporates my art standards and is engaging for the students? I could show students lots of pictures of different types of habitats and animals as inspiration and have them ""discover"" a new animal. What type of features would the creature have to survive in the environment? I would have them create the creature, give it a name, and then draw/collage/paint/sculpt the habitat, thinking about the animals needs. At the end, it is smart to give the students opportunities to reflect on what they would have done differently or have a mini critique and talk about ""glows"" for their classmates. * Spend the time to see how your lessons will work. If you do not feel comfortable teaching something live, record a video or create a step-by-step presentation with pictures you take along the way. I have noticed that having the step-by-step pictures either way is a huge help for students whose internet is not the greatest. If you put these pictures into a presentation or ""printable"" worksheet, you can use them as a teaching tool when you return to the classroom. * Look on Pinterest, Teachers Pay Teachers, and Instagram for ideas. You do not have to purchase anything, but this will at least give you some starting points for some lessons if you are stuck. * Remember that you are AWESOME and whatever you do will be exciting for the students! Focus on building student relationships at the beginning of the year. It is okay to have virtual ""lunch bunches"" with students that need some extra support, but remember to only commit to time you are comfortable with. * Keep a routine when you teach your lessons that will translate over to the classroom. For example, you could have a quick review of class expectations (1 min), review of the learning target or lesson for the day, demonstration or inspiration, studio, clean up, reflect (easy as thumbs up, sideways, or thumbs down or rating how successful the students feel on a scale from 1 - 5 ---- This let us you know who you need to check in with the following week). That is all I can think of right now, but if you have more specific questions, do not hesitate to ask.",usually like project planned time class example teaching it grade drawing lesson start planning next lesson painting collage etc soon begin teaching much work plan thing advance unless start time summer first year teacher lot work year feel overwhelming normal get easier year add lesson plan resource tool kit year starting bit different suggest making lesson easily adapted go back classroom setting last spring posting asynchronous lesson week teaching class day synchronous specialist require help classroom teacher co teach allowed u work together help figure application monitor chat county using blackboard collaborate ultra synchronous teaching lesson asked use blackboard finally got approval google classroom using student distance learning happy go back switch purchase future self drawing lesson see step step instruction suggestion use pallet month pay account get free pallets time want try first google classroom presentation student found virtual room best way organize everything help student main suggestion planning think population student curriculum interest plan bunch and grader love animal learning habitat homeroom create fun art project incorporates art standard engaging student could show student lot picture different type habitat animal inspiration discover new animal type feature would creature survive environment would create creature give name draw collage paint sculpt habitat thinking animal need end smart give student opportunity reflect would done differently mini critique talk glow classmate spend time see lesson work feel comfortable teaching something live record video create step step presentation picture take along way noticed step step picture either way huge help student whose internet greatest put picture presentation printable worksheet use teaching tool return classroom look pinterest teacher pay teacher instagram idea purchase anything least give starting point lesson stuck remember awesome whatever exciting student focus building student relationship beginning year okay virtual lunch bunch student need extra support remember commit time comfortable keep routine teach lesson translate classroom example could quick review class expectation min review learning target lesson day demonstration inspiration studio clean reflect easy thumb sideways thumb rating successful student feel scale let u know need check following week think right specific question hesitate ask,lesson next much start normal easier different lesson last asynchronous synchronous teacher u help blackboard ultra synchronous blackboard happy switch lesson see step pallet free google virtual best main habitat fun standard different animal new animal survive give draw animal need smart give critique spend lesson comfortable live create step noticed step huge greatest printable tool give awesome exciting virtual extra comfortable routine lesson clean easy successful scale right specific

That Is what I Am doing. I Have worked in museums and been a substitute teacher, and entered a certificate program at a local university to do the Ed classes I needed. In February I got hired to teach elementary art full time. I Am finishing up the last classes I need in the next couple of semesters, at which point my 3 year provisional will convert to a 10 year full license. In my area, its hard to find good art teachers apparently, and my educational background and experience as a substitute helped me qualify for the positions I applied for. Just make sure you have a really firm grasp on classroom management, because that is the one thing I Have felt makes a huge difference between being effective or frustrated as a new teacher, regardless of if you went to school for education or not.

ElementaryTeachers,"My favorite is Magic Playdoh (I teach 2nd). Its a ball of white Playdoh with a smaller ball of colored Playdoh hidden in the middle. Each child is given a baggie with the Playdoh inside and a note that says this attached: Magic Playdoh, oh so white / I wish I may, I wish I might / if a color should appear / its going to be a great school year! The kids roll and press and squish the Playdoh around and soon a color appearsI tell them to keep squishing until the white is mostly gone and the Playdoh is a new color. Then I have them make a sculpture of their favorite thing to play. There is so much excitement and its magical. It really helps to calm nerves and start the year off in a fun way. You can find it on TPT or Pinterest with recipes for salt dough and infusing the white dough with food coloring, but that just makes everyone is hands colorful. Frankly, I found it really easy and less time-consuming to buy Sargent Art Art Time Dough in white on Amazon. I buy 3 tubs and have more than enough for 30 kids with a ball about as big as their fists. Then I buy the small colored Playdoh containers (about 3 oz.) in the Target Dollar Spot or on Amazon. They work great and avoiding food coloring is a win! Another great activity for the first day (to help kids get to know each other or to start small groups) is the great STEM activity called Save Sam. Google it or find it on TPTits so fun!

I am a white mother of a first grader who loves talking about how his friends are ""the same and also different"" and our age-appropriate conversations are enlightening for both of us.

ElementaryTeachers,"Yard sales, the libraries have used book sales, and the hospital auxiliary in my town used to have a huge book sale every year.

Send home Scholastic flyers next year to start earning those bonus points, though I find their books are not made as well. They fall apart easily. Also, think about your book loaning system and how you will handle that. I found and started a digital library with an app to check out real books. However, it is awkward and not as fast as my little index card box with a little ""file"" for each kid. Every book has one of the old fashioned library book pockets with an index card with the book's title on it. No need for kids to sign the cards. They just hand them to you and you put the card in their little file (by student number so you only have to do it once). Then when they return, you retrieve the cards from their pocket, match it up to the books, and reshelve the books. You can train 2nd graders to put the cards back in their own books and it was a classroom job for 2 ""librarians"" to reshelve the books during book shopping time or the end of the day (all my books had labels clearly marking where they go.) Of course, Covid modified the way I did this this year, but it is still a good system. Whew...sorry that was so much. My classroom library is kind of a point of pride with me.

ElementaryTeachers,"To my knowledge, your master's degree likely does not have to have any type of licensure tied to it. It will, of course, mostly likely have to be an accredited program (but you knew that). If you were already employed, I would tell you to call your HR department and ask what kinds of master's programs they will accept for movement on the salary schedule. They would be able to tell you which ones would work and which would not. For example, my district states we can do whatever program we want, so long as it is accredited and the degree relates somewhat to our content. I teach elementary and I got my master's in educational technology, for example. I would assume one that would NOT work would be, say, a science teacher getting a master's degree in French Literature. As far as your worry about the licensure or endorsement, I would not worry about this. I have honestly never heard of such a thing. Just get your credential after your bachelor's and you will be fine as far as teaching goes. Then decide what master's you want to get. By that time, if you already have a job, then you can start asking around regarding specific degrees and programs.

ElementaryTeachers,"Agree with the above. I Have taught 1-5th grades. One year I went from teaching 4th to teaching 1st - reverse of what you are wanting. Agree about the sense of humor - and its very effective in relationship building with the students. They like to feel like you trust them with their learning. Show them you truly believe in them and they will far exceed their own expectations. Big difference between a 1st and 4th grader is they KNOW the difference. If you tell a 1st grader I know you can do it they will believe you even if you are just saying it. Fourth graders? Not a chance. They KNOW whether you believe it and they will call you out on it. In a nutshell: 1. Above all else, foster trusting relationships with the students - this will help with classroom management- because they will start to push the boundaries. (1st graders love you no matter what, 4th graders. Are a little more discerning) 2. Give them some independence - they are ready for it. They Are also able to think more abstractly and critically which can make learning so fun! 3. Begin your year touting the importance of kindness - girl drama is real at this age 4. When it comes to what they really need and want, its not all that different from 1st graders - A safe environment, acceptance, sense of achievement, boundaries and love.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I taught second grade for a year and now 4th grade for 6 years. Academically, 4th graders are ready for more independence. Not TOTAL independence, but definitely less hovering. Most importantly, they are super 100% ready for more in-depth collaborative projects that the little guys could never pull off. In my room, we have book clubs, where each kid has a job and they read a chapter of the book together, on their own, without a teacher present (or, I mean, with the teacher across the room). Nobody can do their job without everybody else, so they have to hold each other accountable. We do something similar in math, where kids work on their own on a problem that is just a *little* too hard, then come together after a certain amount of time to see if they can figure out how to solve it. Socially, they are ready for more responsibility! I definitely push the how do you solve this problem? (Like...an argument with your friend) off on them more than I did in the little grades. Sometimes, if they do something foolish, I air them down and ask them what they think their consequence should be (depends on what they did, though). Fourth graders are also have a way better sense of humor than the little guys (they get way more jokes) so its easy to make everything funny and boom they are engaged.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hey there, &amp;#x200B; I am a 4th grade teacher. I had a 3rd grader and a 5th grader at home with me when we went remote. I am a good parent and a good teacher. My kids just rejected me as their teacher. We fought pretty regularly and they did not put in the same effort that I know they put in when they are in class. The student teacher relationship, especially at that age is still one where the student has the mindset that whatever their teacher says is the right thing to do and something that they need to follow to a T. 4th grade is a really important year for taking skills in 3rd grade and expanding them. In third grade you multiply, in 4th you multiply 4 digits by 1 and 2 digits by 2 digits. With regards to reading practice practice practice. Read everyday and it gets easier. You might really hate this but the Common Core Standards are a guide for what they should be learning during the year. Most people are pretty intimidated by / unknowledgeable about them. But what they generally break down to is a skill that a child should be able to do. For example. 4.nbt.b.4 Breaks down to 4th grade, Numbers in Base 10 (this is generally going to be how do you compute with number), B (honestly know idea why they differentiate b from a here), 4 - this is the fourth item on the list. 4.nbt.b.4 reads: Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm. .... All this means is that students can add and subtract the regular way.

ElementaryTeachers,"I have been in 4th for a few years and I really like it. Its an interesting grade because you have half the class still in the imagination based play world and the other half of the class interested in walking and talking and socializing. This can be hard for a lot of kids who quite literally see their friends walking away from them when they are not ready to move on. They will still work hard for you which is one of my favorite things about elementary kids. Even the ones that are struggling still give effort. They have not really had the hormones kick in yet which is nice. You may have a few who do by the end of the year but for the most part I think the bigger changes start to happen in the second half of 5th grade. They may present like they are understanding what you are talking about but things do need to be a bit more clear than you may first expect. This is a huge growing year just all around. I would not use too much sarcasm as they probably will not really get it. Have fun, its a great grade!",the year really like interesting grade half class still imagination based play world half class interested walking talking socializing hard lot kid quite literally see friend walking away ready move still work hard one favorite thing kid even one struggling still give effort really hormone kick yet nice may end year part think bigger change start happen second half the grade may present like understanding talking thing need bit clear may first expect huge growing year around would use much sarcasm probably really get fun great grade,grade interested hard friend ready favorite hormone nice bigger start second clear huge much fun great

It is being a mom when there is a need, a nurse when needed, a mandated reporter when needed. I fell absolutely in love with my students and how the light bulbs would go off when they understood something. The trouble makers, the nose pickers, the assholes.

ElementaryTeachers,"It is the first day of school, and the teacher does not know the kids in the class or what they are like. The seating is based on a lot of factors you do not know about, and we do not just seat students with behaviour challenges at the front of the class. We seat based off of **legally protected** IEPs, and if a child has an accomodation to be at the front or the back or away from reflective materials or windows, we abide by that. Even if kids had poor behaviour the year before, we do not like to label kids as ""bad"" first off because behaviour can change as they age or over the summer. Also, I strongly take issue to your statement ""the few kids that can excel"" because **all kids have potential** and it is not genetically determined that some will and some will not. While you are looking out for the best interests of your one child, the teacher is trying to create a positive learning environment for *all* 20-30 students in the class. This includes not labelling some as bad or unable to learn. The other thing we work on is teaching children to be assertive and manage their own social-emotional regulation in school. Your daughter may actually benefit from sitting next to a less-preferred seatmate and having some coaching on how to work on telling her peers if they are annoying her or being rude, especially as she gets older, and how to problem solve. Do not project your own experiences on your daughter, and do not forget that schools have changed massively.

ElementaryTeachers,"First, you should make sure your tests are in order, like the CBEST and CSETs. There are other ways to satisfy these requirements, but I found it easier just to take the tests rather than dig up my old SAT score and whatnot. No need to take any pre-teaching courses because each program requires different prerequisite courses. Then, you just look up schools in CA that have teaching credential programs. Choose a few that you like or have researched, then check when applications for the next instruction period are open. I suggest starting the application process as soon as you are able because different programs require different things such as prerequisite courses or certain certifications like CPR and livescan. Finally, stay on top of your email for updates, such as interviews or other materials you need to provide, and then hope for the best :) Best of luck!",first make sure test order like best sets way satisfy requirement found easier take test rather dig old sat score whatnot need take pre teaching course program requires different prerequisite course look school ca teaching credential program choose like researched check application next instruction period open suggest starting application process soon able different program require different thing prerequisite course certain certification like car lifespan finally stay top email update interview material need provide hope best best luck,sure best satisfy easier dig old pre different prerequisite credential next open able different different prerequisite certain top best

ElementaryTeachers,"1. What grade level do you teach and what standards are you using? 3rd, Utah Core. 2. What kinds of diverse learners are in your class this year? Huge spread. 5 nationalities, 4 languages spoken. Title 1. 3. How do you assess which students are diverse learners? Reading fluency scores, comprehension tests, computer based learning progress, direct one on one formative assessments. 4. How would you describe the health and wellness of your students? There are a few that are grossly overweight but most are fairly healthy. 5. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness at school? The school is where a lot of them get the most nutrition. And we create a pretty safe environment for them. I cannot point to anything negative about their time in school that would impact their health and wellness. 6. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness outside of school? Troubled home lives. Living in homeless shelters, out of cars, moving a lot. Not having the opportunity to practice english. 7. How do you, as the teacher, support the health and wellness of the students? Lead by example. Stay healthy. Talk about things that impact their health. Second Steps social and emotional program is good. 8. What activities do you incorporate to support your diverse learners?

ElementaryTeachers,"Do Not be afraid to take a centering moment in the middle of the class. For example, take some deep breaths before beginning a lesson or lecture. Once students begin independent work sit at your desk for a minute to collect yourself and take some more breaths before getting up and moving to check on and help students. Drink your comfort beverage of choice throughout the day (coffee, tea, water soda or a combination) even better if you put it in a cute cup or mug. Get the kids moving or transitioning through the block via brain breaks or group work or a gallery walk or anything. They would appreciate the break too and it gives you a break as well. If you are having disciplinary or management issues take a few breaths before addressing it to calm yourself and avoid over reacting or yelling or anything unproductive. And most of all keep things simple. its your first year you do not need every lesson and every class to be the most exciting engaging multi modal lesson they have ever seen every day. Build simple and consistent routines and soon you and your students will breeze through the blocks in both halves of the day.",afraid take centering moment class example take deep breath beginning lesson lecture student begin independent work sit desk minute collect take breath getting moving check help student drink comfort beverage choice throughout day coffee tea water soda combination even better put cute cup mug get kid moving transitioning block via brain break group work gallery walk anything would appreciate break give break well disciplinary management issue take breath addressing calm avoid reacting yelling anything unproductive keep thing simple first year need every lesson every class exciting engaging multi modal lesson ever seen every day build simple consistent routine soon student breeze block half day,afraid deep lesson lecture independent cute give disciplinary calm avoid unproductive keep first multi simple consistent routine

ElementaryTeachers,"&gt;1. What grade level do you teach and what standards are you using? I teach grade 2 and I use the British National Curriculum for Literacy, and the Australian Maths curriculum. For Social Studies/Science I use IPC. &gt;2. What kinds of diverse learners are in your class this year? One autistic student, two EAL learners, and one anxious student so far (from last year's assessment). We will see what else I have next week. A lot is caught in Grade 2. &gt;3. How do you assess which students are diverse learners? Data data data. I do a preliminary basic assessment in the first weeks with observation and tracking (looking for difficulties writing, listening, doing math, with behaviour, inconsistencies between subjects, sensory red flags, and following directions) and then I have a basic referral form that asks for more detail and examples. I also have a writing and math diagnostic assessment that is a hodgepodge. I have some OG materials for reading. I also talk to parents. &gt;4. How would you describe the health and wellness of your students? Good. They are generally higher SES as it is private schooling. Some are emotionally neglected to some degree. Most have poor diets (sugary snacks, all carbs). Some are not active enough. &gt;5. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness at school? Lack of consistency due to covid is the big one. &gt;6. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness outside of school? Lack of activity, sometimes poor parental engagement or the flip side, too much parental engagement. My students tend to lack independence and problem-solving skills. &gt;7. How do you, as the teacher, support the health and wellness of the students? We educate on SEL, diet, and incorporate movement in. We have a routine. &gt;8. What activities do you incorporate to support your diverse learners? Daily multiple movement breaks, routine, explicit SEL curriculum (Second Step), and lots of encouragement. &gt;9. What do you wish you had known and prepared for as a teacher of diverse learners? I really think education programs should do more on disabilities and how to accomodate and read/build an IEP. Less siloed specialities would be better - there is no reason a classroom teacher should not incorporate basic OT, SLP, etc.",it grade level teach standard using teach grade use british national curriculum literacy australian math curriculum social study science use ipc it kind diverse learner class year one autistic student two eal learner one anxious student far last year assessment see else next week lot caught grade it ass student diverse learner data data data preliminary basic assessment first week observation tracking looking difficulty writing listening math behaviour inconsistency subject sensory red flag following direction basic referral form asks detail example also writing math diagnostic assessment hodgepodge og material reading also talk parent it would describe health wellness student good generally higher i private schooling emotionally neglected degree poor diet sugary snack carbs active enough it negatively impact student health wellness lack consistency due couid big one it negatively impact student health wellness outside lack activity sometimes poor parental engagement flip side much parental engagement student tend lack independence problem solving skill it teacher support health wellness student educate sel diet incorporate movement routine it activity incorporate support diverse learner daily multiple movement break routine explicit sel curriculum second step lot encouragement it wish known prepared teacher diverse learner really think education program disability accomodate read build pep le silted speciality would better reason classroom teacher incorporate basic ot slip etc,standard british national australian social diverse autistic anxious last next ass preliminary basic subject red basic referral detail diagnostic wellness good higher i private degree poor diet sugary active impact due big impact outside poor parental flip much parental engagement educate diet incorporate incorporate daily multiple routine explicit second wish prepared build basic

ElementaryTeachers,"With the upper grades, I keep a binder called the ""Choices Book."" Students each have a numbered section to flip to for their personal log. They log ""glows"" and ""grows,"" so if an individual is sent to the log, others do not always know if it is a positive ""glow"" or a consequence (room to grow). The log includes date, what happened, and reward/consequence. If they need to work on something, like walking instead of running or respecting others, they take a colored ""choices ticket"" (1/4 sheet of paper with lines) and fill it out with what choice they made (bad behavior) and how they will work on making a better choice next time. Depending on the infraction, they may need a parent signature on their ticket. Since the students are responsible for their own logs, this is a great tool to have at conferences to show parents or SSP teams how the behavior in class is. When students get 3 glows, they get to choose from the prize box. For the lower grades, I like using Class Dojo. I do not show points to the whole class, but boy do kids respond when they hear the +1 sounds and the -1 sound. I like this free online program as I can use my phone or computer and update points from anywhere in the room. Center time, if they hear a good chime, they all smile and get focused and working.

ElementaryTeachers,"So in principle, I do agree. Being punitive rarely leads to wholesale change, and there are no doubt places where the consequence is disproportionate to the behaviour. The thing is though, that there is a middle ground between ""chewing gum"" and ""guns and drugs."" Chronic disruption, for instance. Vandalism. Racial or homophobic insults. In Ontario, any of these would be reasons to consider suspension, though mitigating factors should be considered. Plus, honestly, kids are sometimes suspended because the teacher and/or the rest of the class need a break.",principle agree punitive rarely lead wholesale change doubt place consequence disproportionate behaviour thing though ground chewing gum gun drug chronic disruption instance vandalism racial homophobic insult ontario would reason consider suspension though mitigating factor considered plus honestly kid sometimes suspended teacher rest class need break,punitive lead wholesale behaviour gum gun chronic racial

What Is the problem with that? Some teachers have treat jars or pool jars which encourage teamwork, some throw in a bit of friendly competition...

I was just saying that as a general statement. I believe, as part of a new way of approaching education, its not negative to see how far you can push education. It could be that the teacher felt the class, or maybe just a few of the children, could potentially handle this type of work. When my son was 7 the teacher just kept giving harder and harder assignments, in a fun manner, just see how high they could go. At first, i was apprehensive about it, but afterwards we realized how much more they can handle. I attribute that teacher to a lot of my sons early success in school. It helped him develop better study habits that were far beyond what i could have envisioned. I do see the concern or second guessing of such material. Also, i will add, the teacher could be doing this out of... spite, for a lack of a better word. In my opinion, if the teacher is just trying to push the limits, in a ""fun"" experimental way, its ok push for it.

Learners dialogues/discussions/exchanges with each other and teacher predominate, 2. Learners make connections from content to real-life experiences, 3. Learners are actually engaged in learning activity, 4. Learners collaborate with their peers to accomplish/complete projects, activities, tasks, and/or assignments. Active learning is more about the collaboration and engagement students take in the learning and less of the activity.

On one side, they wrote a digit (so 0 - 9, on on each card). On the other side, they wrote a 0. Then I asked them to make a number using the cards. To find the value of a digit, they flipped over every card that is not that digit and they can see the new number. So 37 What is the value of the 3? Flip over every card that is not the 3 and see the value. You flip the 7 to see the 0 on the other side. 30. If you ask for the value if the 7, when they flip the 3 they have 07, so they can see the value. After I did this, I would make a place value chart and they would write the zeros underneath instead of flipping cards.",taught third grade larger number two digit every kid index card one side wrote digit card side wrote asked make number using card find value digit flipped every card digit see new number value flip every card see value flip see side ask value flip see value would make place value chart would write zero underneath instead flipping card,taught third larger digit digit card card new side underneath
ElementaryTeachers,Physical props to show carry over and replacement can be really helpful. Mainly just understanding stuff like 9 ones + 7 ones = 16 ones but only one digit can occupy that space so we can say that 16 ones is the same as 1 ten (showing the physical stack being replaced by the 10 I find helps) and 6 ones to give only one digit in each place,physical prop show carry replacement really helpful mainly understanding stuff like one one one one digit occupy space say one ten showing physical stack replaced find help one give one digit place,physical helpful occupy ten physical find

ElementaryTeachers,"Just an update, I did confirm that to teach mainstream elementary we only need pass the PPR and EC-6 content. It is also encouraged to take the ESL supplemental if you plan to work in any location that has a high bilingual population. Regardless, I think it is good to have! Also, it is not required to be bilingual! At all. Texas in no way requires it for teachers (aside for the bilingual route I believe, which makes sense), it is really just a valley preference. In fact, the bilingual supplement and BTLPT is only required if you plan to teach in spanish and english. I have heard the btlpt is challenging for fluent speakers, and myself not being that great I chose to just do the mainstream route vs bilingual. If your spanish is good, I would totally encourage you take both! If you are interested I found a fb page that helps with the btlpt..I can add it here for you. The members are nice and share a lot of good tips for studying the material.

ElementaryTeachers,"Yes that totally makes sense! Thank you! I am unsure if it is just my region in south texas (RGV) but I heard that I needed the bilingual cert and just found out there is another test, BTLPT (for spanish).

ElementaryTeachers,"I have always been told you do NOT have to be bilingual to teach / be certified bilingual. For example, I Am bilingual BUT my second language is not Spanish so yes I Am a bilingual person who could get a cert in bilingual education but my second language is not super common in most areas of a Texas. I do not know if that helped at all. There is a big difference between the ESL cert and bilingual one though. We had a teacher who was bilingual and had the bilingual cert but did not have the ESL one (it was not mandatory at the time) and she was not allowed to have ESL kids. She had much smaller classroom sizes than the rest of the team (she had 18 and we were all pushing 22-24) but the years following our admin required all teachers to obtain the Esl cert.",always told bilingual teach certified bilingual example bilingual second language spanish yes bilingual person could get cert bilingual education second language super common area texas know helped big difference esl cert bilingual one though teacher bilingual bilingual cert esl one mandatory time allowed esl kid much smaller classroom size rest team pushing year following admin required teacher obtain esl cert,bilingual bilingual bilingual second spanish bilingual cert bilingual second super common big bilingual teacher bilingual bilingual mandatory smaller

Also that in [some] interviews you may have to be able to prove you are capable of spanish speaking.

AND YES, I have also heard that many school districts are now wanting teachers to be bilingual or ESL certified but I do not know if IT IS a requirement. I know of a few elementary teachers that have had a hard time passing these two tests and have not lost their jobs til this day. I would totally go for it though. It will make your application stand out and they will probably hire without questioning you too much in an interview.

ElementaryTeachers,"Coincidentally, I have a biology degree and teach elementary! Not sure how much it is changed since I got my multi-subject credential (aka elementary) 21 years ago, but the typical route is to get accepted to a credentialing program, usually through a university - I went through San Francisco State University. It can last anywhere from 1-2 years depending on the pace of the program. They are not difficult to get into but it does cost significant money for tuition and you will be a full time student so it is tough to work a regular job simultaneously. There are various academic theory tests you must pass plus student teaching before getting your credential. Keep in mind that despite all the credential classes and student teaching, you will NOT be prepared for the rigor, chaos, and insanity of being a teacher - not even close! In rare cases, you can find an internship and teach your own class while doing your credential classes at night which is NOT easy and is absolutely exhausting as you might imagine. You would teach all day then go to classes until late at night. With this route, at least you get paid while earning your credential although it is very low pay on an auxiliary pay scale lower than a first year teacher. If you have not already done so, I would STRONGLY getting your feet wet by substitute teaching first. While it is nowhere close to being an actual full time elementary teacher, it will give at least a small taste of what the job entails. It is also a good way to get your ""feet in the door"" of districts that you may want to work for in the future. With the pandemic, getting a credential right now is a huge unknown. I do not know how you could possibly get experience working in classrooms right now so you would have to talk to the credential program leaders.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, I am about to start my sixth year, I am going to do my best answering these questions. * Can you pick what grade you teach? * Not often, but administration does try to accommodate with what you are comfortable with because you will do a better job there. When you are student teaching, some programs let you request a grade level. Whatever grade you spend the most time working with can show your preference and can help placement between guide upper or lower grades when looking for a job. * How do you know what type of curriculum you must teach? Is there anything you are given that helps you teach the lesson? * The state or school system will provide the curriculum and often has a ton of resources. I work for a bigger county, and there is a TON of support. Making friends with coworkers is huge; it is certainly a team effort when someone is in their first year. Everyone feels like they are floundering, but you are not. You will get it and be amazing! Tip: When going on interview, as principals if they have a mentoring/new teacher committee. * What Is the best way to plan activities/lessons? * That is a bit of a broad question. Be sure that your lessons completely align to the standard being taught. I realized after two years that I had not understood the standards to the degree necessary to teach. Look at the standards, map out a schedule, create the unit test, and teach with the end goal in mind. \*Do not teach the test, but teach the curriculum thoroughly. * Are there other things I should do before applying for any teaching position that would help? * Jump into your student teaching with the mindset of being hands-on. I was shy the first year of mine, and I feel like I missed out on a lot of learning opportunities. * How do you find out about open teaching positions? * Go to the county or school systems websites and fill out applications. Also, drop off resumes to the schools you really want to work at in person. It is okay to talk to people you know in the system. * What is the interview process like? * It depends on the school. They will call you in and there is usually some administration and possibly some teachers. * What if I have to call out of work for an emergency or that I Am sick? What do I or the school do? * The school will go over all this information at new teacher orientation at the county and school.",hi start sixth year going best answering question pick grade teach often administration try accommodate comfortable better job student teaching program let request grade level whatever grade spend time working show preference help placement guide upper lower grade looking job know type curriculum must teach anything given help teach lesson state system provide curriculum often ton resource work bigger county ton support making friend coworkers huge certainly team effort someone first year everyone feel like floundering get amazing tip going interview principal mentoring new teacher committee best way plan activity lesson bit broad question sure lesson completely align standard taught realized two year understood standard degree necessary teach look standard map schedule create unit test teach end goal mind teach test teach curriculum thoroughly thing applying teaching position would help jump student teaching mindset hand shy first year mine feel like missed lot learning opportunity find open teaching position go county system website fill application also drop resume school really want work person okay talk people know system interview process like depends call usually administration possibly teacher call work emergency sick go information new teacher orientation county,hi sixth best comfortable better grade lower lesson bigger huge first amazing principal new teacher best lesson broad sure align standard necessary standard schedule thoroughly teaching first open website want okay call sick new

ElementaryTeachers,"Just my 2 cents: * When you do get an interview, I would suggest researching the school &amp; district history, student and family demographics for the school/district, and the district's educational philosophy in the days before the interview. It would also be helpful to know what reading/writing and math programs are used in the district and learn a bit about them before the interview if you are not already familiar. * I have been on multiple interview committees over the past 20 years and they have been held in various ways. Sometimes, it is a large group of principals and teachers in a large conference room at the district office. Other times it is just been at the school site in a small meeting room with just the principal and a few teachers. They will often ask you various questions from what makes an effective reading program to different behavioral scenarios and how you would handle them. There is usually between 10-15 questions. We have always end with ""Do you have any questions?"" so be prepared to ask questions as this part often tells more about a candidate than any of the other questions. * Right now it is a bit difficult with school closings but substituting is a great way to get to know a school and district as well as get your ""foot in the door"".

ElementaryTeachers,"- you will he hired for a specific grade level not just generally by the school so ideally you can pick the grade by applying to positions that you want. - Most schools have a curriculum for at least reading and math and they are different all over the Country but whatever curriculum it is, you follow basically what the books tells you to do. Most curriculums have extra supplies, workbooks, homework sheet, etc. - you cannot plan anything until you know what curriculum you would be using but joining Facebook groups, following teachers on insta, and looking on Teacherspayteacher.com is extremely helpful to find fun ways to teach your lessons. - For applying you will need you are resume and cover letter for each school you apply to. The cover letter should talk about the schools mission or anything that they represent, while also selling yourself. That means you have to change the cover letter a bit for each school. Make sure you do basic research on the schools website in case they ask you anything about it. - I use Applitrack.com, not sure how popular it is in CA but usually you can type in (school district #) applitrack and you can fill out an application. This website it cool bc it will autofill your info if you apply to more than one school on applitrack. - interviewing is different everywhere, sometimes its just questions, sometimes they will want you to teach a lesson in front of them or something like that so it depends on school district. - each school is different about subs. I formed relationships with a few so that I was able to text them if I needed someone last minute but usually you just call in and they will assign a sub or there is usually a website to just input that you arw sick and it looks for subs in the district.

ElementaryTeachers,"I am just finishing up my 1st year as a 1st grade teacher! I was expecting to teach upper el as well so it was a big adjustment. The biggest thing I Have noticed is that 1st grade is a huge jump from Kindergarten in expectations and so its a big adjustment. I only taught Math, Science, and Social Studies so I cannot speak to ELA. For math there will likely be a large range of students. I have students who could not count to 25 all the way up to students who could do basic double digit addition. The biggest thing is to build their basic number sense as a lot of students do not really understand numbers. I also got a lot of pressure to teach concepts like multiplication and division to challenge their students. Some parents do not understand that there is an appropriate sequence and that their 6 year old is not ready for multiplication just because they have memorized some multiplication facts. 1st grade was a lot of fun (I Am moving up to 5th next year) so I hope you enjoy it!",finishing it year it grade teacher expecting teach upper el well big adjustment biggest thing noticed it grade huge jump kindergarten expectation big adjustment taught math science social study cannot speak ela math likely large range student student could count way student could basic double digit addition biggest thing build basic number sense lot student really understand number also got lot pressure teach concept like multiplication division challenge student parent understand appropriate sequence year old ready multiplication memorized multiplication fact it grade lot fun moving the next year hope enjoy,upper big biggest huge big social speak large double digit biggest basic understand lot old ready next

ElementaryTeachers,"**Assess early and often and make referrals as needed for suspected learning or mental health disabilities - ask for support if you need it on spotting them. If they are not caught by grade 2 the damage to self esteem can be irreparable.** You will be doing a whole lot of literacy, which should ideally following a solid multisensory phonics-based approach with small group reading instruction built in in levelled grouos. You can support with sight words. Activities need to be kept short, light, and focused with lots of play built in and loads of repetition of the concept. You will likely use a levelled reading system but try not to focus overmuch on levels. Try to use decodable texts as much as possible. Read-alouds, think-alouds, modelled and shared writing, as well as independent reading and writing time are all important. You want to have a good balance. Keep an eye out for students who are having a hard time segmenting words into sounds and use a lot of visuals to support. You will spend most of the rest of the instructional time on maths. Again, lots of repetition, lots of physical manipulatives, lots of play-based learning if you can, and try to look into open-ended maths tasks with low floors and high ceilings. Number talks are great for this. If your school supports it, I would recommend trying to incorporate guided or small-group maths as well with levelled groups. Doubles and skip counting through games are great too. Start to give them choice as much as possible. You will need a solid solid solid daily routine (I like to start with morning meeting and calendar to drive home a literacy and maths approach, songs and poems, and a daily SEL focus. The Mojo videos are like 2-3 minutes long and the kids love them!) Then you will shoehorn in art, music, and PE, depending on how your specials break down. You might get a little science or social studies but really, you will have to use maths or literacy to get most of that in. Your big thing is ROUTINES. Expect to spend a week teaching them routines at the beginning of the year. Do not even bother with academics much. The kids need to know where to sit, where to put their things, how to sit, how to go to the bathroom, when is snack, how to wait, where to get pencils, how to transition, how to quiet down, how to ask for help, how to be independent in these routines, and how to walk in a damn line. (They will not do this.) I am serious - we practiced at least 2x a week, and I teach grade 2! Kids love incentives - fill a jar with pompoms for a choice activity, or do a chart indicating growth and give stickers. I also do laminated paper strips for rewards - get ten and you can trade them in for sitting with a buddy during snack, or save to 20 to trade for a small prize. Save 50 for a big prize. Etc. Expect to reteach these routines CONSTANTLY through the year. After each break. Daily. Be gentle and kind but firm. Additional things to watch for this year and embed into the beginning: fine motor and pencil grasp. Video your kids' hands and really look at their grasp. For students with poor FM skills try to refer or remediate as much as possible early on. If you have an OT on staff or available have them set up some activities for the kids to do in down time or incorporate them into guided groups. Gross motor: use movement activities to strengthen midline crossing and core strength. Go Noodles are great. Body breaks are the best. Alternative seating is the bomb. Finally, always end the day on a good note. Story time, telling (bad) jokes, an award or praise once everyone is organized is such a great way to finish up the day. For you, borrowing and tweaking routines from a teacher with experience will work best. Send a positive note home or call home to every single student in the first week. For classroom management, positive praise works best. Call out good behaviours every time you see them. Have fun! Grade 1s are still basically little walking egos who want to share their excitement with everyone and who start to really blossom with empathy and awareness as the year goes on.",ass early often make referral needed suspected learning mental health disability ask support need spotting caught grade damage self esteem irreparable whole lot literacy ideally following solid multisensory phonics based approach small group reading instruction built levelled groups support sight word activity need kept short light focused lot play built load repetition concept likely use levelled reading system try focus overmuch level try use recordable text much possible read clouds think clouds modelled shared writing well independent reading writing time important want good balance keep eye student hard time fermenting word sound use lot visuals support spend rest instructional time math lot repetition lot physical manipulative lot play based learning try look open ended math task low floor ceiling number talk great support would recommend trying incorporate guided small group math well levelled group double skip counting game great start give choice much possible need solid solid solid daily routine like start morning meeting calendar drive home literacy math approach song poem daily sel focus mojo video like minute long kid love shoehorn art music pe depending special break might get little science social study really use math literacy get big thing routine expect spend week teaching routine beginning year even bother academic much kid need know sit put thing sit go bathroom snack wait get pencil transition quiet ask help independent routine walk damn line serious practiced least i week teach grade kid love incentive fill jar pompoms choice activity chart indicating growth give sticker also laminated paper strip reward get ten trade sitting buddy snack save trade small prize save big prize etc expect reteach routine constantly year break daily gentle kind firm additional thing watch year embed beginning fine motor pencil grasp video kid hand really look grasp student poor am skill try refer remediate much possible early ot staff available set activity kid time incorporate guided group gross motor use movement activity strengthen midline crossing core strength go noodle great body break best alternative seating bomb finally always end day good note story time telling bad joke award praise everyone organized great way finish day borrowing tweaking routine teacher experience work best send positive note home call home every single student first week classroom management positive praise work best call good behaviour every time see fun grade still basically little walking ego want share excitement everyone start really blossom empathy awareness year go,referral mental grade irreparable whole solid small short load overmuch recordable much possible independent important good hard rest instructional physical try open low great small double great possible solid solid solid daily poem daily kid shoehorn special little social use big academic much pencil quiet independent routine serious least i buddy small big break daily gentle additional fine grasp poor skill remediate much possible early ot available gross noodle great alternative good bad great finish routine best send positive single positive good little blossom

You need a growth mindset and be okay with constant PD, often self-administered rather than provided by your school. You need to be open to trying new things, always. I have worked with plenty of teachers who look at a method that is proven effective and say ""Well that is just not my style"".... that is not the right mindset to have in this career. Also, if you want a homey and well-furnished classroom, you need to be willing to invest your own $$ if your school/district does not provide funding for that (most do not). I see tons of teachers complain about spending their money on their rooms but I mean, no one made them, and it is common knowledge -- we all go into this career ***knowing*** that funding usually is not provided and that most teachers fund their own classrooms. If you are not cool with that, do not go into this career, or at least try to get into a district that DOES pay but be aware that, again, most do not.",one go teaching pay said plenty state pay livable salary obviously want avoid state known abysmal pay live one state need open relocating teaching incredibly rewarding job really committed passionate quickly burnt need growth mindset okay constant ad often self administered rather provided need open trying new thing always worked plenty teacher look method proven effective say well style right mindset career also want homey well furnished classroom need willing invest district provide funding see ton teacher complain spending money room mean one made common knowledge go career knowing funding usually provided teacher fund classroom cool go career least try get district pay aware,plenty livable salary avoid abysmal open committed need okay constant administered new plenty proven effective right furnished willing teacher common least aware
ElementaryTeachers,"The only times I feel poor is when I want something for my classroom and realize I cannot buy 25 of these!! Sometimes I wonder if I got paid more, what that would mean for my students. Theater will definitely help. A lot of my teaching is working on emotional regulation and empathy (really working on recognizing how someone else is feeling.) Yoga will help to - kids love doing yoga. We do it for stretching breaks frequently or as a buffer between snack/indoor recess and switching our brains and bodies back to learning. If you feel like its something you want to do, do it! There are also a lot of pathways to becoming a teacher (TFA) and licensing options so depending on where you are in your studies, it might be good to check those out.",time feel poor want something classroom realize cannot buy sometimes wonder got paid would mean student theater definitely help lot teaching working emotional regulation empathy really working recognizing someone else feeling yoga help kid love yoga stretching break frequently buffer snack indoor recess switching brain body back learning feel like something want also lot pathway becoming teacher tea licensing option depending study might good check,poor emotional snack tea

ElementaryTeachers,"I Am now entering my 5th year of classroom teaching and making 50k this school year. I started at 38k, and before that I was working at a nonprofit teaching in different schools every week for 25k. I will not ever say that I Am still doing teaching because of the money, but on hard days, its a thought that crosses my mind. I usually work around 65 hours a week and its exhausting. Now that I Am in my 5th year, I think I will have a better handle on work-life balance, but also last year my role changed halfway through and I spent the entire school year teaching from home. I could not even try to leave work at work. I tell friends my dream job is a job where I sit at a desk - maybe in a cubicle - and answer phone calls, write emails, and occasionally clean out the microwave and then go home. Id suggest finding a administrative job for now - I Am sure your interviews have gone well - and then decide what you want to do. You could also apply for some paraprofessional jobs at schools - or even look to see about some administrative jobs at schools. After a year or two, I Am sure you will have a better idea of what you want. I think you should also try to reframe I Am not doing what I Am meant to do because that does not seem healthy. Maybe what do you feel like you are meant to do? Why?

ElementaryTeachers,"So many positivesyou love the kids, your admin says you are good and they are happy with your work, you have an amazing mentor teacher who helps you out so much, and you love your colleagues. Could it be that your expectations are too high? Every child will not end their year with you excited about Reading and Writing and doing it successfully. How are you measuring success? You say you spend hours trying to plan effective lessons to make sure ALL of my students get equal opportunity to learn the skills. Move away from the word all. Its simply not going to happen. For hundreds of reasons, even the best, most experienced teachers with engaging, effective plans will not reach every student. Its not because they failed. Its because too many other things affect learninghome life, cognitive skills, whether a child had a good breakfast...you just cannot solve every problem. So please try to relax, and lower your expectations for yourself and the kids. Focus on all the positivesyou are so lucky to have them. Cut the hours of planning. Measure your success differentlyare most of the kids engaged and learning? Good! That Is enough. Remember, you may never know the effects you may be having on a child. They may not show any success in your class at the time, but maybe years later they will say you were their favorite teacher, and you are the reason they love Reading. And the biggest reason of all to just sit back and not make any sudden changes when it sounds like you are a wonderful teacher...your teaching career started and continues during the most abnormal, difficult and unprecedented time ever in the lives of your students, their parents, and you.

And we cannot pay teachers unless we have students enrolled. In my district, teacher cuts for low enrollment happen in the Spring. So if you are offered a contract now, and the students withdraw/disenroll, they still have you under contract and have to pay you/find a place for you to work. But it IS possible that we are already over-staffed... School here does not start until September, so my best guess is hiring frenzy in August. There is also substitute teaching as a way to get your foot in the door. But we both know that is no benefits and not a living wage. Last year we did remote than hybrid. Parents are not going to go for that again. And you have both camps: parents who do not want them face to face because of the varient, parents who will send their kids to schoolbut not with a mask and some parents who will only send their kids if they all wear masks. The ONLY teachers I have heard of getting jobs are in Special Education. So we wait. Hope the Delta/Lambda Greek alphabet of COVID goes away and schools can open so teachers can teach.

ElementaryTeachers,"I organized my books in Fiction in half grade level steps using ATOS method (find this to be most suitable for my first and second graders) ex: 0.5-1.0 1.0-1.5 etc. For Non-Ficiton, I sorted based on genre sticker as well as ATOS level. For my labels, I used Avery Labels with color code with each level or genre. Certain collections or series that were popular (MTH, ...Black Lagoon etc) also gained a bin or container. For your set up and library, I would suggest tubs to go into the cubes. If you have an IKEA, look at Billy bookshelves or Home Depot online for three-four shelf ones. Sourcing books: Scholastic Book Club, Half Price Books, Library resale, and First Book Marketplace (if you are Title 1 teacher). Best of luck.

ElementaryTeachers,"I teach first grade as well. For years past we have used Lucy Caulkins so my library was leveled. I had separate bins for levels A-M, some of the more popular levels had 2 bins. Then I color coded the bins and told students what color they could pick from. So like levels A-D was one color, then E-G, then H-L was another color. So students could still pick a range of book levels, but closer to their level as well. I also had 2 bins of multi level fiction books (majority of these books were L level or higher) and 1 bin of multi level nonfiction books, then a bin of alphabet books. I called these dessert books. Students could pick out 5 books a week, but a max of 2 dessert books. My library consisted of 4 half sized bookcases. This year our county is switching to Science of Reading and they do not like leveled libraries so my library will be changing. I would suggest speaking to your team members if you should do leveled vs unleveled library. It goes with the curriculum you are teaching. Good luck",teach first grade well year past used lucy caulking library leveled separate bin level popular level bin color coded bin told student color could pick like level one color e i i i another color student could still pick range book level closer level well also bin multi level fiction book majority book i level higher bin multi level nonfiction book bin alphabet book called dessert book student could pick book week max dessert book library consisted half sized bookcase year county switching science reading like leveled library library changing would suggest speaking team member leveled i leveled library go curriculum teaching good luck,library separate popular closer level higher dessert sized leveled library team library curriculum good
ElementaryTeachers,"Yes!! When I first chose my major and was telling people what I was going to school for, all of my high school friends were like ""okay... Well what else are you going to study?"" Because apparently elementary education in and of itself just is not worthwhile and is an easy degree.

ElementaryTeachers,"Our school district uses Lucy Caulkins Reading and Writing Workshop so our classroom libraries are leveled for the most part using the Fountas and Pinnell reading levels. I teach fourth grade and organize my library into two main sections: fiction and non-fiction. Books are put into plastic bins/baskets with the reading levels on the outside for fiction and by subject for non-fiction books then put on book shelves. I keep my picture books in separate, larger baskets. It was tedious but each book has its reading level labelled on the back with a sharpie. I have also labelled each book with my classroom name and whether its fiction or non-fiction using return printed address labels stuck to the bottom back of each book. I have some dedicated fiction baskets for popular series instead of reading level such as Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I Survived, Sports stories, comics/anime, Fantasy, etc. My non-fiction is by subject such as History, Animals, STEM, Sports, etc. Hope that helps and good luck!",district us lucy caulking reading writing workshop classroom library leveled part using counts pinned reading level teach fourth grade organize library two main section fiction non fiction book put plastic bin basket reading level outside fiction subject non fiction book put book shelf keep picture book separate larger basket tedious book reading level labelled back sharpie also labelled book classroom name whether fiction non fiction using return printed address label stuck bottom back book dedicated fiction basket popular series instead reading level diary wimpy kid survived sport story comic anime fantasy etc non fiction subject history animal stem sport etc hope help good luck,fourth library main plastic subject non separate larger tedious address label popular diary sport comic non subject animal good

And then you need to follow through with that. This will get the kids to start quieting each other down. That is what you want. You want them to learn to control themselves. Before writing this on the board, I would call EVERY parent in that class. Introduce yourself. Tell them a little bit about yourself and say something nice about their kid. Explain how important your subject is to their kid's future. For the parents whose kids are behaving, start by apologizing and explaining how important it is that you be able to teach the lesson. They will probably support you. For the parents whose kids are not behaving, ask them to come and observe the class. They probably will not be able to. Explain that their student is being disruptive and you are unable to teach your lesson. Explain that if you cannot teach the lesson during school time, then you will have to teach it after school. Ask the parent to talk to their child. Oh yeah, one more thing. Some smart alec is going to come in the next day and say ""my mom does not like you."" I usually say, ""my mom does not like you either, but I do."" I would also buy the Wong books. I found one of them used on Amazon for $5. I bought it. There were more available. Good luck!

The first lesson was great; the ones that followed not so much. It kind of ruined my hobby. First of all, the kids that do not care about grades do not care about grades. I would suggest making the elective pass/fail. I would also suggest you ask students what they want to do. They are going to make all sorts of suggestions, including stuff like watching Fortnite videos. I would suggest you try incorporating their suggestions into a dynamic class that does something different every week. Maybe one week you DO watch Fortnight videos and then ask the kids to write what moves they learned that will help them the most. It would also be a good opportunity to talk about gaming addiction, and a discussion about how much time is appropriate to spend on gaming. I would not reject any suggestion a kid makes.

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"To start: I just want to say that I do not believe in punishments, but in consequences. And a response to a problem behavior only qualifies as a consequence (and not a punishment) when the child is able to learn from their mistake through the consequence. Kids are rarely able to learn through a suspension, and In my opinion, suspension is only appropriate if the child needs to be removed from school because there is a belief that the child will harm another student. Your son chose to respond to the incident in a way that escalated it from verbal, to physical. He had other options and chose to physically retaliate. The girl may have started it, but now he has chosen to not only engage with her, but also to escalate. What would he do if she tripped him in retaliate? Where does it stop? The reality of our public school system is that there is a no tolerance policy towards physical violence. I Am not a fan of suspension in general, but I also understand that public schools have to take a zero tolerance approach to physical violence. He needs to learn now that getting physical is never a way to respond to verbal assault. I would take this as an opportunity to teach him alternate ways to handle his anger. It sucks that he was suspended, but it is also reasonable that he was. What would have happened if she is hit her head when she tripped? Would it be ok if he was suspended then? I am not assuming that this is his typical behavior. And please do not take this as me saying that I think he was 100% in the wrong and deserves to be punished for it. Hes a kid and hes learning how to deal with his feelings, and with conflict. He made a poor choice, and now hes having to deal with the consequences of that choice. The punishment may seem severe, but hopefully he will be able to learn from it and going forward have a better ability to respond to bullying. Tell a teacher, ignore it, walk away, talk to you about it... there are so many other options than physically trying to hurt the person who is verbally hurting him. And that is what tripping a person is - its an attempt to because them to fall and hurt themselves. To be clear, I think the girl making fun of also should be taught how not to be a turd. And I hope her actions were also addressed.

Perhaps no one listens to him, and the only attention he gets at home is attention after hes behaved the way your describing?

How do you think he might respond, if you spend some time talking one-on-one with him, fighting outlet what it is that is bothering him, and addressing the simple things.

A week later, after we covered some specific writing rules, we spiral back to text structure, but this time we are focused on compare and contrast and they have to write two paragraphs comparing in one and contrasting in the other using the specific writing skill we focused on. Next week we are learning about connotation and denotation and comparing two poems. We will have another writing skill to focus on that is added to the one we disused on earlier.

Not quite as fancy as most interactive notebooks, but they still involve student engagement and work better at covering information than our old, dense textbooks. We give them fill-in-the blank notes to following along in class during direct instruction (for math I recommend Maneuvering the Middle). These notes include the new info, some example problems to solve as a group, and some individual practice. Between instruction and giving an assignment, I give them time to glue their notes in. You can also use these notebooks for warm-up problems (our science teacher does this) and review/study materials (our ELA teacher does this for vocab quizzes). Our social studies teacher collects notebooks every week (when they do not have homework they could need them for) and grades them based on how complete the notes are, if they are in the right order, and if no materials are missing.

MiddleSchoolTeacher,I know it probably hurts when kids say stupid things like that. I learned several years ago to try and not take what these little angels say personally. They lash out the only way they know how. Most of the time they have horrible home lives. I know this does not make it any better but I have been going home much less stressed over what kids say and do to try and get at me personally when I just let it roll off. Now I Am not saying I do not do anything about it. I would pull any and all kids that sit in that spot and try and figure out who is the culprit. I would document the behavior. Call the dean. Call parents. If the behavior continues then ask to have the child removed from my room. You do not need to go through the day being stressed. Good luck,know probably hurt kid say stupid thing like learned several year ago try take little angel say personally lash way know time horrible home life know make better going home much le stressed kid say try get personally let roll saying anything would pull kid sit spot try figure culprit would document behavior call dean call parent behavior continues ask child removed room need go day stressed good luck,stupid several little lash know horrible better le stressed call good

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"If you do not already, maybe put a reward system in your class! And have it publicly displayed so kids always know where they stand. Some reward systems I have: A ticket raffle! Every time I catch a student doing something good, they get a ticket which they write their name on and put in a jar. At the end of every week, I pull a ticket from the jar and kids get the option between a dollar box of candy from Walmart or a homework pass. SILENT on the board: For every time I have to tell a class to be quiet, I write a letter of SILENT on the board. If they spell out the entire word, they have silent lunch for the rest of the week (or Monday / Tuesday if they finished the word on a Friday). Students have the opportunity to remove a letter for every ten minutes of silence. This has always encouraged students to be quiet when I ask and students HATE silent lunch so they get onto their peers about staying on track and being quiet (which takes a lot of work off of me lol) Tea Time: Every Friday, I give my students 15 minutes of class time to just spill the tea on who is dating who, who is beefing with who, and all of that other stuff. It is interesting information because I can change seating charts or groups based on this information, let other teachers know, and especially for the beef keep an eye out for those students in hallways during class change. I have clear expectations that if we have had silent lunch or too many disruptions in a week we will not get tea time, and kids LOVE it so when I instituted this little program behavior in my classroom improved SO MUCH!

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"I think that is okay. I would not push it too far, as most of them are still in the beginning stages of formal cognitive reasoning in their brain development, but they likely are going to start questioning right from wrong, as well as more grey areas.

Ideas of what justice is, or freedom and autonomy vs. authority structures, independence, respect for self and for others, etc. Even having the characters finding healthy ways to communicate, especially difficult feelings like anger or embarrassment, can give them a foil for asking inward questions such as, how could that character have handled this situation better, and how would I react if that had happened to me, etc.",think okay would push far still beginning stage formal cognitive reasoning brain development likely going start questioning right wrong well grey area addressing issue fiction kid encounter real world help process larger societal problem idea justice freedom autonomy i authority structure independence respect self others etc even character finding healthy way communicate especially difficult feeling like anger embarrassment give foil asking inward question could character handled situation better would react happened etc,formal cognitive grey real larger societal i character healthy difficult inward

At my local community college, you have to take a test and pass certain benchmarks to be able to take classes there if you are under the typical college age (if you do not meet the benchmarks, they have lower level classes to help you get caught up).

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"I Am teaching hybrid. Its going really well, honestly. Its a lot of work - but my biggest advice is to treat them all like they are virtual kids and give them all the same assignments. You are one person doing one job. You cannot be expected to stay sane and teach face-to-face kids a different lesson then your virtual kids. I Have transitioned to a flipped classroom module. My instructions are prerecorded. Some that I found on YouTube, some that I recorded myself. After my kids watch the video - they complete independent practice problems. Each problem after they turn it in givens them feedback on what the correct answer was and how to solve it. (Most of the time just a picture of how to solve it). Then they take a 2-3 question quiz at the end to show me what they know. We do this every day, except Fridays when we play spiral review games. Usually Jeopardy. While my kids are working - I pull individuals to answer questions and to explain concepts they need help with. I also answer emails and reach out to my virtual kids. All of my lessons are standard specific, and include real world applications as much as possible I teach math. One thing I started the year wanting was pictures of student work. What I found out quickly was that it was not feasible to get consistent pictures from my virtual students where I could actually see there work. And even if I could, I did not have time to go through it all. We do justification and explanation type questions where they have to explain how they solved a problem to me. The pictures of your work or else you do not get credit hill was not one I was willing to die on. They put their answers into a google form. Pick your battles. Some things may be ideal and better but in the here and now, we can only do what we can only do. Mostly - give yourself the grace to accept that this year can be great, but that it is going to be a different kind of great. Plan for twice the time on everything. Go slow. Be repetitive in your instructions and activity formats. Decide if the fun activities that take up a ton of in-class time are really worth the excruciatingly drawn out amount of time they would take to do virtual.... and if they are not, then save them for next year. Are collaborative projects better then independent worksheets? Yup. But are they feasible for a hybrid classroom with one teacher? For me - no. Do what you can. Let go of the rest. Also - wear your mask and practice social distancing. I started this year thinking that will not be me. I Am not getting anywhere near those germ infested hormone filled monsters ... then I got into the classroom with them, and all I want to do is hug them and tell them its all going to be ok.",teaching hybrid going really well honestly lot work biggest advice treat like virtual kid give assignment one person one job cannot expected stay sane teach face face kid different lesson virtual kid transitioned flipped classroom module instruction prerecorded found youtube recorded kid watch video complete independent practice problem problem turn given feedback correct answer solve time picture solve take question quiz end show know every day except friday play spiral review game usually jeopardy kid working pull individual answer question explain concept need help also answer email reach virtual kid lesson standard specific include real world application much possible teach math one thing started year wanting picture student work found quickly feasible get consistent picture virtual student could actually see work even could time go justification explanation type question explain solved problem picture work else get credit hill one willing die put answer google form pick battle thing may ideal better mostly give grace accept year great going different kind great plan twice time everything go slow repetitive instruction activity format decide fun activity take ton class time really worth excruciatingly drawn amount time would take virtual save next year collaborative project better independent worksheet yup feasible hybrid classroom one teacher let go rest also wear mask practice social distancing started year thinking getting anywhere near germ infested hormone filled monster got classroom want hug tell going ok,hybrid biggest virtual give stay different virtual flipped complete independent correct solve quiz know friday spiral pull individual answer email virtual standard specific real much possible feasible consistent virtual willing answer pick better give great different great twice slow repetitive decide worth drawn virtual next independent feasible hybrid mask social ok

Now my first thought is that he will not learn from a suspension, but you cannot assume things and it is best to show that you care and do not want to leave him to figure things out the hard way.

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"Last year was my first year and I had a hard time with classroom management. I came in hard and disciplinarian like. This year I decided a different route. First thing is to manage their time. Always have some activity for them to do. Make them work because that is going to be your shield. Second is to always have a routine and special tasks for students who volunteer. Give them a bit of ownership in the class even though in reality you run the show. Last, but most important, positive reinforcement to the well behaved students. Instead of giving attention to the negative behavior, focus on the ones who are doing the right thing, call out the student who is doing good, and reward that good student in front of everyone. Candy, stickers, compliments, and breaks in class. You reward the good ones the bad ones will start to ask for the reward then you tell them to earn it. Follow the three tier system of discipline for the bad kids. Low level behavior like talking in class or making weird sounds- use proximity control like standing around them, tapping on their desk, and saying their name. Mid level- give them a verbal warning but make sure not in front of the class because that is what they want. High level b.s.- take them outside and let them know if they do not cut it you will let their parents know. Remember you have the power in that class. If you sink to their level or give the bad kids any kind of attention, you lose the power. Last piece of advice. Build relationships with your students. Take the time to get to know them. Mention their likes, hobby, and or sports and they will feel like you care. Maybe have them write a letter about themselves with some questions that you have for them. Keep the first few surface level like favorite food and stuff. The last few can be their goals and aspirations. Take notes on those things. Be intentional on bringing it up to one of your students. 98% of the time all they want is to be noticed and want your attention. Give that student a minute of your time and you got them. Also sorry for the long rant but do not forget you got to sell them on what your teaching. They need a buy in or a reason to want to work for you.

MiddleSchoolTeacher,"Personally, I have the most success with students when I take the time to build relationships with them. Basically, I get kids to behave by showing that I care, and then because they like me they work hard for me. (One reason I hate subbing no time to build relationships!) So my first questions would be: what did you do last week in the first week of school to build relationships? I think until their behavior is under control you will not be able to teach anyway, so you might as well pause the curriculum and devote 100% of your time to building relationships now before this goes any further. You can google team builders, or reply to this comment and Ill share the things I do (not that my activities are perfect they are just a start, at least!) Realistically, you can only build relationships as fast as you can build trust. And that takes time. So in the meantime, what kind of management system do you have? Sounds like they are not motivated by the typical stuff admin, parents, etc. do not phase them. What are the positives they earn? If they are super-social, you could say something like you are giving them 5 (or 10?) mins of talk time at the end of class, but every time they stop the teaching to talk, they lose a minute...so they can either get their time in short increments in the middle of class or altogether at the end. You could also do a whole brain teaching type of competition you vs. them. When they are behaving as expected, they get a point. When they are not, you get a point. Decide as a group what the rewards will be for each side. For this, you have to find what motivates them. I had one class once that wanted a free period, so I played a G-rated movie if they won. They could win as often as once a month, but we got so much done during the other days that it was not a big deal if I lost a day of instruction a month. You can also ask the local stores and restaurants for donations as prizes. A friend of mine gave out mini-gift cards to McDonalds once. Just got to find what motivates them. Hang in there!

Middleschoolteachers,"I taught for over three decades as all grades levels. For a short time I taught middle school language arts. My advice comes less from my direct experience in the classroom than from watching more children grow and learn. They are both adults now. They are very well educated and very successful. When they were young, I watched they play video games and while many parents and teachers were dismayed by the whole video game phenomenon, I observed that my boys were learning among other things literary elements as they played. In you case I would suggest that you might start within the students' experience and begin to ask them about the games they play. As they talk about it begin to put labels on the elements they describe and begin to say it reminds you of something you read... This could become a springboard into discussions in which the connections between games within their experience and books not with their experience come to be seen as part of the same thing.",taught three decade grade level short time taught language art advice come le direct experience classroom watching child grow learn adult well educated successful young watched play video game many parent teacher dismayed whole video game phenomenon observed boy learning among thing literary element played case would suggest might start within student experience begin ask game play talk begin put label element describe begin say reminds something read could become springboard discussion connection game within experience book experience come seen part thing,taught short taught le direct successful young many dismayed whole boy literary label springboard

Middleschoolteachers,"What level are you teaching? I teach middle school and I find myself frequently using graphic organizers, which really focuses student attention to the most important parts of the text. I use the Cornell note system infrequently as well (although this skill takes time to develop in the middle school). As a side note, regardless of your note-taking system, I would recommend having a lesson focus question (preferably open-ended or provocative) which students are expected to engage with throughout the lesson and be able to answer at the end. Throughout the lesson this question can also serve as a guide to note-taking, discussion, and checks for understanding. I would also recommend (sorry if this is too much) developing a simple annotation system for students as they engage with the text. That why you can identify their skill-level or understanding of the text and also ensure that they are active readers. This past year I used Interactive Student Notebooks and it greatly helped student organization (middle school :)). Good luck on your first year of teaching!

Middleschoolteachers,"Amen. This would not work for most elementary school kids who do not always see the value in learning. Despite what everyone seems to think, not every child likes spending hours a day in front of a computer, and no matter how much data a computer can take in, there is no way for it to deliver any sort of feasible consequence to a child. Forget the fact that it requires a child to be self motivated to login for it to even work. I cannot imagine what this would look like for kids who have any sort of disability in areas of executive function, auditory or visual processing, fine motor skills or emotional and behavior issues. Having delivered an ""engaging"" computer based program, my kids grew tired of it a month in and actually asked to read books instead (middle school). A lot of the programs require a lot of repetition to reteach for errors and that drains on a kid who struggles with learning. One would also have account for the social piece in that we would still need these computer-based environments in areas where kids can be social...or a society of kids who do not understand body language? Parents will be responsible for socializing them? I am sure computers will become more prominent in helping to personalize learning environments to meet the needs and interests of students, I just do not imagine how we would completely remove the human component. Even if it is just to make sure the kid does not spend the entire day out at ""recess"".",amen would work kid always see value learning despite everyone seems think every child like spending hour day front computer matter much data computer take way deliver sort feasible consequence child forget fact requires child self motivated login even work cannot imagine would look like kid sort disability area executive function auditory visual processing fine motor skill emotional behavior issue delivered engaging computer based program kid grew tired month actually asked read book instead lot program require lot repetition reteach error drain kid struggle learning one would also account social piece would still need computer based environment area kid social society kid understand body language parent responsible socializing sure computer become prominent helping personalize learning environment meet need interest student imagine would completely remove human component even make sure kid spend entire day recess,front feasible child login cannot auditory visual fine skill emotional tired read lot social social responsible sure prominent human sure spend entire

Middleschoolteachers,"I am a middle school physical science teacher with 12 years of experience. Let me give you some hints. Do not just do notes. Notes are boring. The first thing you should do is figure out how you want to break your class up into units. Measurement. Linear motion. Circular motion. Things like that. After you have decided what your first unit will be, decide what kinds of activities you want your students to do. If you are starting with something really simple like displacement and speed and simple linear motion, work out what you want to cover as notes and how you want to then implement that knowledge. Find some worksheets where they apply the formulas that you are teaching. Then, create (or borrow) hands on labs that the kids can use. I like to start with the big picture. *What are my over all topics?* Then, I look at the subtopics of those topics. *What exactly do the kids need to know about this?* Then, I look at how I can make them use the knowledge. *What is an activity that we can do?* Once you have gotten that out of the way, I suggest breaking your class period into manageable chunks. 5 minutes to go over last night's homework. 20 minutes of direct instruction/guided practice. 10 minutes of independent practice/go over that independent practice. 10 minutes to start on tonight's homework. Tomorrow there will be a lab. (Do not really have a lab every other day. You will drive yourself insane.) Work on one unit at a time. Spend the first week getting to know the kids and assessing their level of knowledge. Do not beat yourself up when things do not work. Heck, there are times when I say to my students, ""Okay, kids, I have never done this before. This whole thing could crash and burn. Let us see what happens."" They are usually pretty cool with that. Oh, and one last thing, high school kids can be big assholes. Do not let them get to you. Do not try to be their friend. Do not try to get them to think you are cool.

Middleschoolteachers,"Disclaimer: Music Teacher What do you love about your job? The kids. They are curious and willing to learn about anything. Even on my worst days they motivate me to do a better job which in turn motivates them. It is a glorious cycle. What do you hate about your job? The paperwork. I teach all 500+ kids at my school which means my IEP, 504, Behavior issues folder is about 8 inches tall. With the little planning time I am given it is impossible to keep up with it all. How easy is it to find a job as a newly qualified elementary school teacher? I started at middle school my first year and only moved to elementary for year 3 and this coming year number 4. It took me 6 months to find a job but I moved at the end of January/December so the timing was bad. I would say for music it really depends on the area, even as much as 20-30 miles one direction can make a huge different in job availability. What are the main differences between grades 1-3 and grades 4-6? I teach down to PreK. So I will start there. The little ones, Prek and K, are very shy at first and I spend a lot of time getting them to be comfortable in the room and comfortable to sing/play instruments and not be afraid of making mistakes. After we get rolling though they are a blast and I feel like I can do anything with them. 1-2 They are similar to the lower grades still however they are already willing to do everything without having to convince them. They are mostly happy to do something besides sit at a desk for another hour. 3-5 is a difficult group, particularly coming in as a new music teacher. They do not like to sing in front of new people as singing is now a girls and little kids thing so I have to be sneaky about how I get them to do it. The best thing about the big kids is that I do not have to do much set up anymore. Orff day? they get them out and put them away. Percussion day? same. playing a game? they do it all and it saves a ton of set up time for me that I have to do for the little kids a lot. What is your favorite grade to teach? PreK and K. Least favorite is 5th grade. But I still love all my kids and tell them regularly. If you could do it all again, would you choose the same career path? Why or why not? Yes. I love my job and sometimes it is hard to consider it work since I get to play games, sing, and play instruments all day. There is still a heavy curriculum in teaching singing, note reading, rhythms, and vocabulary however it can all be taught in a very hands on, fun way.",disclaimer music teacher love job kid curious willing learn anything even worst day motivate better job turn motivates glorious cycle hate job paperwork teach kid mean pep behavior issue folder inch tall little planning time given impossible keep easy find job newly qualified teacher started first year moved year coming year number took month find job moved end january december timing bad would say music really depends area even much mile one direction make huge different job availability main difference grade grade teach prep start little one prep i shy first spend lot time getting comfortable room comfortable sing play instrument afraid making mistake get rolling though blast feel like anything similar lower grade still however already willing everything without convince mostly happy something besides sit desk another hour difficult group particularly coming new music teacher like sing front new people singing girl little kid thing sneaky get best thing big kid much set anymore off day get put away percussion day playing game save ton set time little kid lot favorite grade teach prep i least favorite the grade still love kid tell regularly could would choose career path yes love job sometimes hard consider work since get play game sing play instrument day still heavy curriculum teaching singing note reading rhythm vocabulary however taught hand fun way,curious willing worst better glorious behavior tall little impossible keep easy find first moved january bad huge different main prep little first comfortable comfortable sing afraid mistake rolling blast similar lower willing happy difficult new front new girl little kid sneaky best big much little favorite career hard play heavy vocabulary taught
Middleschoolteachers,"I teach STEM classes at a middle school. My district switched over to Project Lead the Way just over 3 years ago, but with my old curriculum I used several free sources to enhance the curriculum software we had. I am sure you can use some of these to build some lessons. I will also list some other websites that I currently use. **West Point Bridge** - https://bridgecontest.org -- Free Engineering and Bridge building software. The have a national contest that students can enter, but it is not required. My student's loved using this program. My students used this while also building bridges out of balsa wood strips which we tested to see how much force they could hold. (I realize that this is more Engineering than Technology, but was't sure where you needed to take your curriculum. I could probably give you some of my old resources for the balsa bridges if your interested.) I am pretty sure the West Point website will have something that you can use to create lessons. **Code.org** - lots of good sources to teach coding to students. The even have a lesson for teachers that do not have computers for the students to use. http://code.org **Graphic Design** - https://pixlr.com - Pixlr Editor and Pixlr Express - free online graphic design programs that students can use to modify and transform photos. You could also do a **""STEM Investigation""** - Students pick a type of technology - one that they are unfamiliar with! - research it - history, inventor(s), uses, etc. - and then create a powerpoint/Google Slides to share with the class.

Middleschoolteachers,"I do like letting students choose seats, but this does not work quite as nicely in middle school. For the last two years, I have been tracking behavior with Class Dojo (which I love but will stop using because it makes me more of a judge and less of a scorekeeper; I am going to have students fill out rubrics for themselves instead). If any class scored above 90% for a seating chart period (about a month), they would earn the right to sit where they want. Nothing brought down a class's behavior quite so quickly. And the problem was that the four troublemakers would sit together and when I needed to break them up... there was nowhere to move them to without taking away a strong student's hard-earned right to choose his/her seat. I will consider your rule of forced separation and see whether I can work that in later.

Middleschoolteachers,"I have taught both high school and middle school. When I was single, I had this freakishly small class scheduled at the high school -- only about 17 students by some fluke in the counseling office. Somehow, they figured out I was dating (either overheard me talking to another teacher or pieced it together from me not talking about a boyfriend or husband). They teased me relentlessly but were adorably good-natured about it. It was a writing class so every time we did a sample assignment on the board and they got to choose the topic, it would either be about a bad date or a euphemism for sex. Some of their creative writing pieces sent me on dates with Ronald McDonald and Andrew Lincoln from *The Walking Dead*. We made outlines for breakfast food that got entirely creepy based on their insistence that you must PROTECT your lap with a napkin before eating. I mean, truly, it was all so ridiculous but completely silly and harmless in the end. Not that every class would react that way and turn out so positive, but it sort of restored my faith in [teenage] humanity. When I taught middle school, I was already with my SO.

Middleschoolteachers,"I had a pretty fun student teaching experience, but my wife and my roommate both had terrible experiences and ended up changing placements. I will write about all three separately. Mine: I was a music ed student. I student taught 6-12 band but going backwards (oldest kids in the morning, 6th graders last period). I had two CTs. The high school CT dropped me in Jazz band to fend for myself from day 1 and dropped me with the lower HS band in week 2. He payed very little attention to what I was doing and let me pretty much roll with the baton. It was fun, but it was scary-like I could easily screw this up and no one would know-scary. In middle school I was watched a little more closely and I had extremely difficult kids (inner-city). Planning for this ate up most of my time, but I always felt like I was skating compared to my wife (fiance at the time) and roommate. I ended up not going into teaching though because of the low pay and politics. Wife (Jane for reddit purposes): We will call her CT Amy (neither real names). Amy expected Jane at school at a particular time. When Jane walked in a square 30 seconds late, it was a *huge* deal. She would regularly tell Jane that she was not as prepared as she should be. Jane would come in and spend ten to thirty seconds to do something in the morning, but be told she should have done it the night before. None of this would have been particularly major were it not for the fact that Amy would report Jane every time. If Jane asked Amy a question -*any* question- she would be told that she was un-prepared. At the end of the first month, Jane was told she had way too much negative paperwork and she might get dropped from Stu-teaching. Jane let Amy report her one more time before requesting a new placement. Roommate (John): we will call his CT Mary (again neither are real names.) Mary was famous in the school for bad-mouthing the other teachers behind their backs and then being perplexed when none of them liked her. She had been at it for years before John became the stu-teacher. Her habit of being negative carried over to John because of his inability to be *impatient* with the students and she would make him write and re-write his lessons until he had two weeks worth of sub-plan like write-ups that scripted exactly like *she* would do it. The last straw was when another teacher told John she had heard Mary saying she did not think John had done well enough to merit any sort of letter of recommendation. John asked for another CT an hour later and was granted.",pretty fun student teaching experience wife roommate terrible experience ended changing placement write three separately mine music ed student student taught band going backwards oldest kid morning the grader last period two it it dropped jazz band fend day dropped lower i band week payed little attention let pretty much roll baton fun scary like could easily screw one would know scary watched little closely extremely difficult kid inner city planning ate time always felt like skating compared wife fiance time roommate ended going teaching though low pay politics wife jane reddit purpose call it amy neither real name amy expected jane particular time jane walked square second late huge deal would regularly tell jane prepared jane would come spend ten thirty second something morning told done night none would particularly major fact amy would report jane every time jane asked amy question question would told un prepared end first month jane told way much negative paperwork might get dropped stu teaching jane let amy report one time requesting new placement roommate john call it mary neither real name mary famous bad mouthing teacher behind back perplexed none liked year john became stu teacher habit negative carried john inability impatient student would make write write lesson two week worth sub plan like write ups scripted exactly like would last straw another teacher told john heard mary saying think john done well enough merit sort letter recommendation john asked another it hour later granted,fun terrible write mine ed oldest last lower little much scary watched little difficult inner ate low real particular square second late huge prepared ten thirty second major amy prepared much negative jane new real mary famous bad back perplexed stu negative john impatient write write sub write last john mary merit

Middleschoolteachers,"Mine was interesting. I did my licensure in Memphis before the country and city schools combined so I had a junior high placement at a then Memphis City school and a high school placement at a Shelby County school. Some background for those who do not know, Memphis has one of the worst school situations in the country, it is absolutely awful, which is why you can make upwards of $70k after a few years, but I digress. Before the consolidation of the districts (and then the suburbs forming their own districts) it was pretty widely known in our program that Memphis city was to teach you classroom management and Shelby county was to teach you everything else. So my first placement was in a low-performing middle school teaching 8th grade Social Studies. I was one of two white men on campus teaching 120 students split about 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic (about half of whom spoke English). I learned more about managing a classroom in 8 weeks than I ever learned in school. Luckily, my cooperating teacher was always in the room with me and gave me the backup I needed when I inevitably got accused of racism by the students. Most of the students were there most of the time but I had about 1/4 who out of the 8 weeks of my assignment I saw them about 5 days. It was rough, I spent much more time getting kids to sit down and stop fighting than I ever did teacher, which is what convinced me that I am not right for those type of situations. I did have one honors class that was absolutely delightful, I never had to get on to them and I was able to do a TON of actual teaching with them, which is probably what saved me. My Shelby county placement was a dream. I was teaching Honors World History and US Government and after a week of observation, my cooperating teacher told me the classroom was mine and just let me do my thing. I had complete control and I LOVED it. I was able to establish relationships with the students and looked forward to going to school everyday. All in all, my advice is this: 1. You get out of student teaching what you and your cooperating teacher put into it. If either of you do not make the effort and try, you will not learn a thing. 2. Next, ask for help! If you do not get any from your cooperating teacher, site supervisor, or administration, tell someone so you can get it fixed. 3. You will want to quit at some point, try and get through the semester before making any decision about it though",mine interesting license memphis country city school combined junior placement memphis city placement shelby county background know memphis one worst situation country absolutely awful make upwards i year digress consolidation district suburb forming district pretty widely known program memphis city teach classroom management shelby county teach everything else first placement low performing teaching the grade social study one two white men campus teaching student split african american hispanic half spoke english learned managing classroom week ever learned luckily cooperating teacher always room gave backup needed inevitably got accused racism student student time week assignment saw day rough spent much time getting kid sit stop fighting ever teacher convinced right type situation one honor class absolutely delightful never get able ton actual teaching probably saved shelby county placement dream teaching honor world history u government week observation cooperating teacher told classroom mine let thing complete control loved able establish relationship student looked forward going everyday advice get student teaching cooperating teacher put either make effort try learn thing next ask help get cooperating teacher site supervisor administration tell someone get fixed want quit point try get semester making decision though,license memphis junior worst awful i shelby first low social white african american hispanic english accused much stop convinced right delightful able actual shelby honor u told let able everyday student learn next supervisor want semester

Middleschoolteachers,"It was extremely challenging, scary, stressful, overwhelming, demanding, and the single most rewarding experience of my life so far. I give major props to my credential program for doing it right (CSUF). I had a science degree previously, so it was one semester of pre-reqs followed by a full year of student teaching along with other classes and the dreaded TPA's. It was so valuable to see the entire arc of a year, from setting it up in the beginning to wrapping it up at the end. I am not sure i would have felt ready to teach after 12 weeks or one semester. My mentor teacher was a.ma.zing. Within the first week she had provided me with digital copies of all of her resources, along with paper copies of her lesson plans from the previous year. She had impeccable classroom management and helped me out with behavior issues throughout the whole year. Any time I am faced with a difficult situation, I literally think ""what would Mary do?"" She was fine with me using her resources but was also very encouraging when I wanted to take things in a different direction. Obviously there are things I do differently than she does now, a few years in to my career, but she gave me such a great framework for how to run a middle school science classroom. I am not sure I would have survived without such a fabulous mentor.

Middleschoolteachers,"It is really going to depend on your programs and your cooperating teacher. I majored in special education in Wisconsin. I had a full year practicum in a middle school history/language arts classroom with a gen ed teacher to learn about that side of things. First semester I was only there one day a week for a few hours. I was basically an assistant, helped with a weekly email to parents and talked planning. The second semester, I was there four hours a day four days a week. It worked out that she had two groups of students, AM and PM. So even though I only saw the AM students, she was just doing the same thing in the afternoon with new kids so I felt like I had a pretty good experience. My teacher was really OK with almost anything. I taught a whole history unit I made and some parts of the day sort of became the time I took over. But mostly I observed and did assistant type things. It was a great opportunity to just talk to a teacher about things like organization, overall curriculum planning, politics around education, etc. In my final year, I was a full time student teacher. But in special Ed you are certified k-12 so my first semester was in an elementary school and my second semester was at a high school. At the elementary school, I went to the school in August and did PD with my teacher and although it was not required, it made the year start off much smoother as I was not learning everything all at once (not just being a teacher, but the layout of the school, IEPs of students, met staff before they were in the throes of school year, etc.). My cooperating teacher was awesome! We game planned how each day would go (which SEA would be with which kid, what groups we would need) and planned on me taking one reading and one math group and she would take one reading and one math group. I really felt like I was part of the planning and the team in general (I got a lot of time working with the gen ed teachers we supported too and they let me lead whole class lessons sometime too) At the high school level, I planned and taught our self-container math class every day, helped out in the resource room we ran for one block a day and then my cooperating teacher and I supported a gen ed history class. I made alternate materials/assessments and contributed in the history class to the general discussion as best I could (I was also a double major in history so it was a fun class for me to support). In our seminars, my fellow student teachers and I would just talk about our weeks. What I really found out was as long as you had a supportive cooperating teacher, the role is really what you make it. Need to practice parent communication? Ask if you can send emails or be the one to make a call home. Classroom management? Come up with something you lead the class in every day that gives you the opportunity to be in front of them. I remember some girls in my program seeming kind of unsure of what they were doing or feeling like they were not getting direction from their cooperating teachers, but you really just got to try things. You cannot get fired (unless you are REALLY bad I guess), so do not be afraid to try new things, even if they do not work. You have someone with you to help out in case something goes wrong, a luxury you will not have later. Do not be afraid to be unknowledgeable or make mistakes! Even if there was something I thought I knew for sure, I enjoyed playing dumb or naive at times (because you are in a sense! You are only a student teacher. People should be understanding) and trying to get the best advice I could from other teachers.

Middleschoolteachers,"It was interesting. I could not decide which grade level I wanted to do since I was being certified grades 7-12, so I was one of very few (maybe the only) in my cohort to split the semester up. I spent 8 weeks in 8th grade at a middle school and 8 weeks in 11th and 12th grade at a high school just down the street from the MS. I was hoping the two experiences would make it clear which age group I preferred, but I really did not end up with a preference at all (and still do not). My 8th grade placement teacher had me just watch for about 2 weeks, then we co-taught for a bit, then the last 2-3 weeks I pretty much did everything on my own. She had a very clearly outlined curriculum, and I just followed it. I also put in grades and sat in on parent-teacher conferences, all with her oversight. At my second placement, my teacher quickly let me take over her classes after seeing that I was relatively capable of doing so. By the end of my time there, she rarely came in to school at all (which is highly illegal, but our room was out in BFE and no one ever came to check on us) and I did everything. She wrote me one of the nicest letters I have ever received about how amazing I was as a teacher and how she would want her kids to have me. Overall, I enjoyed my student teaching and felt relatively prepared. Yeah, no. Maybe it is because I moved to a different state, or had a totally different student population, but NOTHING about my student teaching prepared me for having my own classroom. My students now are nothing like the ones in my student teaching, and a huge part of teaching is lesson planning, which is pretty much all done for you when you student teach. I had to come up with several of my own (very long and thorough) lesson plans for university administrators when they came to observe me, but other than that, I was following what my cooperating teachers had already had planned.

Middleschoolteachers,"I am just looking at Technology Educations perspective in the educational community from non-technology teachers. People think that technology education is just teaching kids to use computers..which it is not. My technology education curriculum covers Electronics, Engineering Design Process, Computer Aided Design, Electro-Mechanics, Computer Numeric Control, Technologies effect on Society, Computer Science, Robotics, Woodworking, metalworking, and some independent study projects of my choosing. I obtained the NYS BEDS data for the number of technology teachers in the state of New York. In 1998 there were about 2,792 Technology teachers (2,294 in license--498 out of license), in 2012 by last count there were only 2,463 (2159 in license--304 out of license.) The numbers are growing far dimmer, in NYS there are 3 colleges that have technology education majors. Oswego, Buffalo State College, and CUNY City Tech in Brooklyn. Buffalo State, Oswego and City Tech combined are only pumping out about &lt;70 graduates per yer total i would say, probably closer to about 50 I would say. I attended Buff State, our graduating class was last semester, probably had around 15. Only like 3-4 new freshman in the program now. The problem with technology education is the name! It used to be manual arts, then industrial arts, then technology education and it is slowly transitioning to technology and engineering education now. Also a problem is lack of unified curriculum. Middle school has no real set curriculum at all, its up to the teachers. High school has somewhat more consistency. Now remember every middle schooler is required to have a technology credit....even though some schools do not. And there are only 2,463 or less tech teachers for the state. I am teaching in NYC, I would guess that I am 1 of about 5 or 6 certified real technology teachers in a city of over 8 million.. Its mind blowing. It is my first year and I will be designing a engineering curriculum for the middle school. Another issue is how teachers percieve us, industrial arts was once the ""room of failures."" We have struggled to overcome this and other educators cannot understand this, they do not get that techology is NOT just computers, it is the theory of design, the theory of structures, farming, electronics, we would define technology as the study of technique, or manipulating our world to suit our needs. However hte average teacher still percieves us as a joke, especially in NYC. However we see this big STEM push, its funny how NO ONE EVER mentions E or T in stem, just math and science, it blows my mind, because engineering is the combined application of science, math and tech. And science and math would not be possible without technology and vice versa. Another issue is funding, a good tech program requires so much funding most schools cannot do it. In the school i am working at we have a 3D printer, some smart tables, yet we lack power machines because NYC is so turned off by the idea of leaving a saw in a room with city kids, however I was trained in this....i am a professional, the only thing holding back these programs is lack of funding and administrators not having faith. So in summary I am a younger teacher, first year, I am designing my own curriculum and will eventually design a 6-8 layered class. Trying to do this with little to no budget, and lack of confidence in me. However we OWE it to urban kids to give them this type of education that many kids in nyc do not get like the kids upstate. I want to change the entire notion of this subject, even if it means one school at a time. Not every kid excels in a traditional classroom, this gives everyone a chance to think creatively, and outside the box and not be constrained by state tests.",looking technology education perspective educational community non technology teacher people think technology education teaching kid use computer technology education curriculum cover electronics engineering design process computer aided design electro mechanic computer numeric control technology effect society computer science robotics woodworking metalworking independent study project choosing obtained ny bed data number technology teacher state new york technology teacher license license last count license license number growing far dimmer ny college technology education major wego buffalo state college cunt city tech brooklyn buffalo state wego city tech combined pumping it graduate per yer total would say probably closer would say attended buff state graduating class last semester probably around like new freshman program problem technology education name used manual art industrial art technology education slowly transitioning technology engineering education also problem lack unified curriculum real set curriculum teacher somewhat consistency remember every schooler required technology credit even though school le tech teacher state teaching ny would guess certified real technology teacher city million mind blowing first year designing engineering curriculum another issue teacher perceive u industrial art room failure struggled overcome educator cannot understand get technology computer theory design theory structure farming electronics would define technology study technique manipulating world suit need however hte average teacher still perceives u joke especially ny however see big stem push funny one ever mention e stem math science blow mind engineering combined application science math tech science math would possible without technology vice versa another issue funding good tech program requires much funding school cannot working printer smart table yet lack power machine ny turned idea leaving saw room city kid however trained professional thing holding back program lack funding administrator faith summary younger teacher first year designing curriculum eventually design layered class trying little budget lack confidence however owe urban kid give type education many kid ny get like kid upstate want change entire notion subject even mean one time every kid excels traditional classroom give everyone chance think creatively outside box constrained state test,perspective educational mechanic numeric independent ny new last dimmer ny major wego graduate attended last new freshman manual industrial curriculum real consistency certified real first perceive u industrial overcome hte u ny big possible good much lack saw professional summary younger first layered little owe urban type many ny upstate entire traditional outside
Middleschoolteachers,"I taught Composition (11th grade) for several years, so the essays counted as tests. I did a mini unit on plagiarism, going over different ways it could happen and having discussions and practice assignments so the kids could fully understand the concept. Throughout the course, I kept showing them how to avoid plagiarism (citing sources). Even with all of that, there would usually still be 1-2 students per semester who would do something stupid. When I taught other grades/courses, I did give a disclaimer as I was handing out tests/quizzes, which I stole and adapted from my mentor teacher way back when I was student-teaching in college. It was this big ridiculous thing I would say as I was passing out the materials, like, ""If you are doing 'x,' I will have to assume you are cheating. If you are cheating, I will take your [test/quiz] away from you, rip it up, stomp on it, throw it in the recycling bin, do a little dance, and [huge breath]... make you cry! And you are such smart, lovely people, I would really hate to make you cry today, so it is really better if you do not do 'x.'"" Of course, it always got a laugh and helped relieve a little stress right before the test... and if need be, I would go through it several times with 'x' being something different each time -- talking, looking at someone else's paper, having a phone or electronic device out, using notes or a cheat sheet (if they were not allowed or I had not signed them in, etc.). If I had anything kind of complicated going on, like use of cheat sheets but only if they were checked in by a certain date or use of one notes sheet but not another, I would print that at the top of the test/quiz very clearly. Another teacher in my building has something on his tests about how the test is not over just because you (the student) finishes, but rather, the test is over when he says it is over. There are some consequences outlined for talking / goofing off before he gives the final word. I think it helps him manage behavior while everyone has a chance to finish. Having taught middle school, I would just point out that they are generally pretty terrible at reading directions, so even if you put a disclaimer on the test, I would read it aloud and point it out to them EVERY TIME. Heck, I would include the disclaimer on any study/guide materials before the quiz/test -- I found immediately that having something to hand out a week (or more) before the test to prepare them was the only way to avoid 1,000,0000 questions of ""what is the quiz going to be like?"" and ""will that be on the test?""",taught composition the grade several year essay counted test mini unit plagiarism going different way could happen discussion practice assignment kid could fully understand concept throughout course kept showing avoid plagiarism citing source even would usually still student per semester would something stupid taught grade course give disclaimer handing test quiz stole adapted mentor teacher way back student teaching college big ridiculous thing would say passing material like i assume cheating cheating take test quiz away rip stomp throw recycling bin little dance huge breath make cry smart lovely people would really hate make cry today really better i course always got laugh helped relieve little stress right test need would go several time i something different time talking looking someone else paper phone electronic device using note cheat sheet allowed signed etc anything kind complicated going like use cheat sheet checked certain date use one note sheet another would print top test quiz clearly another teacher building something test test student finish rather test say consequence outlined talking goofing give final word think help manage behavior everyone chance finish taught would point generally pretty terrible reading direction even put disclaimer test would read aloud point every time heck would include disclaimer study guide material quiz test found immediately something hand week test prepare way avoid question quiz going like test,taught several test different avoid student stupid taught give big ridiculous rip bin little huge lovely i laugh little several i different electronic note certain top test give final behavior finish terrible disclaimer aloud avoid
Middleschoolteachers,"On top of the ever important establishment of rules and routines, I think getting to know your students is important. I am K/1, so middle school is obviously going to be way different, but I would definitely start creating a classroom community right away. Ask your students questions, have them ask each other questions, have them ask you questions, etc. Make connections with parents/families as soon as possible. Send home parent letters prior to school starting, send home an introduction letter, or anything to connect to your parents from the get go in a positive way. For K, it is important that I introduce my students to the faces of the school, so I present a slideshow of the staff with pictures and names.

Middleschoolteachers,"In California, you will not have too hard a time finding a job as a science teacher. I might expand my options to including middle school. I cannot specifically speak to which classes you should take since I did not get my credentials in science, but if you want to teach a particular type of science (like chem) definitely take classes in that. You will have to enter a credential program for your teaching courses. Here in CA, tattoos are not an issue. One of the new hires at my school has a sleeve tattoo that she keeps covered with long sleeves. There is a bunch of other teachers with tattoos on their feet or on their shoulders and they are never asked to cover them. Something to know about: Being a teacher is about connecting with your students.

Middleschoolteachers,"Set your rules and expectations and stick to them. Middle schoolers are masters at acting like every punishment is the end of the world and you are a evil dictator and they are good at laying on the guilt trip so you will feel sorry for them and back off (they do it to their parents too). Example: ""Bobby you made a mess with your project and you were disruptive to your classmates instead of cleaning up your mess. You cannot leave for your next class until it is all picked up""...typical middle school reaction to that ""Ah miss! I am not the only one that made a mess they did not clean up. Man! This is not fair! I am going to be late to athletics now because you are making me stay (insert eye rolling and tongue clicking)"". Ignore their protests and calmly tell them what they need to get done or do to get out of trouble in most of the time my students drop the dramatics in a few minutes do their punishment and the next day they are all smiles and act like it never happened. Just consider that the things that we say in our heads when we are annoyed or upset they are going to say out loud because they do not have that filter yet so do not take things they say personally. After a middle school tantrum (which really does not happen all that much if you have trained them in a routine) I will usually talk to them about how they should have handled the situation. Some good reads on how to deal with teenagers are The First Days of School by Wong and Teach Like a Champion.

Middleschoolteachers,"For me it is about 1-2%. Justin was a total sociopath who stole everything he could including his teacher's phone 3 times and 2 school laptops, never showed any contrition, just a shit-eating grin whenever anyone tried to discipline him. His mom was a meth addict. I never saw an ounce of sincerity with him, and I really really tried. Everything was a game, an act, a manipulation. He was pretty messed up. Caleb was a really smart kid who wanted to learn, but it was physically impossible for him to not shout out really loud comments ALL THE TIME. It got to the point where I started to count how many interruptions he made (directed at the whole class), and the first time I counted, he interrupted me or his classmates 53 times in a 50 minute class period. If that is not *impossible*, I do not know what is. Andres was a student who literally did no work, took no notes, and turned in no assignments for the entire year. I tried *every* tactic, nothing worked. He once took a 4-option multiple choice test with 60+ questions...and got an 8%when random guesses should probabilistically give you a 25%.

Middleschoolteachers,"I teach AVID 6th - 8th and coordinate the program on my campus. First of all, let me just say that I love teaching AVID. I taught English for four years before taking on the AVID position, and I am so glad to be a part of the program. It is extremely rewarding, but certainly carries a heavier (and different) workload than being a regular classroom teacher. The fact that you have been to Summer Institute before will definitely make things easier for you. I would still recommend trying to get your hands on the AVID Elective Essentials or Strategies for Success or whatever the curriculum guide is called (if you need a copy, PM me and I can send you a pdf) to familiarize yourself with the curriculum. For me, the two things that I found most challenging when I started AVID were managing tutorials and becoming more of a mentor/counselor to my students. There are a lot of pieces to get right for tutorials- setting up procedures, training your tutors, making sure students are really pushing themselves and not just going through the motions. If you can, try to visit another AVID class on a tutorial day to observe how they do things. That really helped me see what to do and what not to do. It may be because I teach middle school, or because I get each cohort of AVID students for 3 years, but I have found that being an AVID teacher has made me become way more involved in my students' lives. This creates different challenges than I faced when teaching English. Many of my students see me as someone in between a teacher and a parent, so they come to me far more often than they did before for help, advice, or just someone to talk to. It is nice to know that they place such trust in me, but it can be emotionally exhausting. In spite of this, let me just reiterate: I love teaching AVID.

Middleschoolteachers,"You are not, nor will you likely ever be, your students' friend (of course they may become your friends when they are older, but probably not). You should be approachable and fair (and maybe nice sometimes), but you are in charge. A friend that is acts that way is an asshole. A few teachers in my school go by Mr/s. Firstname or Mr/s. Nickname. We are pretty strict on the Mr/s. because we feel that learning to show respect to the people in charge (not blindly following, respect is different) is an important part of middle school and high school.

Middleschoolteachers,"I was a sub for a year and a half. It is entirely up to you, but when I started subbing I made a list of subjects I felt comfortable *enough* subbing for. Most teachers assume that their sub may not have the total content knowledge that is needed to execute a master lesson. I am certified in 6-12 English and 6-8 Math. Based on my personal skills and abilities, I took sub jobs in any middle school subject except French and Woodshop/""Tech Ed"", and I accepted high school jobs in English, Social Studies, Performing Arts and Home Ec. Now that I am teaching full time, I design my lesson plans so that the sub gives an assignment and the kids work on it. As a sub, I never encountered a sub plan that actually asked me to execute a lesson; I do not ask my subs to pull off a full lesson plan. I subbed in areas I was comfortable in just so I could walk in knowing that I could *probably* answer questions during the lesson. But do not stress.

Middleschoolteachers,"I got my MAT before going into teaching (I had a BA in History but needed the certification and figured that if I was taking the classes to get certified, I might as well get my Masters and be paid more). I lost count of the number of people who told me districts would not hire a new teacher with a Masters. Not sure how the rumor got started (perhaps some jaded people looking for a reason why they were not hired) but in my experience, the people who do the hiring (principles, department heads, etc.) have absolutely no interest in trying to save money by hiring someone with less experience. It does not even factor into the equation. The Board of Ed is responsible for coming up with a budget. Now, if it was a very small district, with low resources, I could see it possibly making a difference, but the majority of district budgets are in the millions. The extra 2 k that they pay a teacher with a Masters is a drop in the bucket. They spend more in an hour than the extra salary they would have to pay you. That being said, since you are already going to school for education (I am assuming that your program is a certification based program), you might be better off finding a job first and letting the district pay for your continuing education. Also, a new teacher in English has very few opportunities of landing a high school job (job saturation). You might have to teach middle school for a few years first. I am not saying it is impossible, more like improbable. If you have the right connection, you might very well end up in a high school.

Middleschoolteachers,"Hi, thanks very much for your input. The preparation that TFA provides is my biggest concern atm. I am fairly confident in my ability to prepare and teach a subject....but like someone else on here said, there is more to teaching than that. I answered your first Q in another reply: As far as being a new teacher goes, I am a non-traditional student right now, I will be 29 when I get my bachelor's. I had taken a few years off of studying to work, surprisingly, in academia (oh how I love the irony). Anyhow, I have several years of tutoring experience with elementary and middle school kids, and 2 years as an instructor w/ one of the big test-prep companies teaching LSAT and GMAT to college students and adults. It is some classroom management experience, although I know it is not the same as teaching, especially not in one of the poorer performing districts. And yes, ideally I would teach high school but I would not mind having a middle school classroom. As far as disadvantaged youths- I had a few as tutoring students, and I would say they struggled far more than their peers, even in basic language skills. It always took more work on my part to understand the particular motivation and needs of an underprivileged kid and they tended to require more support and guidance from me. So, it is tougher over all. I guess my question to you, then, is how do your TFA colleagues compare to your traditional-teacher colleagues when it comes to that first year in the classroom?

I was about 22 or 23 when I started as well and I was concerned that I would not be taken seriously as an authority figure.

Middleschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade, and I am always sad when I hear about subs that will not sub for middle school. The kids are actually pretty great most of the time! The first thing you need to be a successful sub at the middle school level is good sub plans. Unfortunately, that is not in your control. Hopefully the teacher leaves clear plans that will keep the students occupied the entire period. If students have any extra time after finishing work, that will lead to problems. You might want to have a supplemental activity ready to go if the lesson plans the teacher left do not take the entire period. Nothing with homework, but something to keep them occupied. You cannot be their friend. You need to be structured and firm. When subs try to be ""cool"", it is always disastrous. One of my colleagues had a sub once who let the students listen to music on their phones. Without headphones. During a test. Nevermind that it was against school rules and ended up being a huge distraction to other kids trying to focus on their tests. If you are not sure of the rules, err on the side of being a buzzkill. You said you have been leaving detailed notes for the teacher, which is great. If it is minor problems, that is adequate. The teacher will follow up with those students when the get back, presumably. But if any student causes major problems, deal with it immediately. Send them to the office, or write them up, or whatever options are available at that school. If it is a major problem, it should not be allowed to continue to disrupt the class. When the teacher gets back, it is hard to know exactly what happened and assign consequences. As a sub, you do not know the kids well enough or have enough of a relationship for ""talking to them"" about the problem to have much effect. You need actions to back it up. As a young sub, you should try to emphasize your position as an authority figure by dressing very professionally and acting mature. Do not try to get any street cred by acting young, it will undermine your authority. Anecdotally, my students seem to hate subs that talk too much about themselves, their experiences, and things other than the lesson. Take that as you will. This is all just my opinion, but maybe you will find it helpful!",teach the grade always sad hear sub sub kid actually pretty great time first thing need successful sub level good sub plan unfortunately control hopefully teacher leaf clear plan keep student occupied entire period student extra time finishing work lead problem might want supplemental activity ready go lesson plan teacher left take entire period nothing homework something keep occupied cannot friend need structured firm sub try cool always disastrous one colleague sub let student listen music phone without headphone test nevermind rule ended huge distraction kid trying focus test sure rule err side buzzkill said leaving detailed note teacher great minor problem adequate teacher follow student get back presumably student cause major problem deal immediately send office write whatever option available major problem allowed continue disrupt class teacher get back hard know exactly happened assign consequence sub know kid well enough enough relationship talking problem much effect need action back young sub try emphasize position authority figure dressing professionally acting mature try get street cred acting young undermine authority anecdotal student seem hate sub talk much experience thing lesson take opinion maybe find helpful,sad hear great first successful sub good teacher clear occupied entire extra supplemental ready lesson left entire occupied cool disastrous huge focus err detailed great minor major available major disrupt assign enough much young young undermine anecdotal much lesson helpful

Middleschoolteachers,"**tl;dr: Getting into the classroom with TFA immediately after receiving your BA might be good for you from a professional standpoint, but it probably will not be good for your students or good for you mentally and physically.** This advice comes from a TFA alum who graduated with her BA, took three years to teach in a few different kinds of classrooms, then joined TFA. There is no quick or easy way to explain something this complicated. As another commenter pointed out, corps members (CMs from here on) have very diverse experiences. Based on the things you have said, however, I can give you some rudimentary feedback. **""My main reasons are that TFA would get me in a classroom immediately...""** * If you want to be a teacher, being in a classroom is a good thing. That said, you also mentioned that you may want to be an administrator, so I think you might first clarify your goals to make a better decision here. * If you are sure you want to be a teacher, then consider the following: TFA is not going to put you in an average classroom with average challenges. TFA will do its best to put you in an extremely difficult classroom with very serious challenges. You will be facing situations that even veteran teachers would struggle with, and you will be facing those situations with almost no experience and very limited support. Being well-versed in your subject matter is the least of your concerns: the majority of your students will come into your classroom several grade-levels behind and you will face challenging behaviors that you may never have expected. * Given this situation--and here I address my biggest beef with TFA--how can you be expected to be even a moderately successful teacher? TFA's guiding principle in this issue seems to be that if you just try hard enough, you can create positive change for your students. They are right in a certain light: consider moving a heavy, unwieldy object. It might be extraordinarily difficult to move that object by yourself, but it is possible with enough effort. But what if you had appropriate tools, like a dolly cart? It might still be heavy and present certain challenges, but it would be much less strain on you. Apply that to teaching. You have got a very difficult situation, and you can either struggle in brave ignorance or you can work more efficiently with good tools (i.e., pedagogical training, scaffolded teaching experience, appropriate resources, coaching from a mentor teacher, etc.). **""I am eager to have more hands-on experience teaching...""** * There are so many ways that you could get this experience that would not involve you taking full responsibility for the academic welfare of children who are at risk of failure in school or worse. Having those kinds of stakes as a new teacher leads to extreme stress which can then translate into burnout. **""I could possibly get some grants/scholarships through my involvement that would pay for (most of) my Masters""** This is true: Your membership in TFA will entitle you to an Americorps scholarship, and TFA has special relationships with several universities that will give you a discounted rate on top of that. However, there are a lot of other ways to get scholarships. **""I know I am in for a challenging 2 years...""** * Yes. More than you expect. I have never met a CM who did not feel at some point or another that he or she wanted to quit. **""Ideally I want to teach ELA and history for High School students""** That position is so idealized that a very large portion of candidates for TFA will also ask for the same assignment. Your competition would be stiff, and--depending on your region--you would probably be more likely to be assigned to something like middle school, which few CMs ask for, but many receive. **""and maybe work my way into administration after getting a Masters.""** If you want to be an administrator, it is helpful to have a teaching background, but I am concerned about the prospect that one might teach for a few years just as a pathway into administration. Almost no one--TFA or not--will be a very strong teacher until 3 years into teaching. If you plan to stick around in teaching for just a few years, you are just setting your students up for the next new teacher who will come in to replace you, struggle in his/her job for a few years, and then, often, leave the profession. Repeat ad nauseam. Also, if you have not had previous experience working full-time for extended periods, it will come as a big shock to you to suddenly be putting in 60-80 hour weeks. Loooooong story short, my recommendation would be for you to seek out some teaching experience elsewhere (hell, do what I did and teach English abroad for a year) in a situation that is less dire and high-stakes than the one into which TFA would put you. Get Doug Lemov's *Teach Like a Champion* and study it. If you want to teach English, also get Jim Burke's *The English Teacher's Companion.* Learn some stuff, then, when you are feeling good and ready to tackle perhaps the greatest social justice issue of our time, apply to TFA.",to do getting classroom tea immediately receiving ba might good professional standpoint probably good student good mentally physically advice come tea alum graduated ba took three year teach different kind classroom joined tea quick easy way explain something complicated another commenter pointed corp member am diverse experience based thing said however give rudimentary feedback main reason tea would get classroom immediately want teacher classroom good thing said also mentioned may want administrator think might first clarify goal make better decision sure want teacher consider following tea going put average classroom average challenge tea best put extremely difficult classroom serious challenge facing situation even veteran teacher would struggle facing situation almost experience limited support well versed subject matter least concern majority student come classroom several grade level behind face challenging behavior may never expected given situation address biggest beef tea expected even moderately successful teacher tea guiding principle issue seems try hard enough create positive change student right certain light consider moving heavy unwieldy object might extraordinarily difficult move object possible enough effort appropriate tool like dolly cart might still heavy present certain challenge would much le strain apply teaching got difficult situation either struggle brave ignorance work efficiently good tool e pedagogical training scaffolder teaching experience appropriate resource coaching mentor teacher etc eager hand experience teaching many way could get experience would involve taking full responsibility academic welfare child risk failure worse kind stake new teacher lead extreme stress translate burnout could possibly get grant scholarship involvement would pay master true membership tea entitle americorps scholarship tea special relationship several university give discounted rate top however lot way get scholarship know challenging year yes expect never met am feel point another wanted quit ideally want teach ela history student position idealized large portion candidate tea also ask assignment competition would stiff depending region would probably likely assigned something like am ask many receive maybe work way administration getting master want administrator helpful teaching background concerned prospect one might teach year pathway administration almost one tea strong teacher year teaching plan stick around teaching year setting student next new teacher come replace struggle job year often leave profession repeat ad nauseam also previous experience working full time extended period come big shock suddenly putting hour week looooong story short recommendation would seek teaching experience elsewhere hell teach english abroad year situation le dire stake one tea would put get doug lemon teach like champion study want teach english also get jim burke english teacher companion learn stuff feeling good ready tackle perhaps greatest social justice issue time apply tea,professional good good advice different tea quick easy corp diverse give rudimentary main good better average average best difficult serious limited subject least several biggest successful principle try enough positive certain light heavy unwieldy difficult possible enough appropriate present certain difficult good pedagogical appropriate eager many full academic worse new lead grant true entitle americorps special several top ela large ask likely many want helpful prospect strong next new struggle previous full extended big looooong short english doug lemon jim english good ready greatest social
Middleschoolteachers,"My school in the Southern YOU.S. has 7 period days (middle school). I teach 6 periods and get one period for preps (2 times a week we have meetings during this now, but that is under union dispute so we will see). Teachers arrive 1 hour before the kids, and the kids are there for 6.5 hours. Students and teachers get a 22-25 minute lunch, depending on how you view passing time vs. lunchtime. There are 4 minutes between classes. Students do not get breaks, unless you count passing time, which depending on where you are going, you may need to get to class. More and more classes are becoming academic - they take notes and stuff half the time in PE instead of playing. And if you fail the state tests, you lose your electives. Basically, the student who is passed the state test has 4 core classes and 3 electives (with PE being mandated unless you have a parental waiver or a supplemental class - meaning you failed the state test). Then, if you failed Math, you get an extra math class. If you failed Reading, you get an extra Reading class. If you failed both, and are not excluded by another test, you get an extra Study Skills/Test Prep course. At my Title 1 middle school, 75% have at least one extra class, and 30% this year have all 3 filled in. If you have even one extra class, you might not get a PE. Even when the kids have PE, they do not get any free time. No courses are allowed to give unstructured time to students and even the ability to give student choice is restricted as everything must follow the Learning Goal. Breaks in school are not a part of American culture these days. There is a lot of restriction compared to even when I was in school in the 90s. As to school start times, here it is 9:30 for Middle, 7:30 for HS (teachers arrive 15 minutes before kids and stay an hour after), and 8:30 for Elementary (teachers arrive a half hour before kids and stay a half hour after).",southern period day teach period get one period prep time week meeting union dispute see teacher arrive hour kid kid hour student teacher get minute lunch depending view passing time i lunchtime minute class student get break unless count passing time depending going may need get class class becoming academic take note stuff half time pe instead playing fail state test lose elective basically student passed state test core class elective pe mandated unless parental waiver supplemental class meaning failed state test failed math get extra math class failed reading get extra reading class failed excluded another test get extra study skill test prep course title least one extra class year filled even one extra class might get pe even kid pe get free time course allowed give unstructured time student even ability give student choice restricted everything must follow learning goal break part american culture day lot restriction compared even start time i teacher arrive minute kid stay hour teacher arrive half hour kid stay half hour,southern arrive minute i minute break academic pe fail elective parental supplemental extra extra extra skill extra extra pe free give unstructured break american start arrive arrive stay half

Middleschoolteachers,"I am responding to your updated cover letter. Point 1: No contractions in formal letters like this, e.g. I have, do not, should not. Spell it out. Yes, it varies per district and person, but spelling out the entire contraction never got any eyebrow raises than someone who used a contraction. Point 2: Put your name and contact information in the header above the district's address, similar to how you have it in your resume. If not that (which I recommend), put your contact information (email, number) at the end. Make this process as easy for them as possible. Flipping pages is a pain when you are doing it 500 times. Point 3: (Trying not to offend the poster who said this but...) NO TO THE PHOTO SUGGESTION. Please, for the love of teaching, do not do this. It will make you stand out for all the wrong reasons. They can easily discriminate based off of appearance if you do this as well. It is the same reason why you do not include your age or birth date on a resume. Why can Dan Meyer get away with it? Because he is Dan Meyer. Point 4: No generic cover letters. Your revisions do not indicate that you have a spot where you are going to talk about the district or school's mission statement or beliefs. Do not send out the same cover letter to different schools. You can have a slot where you will change the wording; there is a high chance that most districts have similar statements anyway. I will be brutally honest: The issue with your cover letter is that it is all just a lot of fluff. You literally have not told me anything unique about yourself that sets you apart from others. This varies QUITE a bit with districts, but if I was reading a cover letter with a bunch of quotes and quasi-analyses of said quotes, I would be thinking, ""This person has absolutely nothing substantial to say."" If you feel the need to explicitly tell me how you feel and not what you did, you either do not have anything important to say (which obviously is not true based on your resume) or have no idea how to say it. I mean, you love working with kids? That is really nothing new. Every teacher you are up against does -- or will damn pretend it at the least. You are going to help students with technology? Well, duh. That is the way education is going. You HAVE to do that anyway. What TYPE of technology are you going to implement that will benefit the district and its students? &gt; Just like anything in life, a good support is needed in order to succeed. Education is one of the biggest building blocks to life. Students now no longer just understand the material but also get excited to learn. You told me nothing to make me believe that you are capable of doing this. If you tell me WHAT you did to make students feel excited to learn, then everything you said above is implied. Hell, you would not even NEED the above quote. I, your reader, would know by implication. &gt; Your cover letter needs to hook them so they hopefully look at your resume (and this is if you have made it past their online application filter process). Talking about what is already on your resume does not do this. I noticed you took out most of the information on your resume in your cover letter because of this comment, but you are misunderstanding what this poster meant. Your resume covers the basics of what you did to prepare yourself; your cover letter is used to expand on a particular set of incidents that will demonstrate to future employees why you are going to be a benefit. For example, my resume may state that I have worked in a middle school for x amount of years and helped pilot the 1-to-1 iPad implementation in my school, but my cover letter says that my students did a project in order to prepare them for the upcoming SBAC and state-wide tests that use iPads and computers. I told them that I was asked quite a bit to demonstrate iPad applications at staff meetings. I told them that having a teacher who is comfortable with iPads is beneficial because their students will need to be comfortable with technology anyway when they head to university or trade school or employment after high school. You need more concrete, real views and ideas in your cover letter. What you are saying you are going to do is much, much harder to prove. While you do not need to follow this formula, perhaps this will frame your thinking a bit more: * Par 1: The position you are interested in, a comment about the school's mission statement (I noticed with _____ that your district values ...) and why your experiences match those values. Pick one value or quality you have yourself (use of technology, etc.) and have that as your focal point to guide the rest of your letter. * Par 2-3: Preparation. What did you do to match this value the school holds highly? How is what you did going to actually benefit the school and its students whether presently or in the near future? * Par 4: A bit on your philosophy or what you see your students doing or what they are capable of (the answer to this is capable of anything so long as they have clear and high expectations). How will your teaching philosophy benefit your students and the world they will be living in? * Par 5: Wrap up.

Please allow my $0.02 USD ($1.51 CAD) If you do not want to pay more than fifty bucks but need an electric, I recommend the [Bostitch XACTO series](http://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-Teacher-Electric-Sharpener-SmartStop/dp/B001PMG98O/ref=pd_sim_op_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1Q7AVA00VJ834555KT3X). The great thing about it is that it has a blue light that comes on when the pencil is adequately sharpened. Great for middle schoolers who know someone is going to watch them sharpen the pencil and go ""OOOH IT IS BLUE AND YOU DID NOT STOP"" if they do not pay attention. The downside to it is that you have to be very conscious about shaving piling up. The motor can jam very easily if shavings get in there. For the price, it is pretty solid. If you want the sharpener to end all sharpeners, go with the [Bostitch MPS1](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-Bostitch-MPS1BLK-Antimicrobial-Sharpener/dp/B004E2OALA/ref=sr_1_3?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412907248&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=pencil+sharpener). *""But a manual?!""* I hear you cry... yes, a manual.

Middleschoolteachers,"I was your age when I started teaching secondary (younger, I taught elementary overseas) but in a similar situation (except female). I am in my 30s now, and kids and parents still ask - even though I have been at the same school for awhile - if it is my first year teaching sometimes because I look so young. Just got that from the few parents who came to parent-teacher night and my 6th pd. class (one of whom I taught last year and who set them straight for me). I do not think it hindered me or would hinder you. I do not even always dress up (though first year, that is a good tip anyway, just for the confidence level and extra boost since you are learning management). I dress kind of cute and weird (a lot of my clothes are from Japan - leggings and poofy skirts and all kinds of weird, young-ish things, because I like them; not a lot of Ann Taylor for me, and I also wear jeans and such sometimes too). I work at a tough school (Title 1 middle school, 8th grade, lots of ESE/ESOL, gangs in the area, rough kids), and my management is excellent now - some of that is practice, but it only really took me a year to get it down pat, and everyone has a rough first year if they teach in the kind of schools and positions I am used to. Management is really WAY less about appearance than people think. I have taught HS too - 8th and 11th are my main experience levels, though I have touched on 7th, 9th, 3rd, and Kindergarten. Even though I teach 8th now, there are so many kids that are behind at my school, I teach lots of 15 and 16 year olds too. I have a new colleague who is in her late 40s with little teaching experience and none at schools like mine before this year; she is very dressy, much more so than me, and always looks put together. She looks like a businesswoman; I look like a young bohemian. Her management is a joke. Kids literally threw away textbooks in her room, they curse at her and each other, they walk out, they do not do work, they do not listen - even sometimes our good Advanced kids. She is pulling her hair out. (People are trying to help her, we are not trying to let her drown, but she just cannot relate to the kids.) Lately, they are changing schedules, and I get kids from her room that really push it too far and get kicked out, and they do everything I ask most of the time. Looking or being older or dressing professionally is not going to really impact management with any of the kids you actually need management with. Appearance matters a lot more with parents and colleagues than with the kids, and then it is more about presentation (how you dress) than your age. Management is about 1) relationships, 2) consistency, 3) communication, 4) controlling your own emotions, 5) organization, and 6) projecting confidence. If you have good experience relating to kids, that is a great start. The last thing I would worry about is how you look. Kids really care about lots of things way more than that.",age started teaching secondary younger taught overseas similar situation except female kid parent still ask even though awhile first year teaching sometimes look young got parent came parent teacher night the ad class one taught last year set straight think hindered would hinder even always dress though first year good tip anyway confidence level extra boost since learning management dress kind cute weird lot clothes japan legging poofy skirt kind weird young ish thing like lot ann taylor also wear jean sometimes work tough title the grade lot ese sol gang area rough kid management excellent practice really took year get pat everyone rough first year teach kind school position used management really way le appearance people think taught i the the main experience level though touched the the red kindergarten even though teach the many kid behind teach lot year old new colleague late little teaching experience none school like mine year dressy much always look put together look like businesswoman look like young bohemian management joke kid literally threw away textbook room curse walk work listen even sometimes good advanced kid pulling hair people trying help trying let drown cannot relate kid lately changing schedule get kid room really push far get kicked everything ask time looking older dressing professionally going really impact management kid actually need management appearance matter lot parent colleague kid presentation dress age management relationship consistency communication controlling emotion organization projecting confidence good experience relating kid great start last thing would worry look kid really care lot thing way,secondary younger taught similar female first young last straight first good extra cute weird young ish wear jean tough ese excellent first le main red many old new late little teaching mine much businesswoman young bohemian good advanced hair drown relate kid older impact need good great last

I would give them 3+4 jumping jacks and wait for them all to give me a thumbs up and then, as a class, tell me the answer.

So in the bowl for math equations you can have the kids even make up appropriate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division problems with a answer less than 100 let us say. But also instruct them not to write the answer on the paper. Then on another paper you or they or even you as a class, can think of exercises. Then you can take them outside, tell them to spread out and start the game. Have them go up one by one taking a slip of paper and an exercise.

Middleschoolteachers,"Almost none of my colleagues got Social Studies jobs in high school when we finished - a bunch did middle school, several were out of subject area - one got a special education position, e.g. Now, maybe four years out, more people have managed to move into subject area and/or grade level. If the only thing you are willing to teach in terms of age group and subject is high school Social Studies, and you do not want to spend time in middle school or doing English, then you may have a hard time getting the position you want. Plus, in California, Social Studies is fairly broadly defined: history, ancient to modern, world and US, psychology, geography, civics, economics and ethnic studies. With high school social studies, you have no guarantee that you will not get a subject that you are not very familiar with. When I did my student teaching, I almost got economics, which I really did not want. LAUSD has passed something recently to push towards ethnic studies mandatory for high school graduation. If you eventually want to teach college, think really carefully about whether you want to do academia and research - because AFAIK that is what will determine if a four year school will hire you.

Middleschoolteachers,"""Pull out"" is a command we use in band classrooms from the very first band class in middle school. It means to pull out a part of the tubing slightly (tuning slide), because all of your notes are too high. Kids learn the sexual meaning later on, and we ride ride it out. Damn near everything in band is a sex joke (tounge harder, grip lower, gentle fingers, moisten lips, no teeth), so this stuff is always just under the surface for the dirty minded kids/teachers. I had paused a rehearsal to correct some tuning. Discovered all of the sousaphones had their tuning slides pushed all of the way in. I said ""Playing loud on Sousaphone tends to make it go sharp, so when in doubt.......use a longer tuning sli--"" During that pause, all of the brass players completed the original sentence in their heads. When they could smell my fear, and sense my retreat to other words, they attacked. As one, my brass boys and girls all shouted ""WHEN IN DOUBT PULL OUT!""",pull command use band classroom first band class mean pull part tubing slightly tuning slide note kid learn sexual meaning later ride ride damn near everything band sex joke tounge harder grip lower gentle finger moisten lip teeth stuff always surface dirty minded kid teacher paused rehearsal correct tuning discovered sousaphone tuning slide pushed way said playing loud sousaphone tends make go sharp doubt use longer tuning sli pause brass player completed original sentence head could smell fear sense retreat word attacked one brass boy girl shouted doubt pull,band sexual gentle lip sousaphone loud sharp original fear
Middleschoolteachers,"When I was a student teacher, teaching at a middle school. We had a rainy day schedule, which means all PE classes are in the gym. So about 130 students sitting in a gym, the teachers would usually say ""mouths shut, eyes on me!"" To get the attention of a large group. When it was my period to lead the students I tried to copy their saying but instead said, ""eyes shut, mouths on me!"" As soon as I said it, I realized what I did.

Middleschoolteachers,"&gt;I have been in my union for 3 years. I originally joined for job protection, just in case. Last year, my union president transferred from the elementary school to teach at the middle school. From what I have heard from other teachers, she had an issue with the special education teacher at the elementary school so she came to the middle school with a vendetta against me, the special education teacher. I was never anything but kind and accommodating to her. If she asked me to do something, I would do it. When she insisted that I create activities for her lowest RTI group, I did it, even though she never once did any of the planned activities. When she wanted me or the special ed assistant to cover her class so she could run errands, we did. If this is true, why? Why did you cover for her? Why did you never say anything to her? &gt;I later learned that she documented anything she perceived that I was doing wrong. How did you learn this information? &gt;My principal called me to her office one day and said I was being written up. The union president was present. Her reasons for the write up were a list of things the teacher felt I was doing wrong. ""You were 11 minutes late on [such date] getting to her classroom."" God forbid, I had to use the restroom that day. (The IEPs at my school are written in a way that is against normal policies. Every single minute of my day was put into IEPs, saying that I needed to be in certain classrooms for the entire length of the periods. In reality, there were not even enough minutes in a work day to actually follow the IEPS.) It was a list of similar complaints. Then, my principal said, ""This is your third write up."" I replied, ""Uh, no, this is only the second."" She then said, ""Actually, I never told you about the second one. But I will need you to go ahead and sign both of them now."" I thought I had no other option, seeing as how my union ""rep"" was present but had not defended me. Regardless of anything else, you stop the meeting. You have the right to choose your own representation. The administration may have gone to the President because they were available, however if they are the ones bringing these accusations up it is a clear conflict of interest. Find someone else, someone you trust, to bring in to that meeting. &gt;I talked to a few other teachers afterwards and they agreed that my union rep was not there to defend me, she was there to condemn me. Which is why you need to stress that you should have had other representation there. &gt;This year, I decided to quit the union. I am a little nervous that I made the wrong choice, but I also feel like my union is not there to protect me. I feel like I paid more than $700 a year for someone to attack me. Some people have told me that I need to stay in the union. It is your local, not the county, not the state, not the national. Your local president did this to you (for what reasons, I am not sure. Truth is a three-edged sword). &gt;I am wondering what reasons people have for joining/staying in the teachers union. Honestly, I am a union officer in my local. I joined originally because I was new. That was 13 years ago. I have stayed because I have had to rely on my union for protection years ago when I had a colleague come gunning for me. It did not go the same way yours went. I have stayed because they only real way to effect change is to remain involved. I saw some things that I was unhappy with within my union, so I got involved. I became a building representative and rose to an officer's position. I stay because in this day and age it is easy for a career to be ruined by words, not actions. It is easy to be accused of something and have no one there to back you up. That is what your union is for. TLDR: My union president came after me, unprovoked, and I feel like I am paying to not be supported. Should I rejoin the union or just save my money?

Middleschoolteachers,"8th grades Social Studies teacher here....as far as the kids go I think the most important thing that you can do is to treat the kids like humans. You do not have to talk down to kids, you can command respect while still being kind. Also, be sure to remind yourself often how hard being a middle school aged kid is. It helps to keep that in mind the your are dealing with middle school knucklehead behavior. As far as teaching social studies goes I try to keep my lessons as interesting and relevant as possible. If I can connect something to current events or real life situations I do. The awesome thing about social studies is that while we have to teach certain objectives, we can make the lessons our own since we are not subjected to standardized tests. I save everything!

Middleschoolteachers,"Have you volunteered in k-12 or substituted before? If you are really uncertain what level or subject that can be a good way to help decide. I knew I was not meant for K when I came home from my first day subbing in K. The younger your students are, the better at teaching and management you need to be. It is easier to start with younger students and become a good teacher and move older than vice versa. So if you are really undecided, doing elementary and then adding authorizations by taking the corresponding csets and methods course/s is not a bad way to do it. I added authorization, so I have two single subject credentials. Doing elementary can also lead to teaching in either blocks (English and Social Studies together or Math and Science together) in middle school. At sufficiently needy schools, you may be able to get a single subject job anyway.

Middleschoolteachers,"Hi. I need to put a disclaimer that I am not a teacher yet-- I am going into my fourth year. I attended a few CSET workshops at my CSU school recently, so I am knee deep in this stuff. What you heard about the situation on the ground with lack of job postings at the secondary level is true, at least from hearsay. Both friends and faculty have attested to it. The fact really is that English &amp; Social Science jobs are the hottest jobs to get in K-12. I will say, however, that you cannot think about things like that. I am not necessarily a person that believes in fate... But you never know when a job posting will open up for you, and you will be the right person for it. That said, going the multiple subject route is probably the way to go. You have to pass an exam called the RICA which is supposedly a beast. It is heavy on linguistics content. And of course, the CSETs. I have since learned that with a multiple subject credential, one can teach at the middle school level, provided you took a 'block' i.e. English and Social Science. And finally, if you still want the high school English job, then all you have to do is pass the English CSET (heh, easier said then done) and go back to school once more for a single methods course to add on. No additional internship needed if you already have one credential. I have a friend right now is pursuing a high school credential (decided elementary was not for him), and he explained that his methods course was a cake walk, and had he had to do the internship in the high school subject, it would have so much more difficult. This is heavily anecdotal--I cannot substantiate it myself--but from rumblings like those, it seems that single subject internships are tougher than elementary ones. Again, this is probably heavily situational.

Middleschoolteachers,"One of my professors told us to do this- she called it punk rock teaching. Forget all of the nonsense the school requires and just teach the kids what they need to know, in the best way that works for her and the students. That might be project based learning. It might be student led lessons and research. The other thing that professor told me was not to let 12 year olds (I teach middle school) dictate my mood. it took about half of a school year for that to really make sense to me. I could not keep taking home whatever mood they had thrust upon me with their behavior or problems or whatever. Do I still care about my students and feel heartbroken when they do not do well or I learn some new horrible thing about their home lives? Absolutely. But I do my best to leave it at work. I have a routine at the end of my work day that helps me to mentally switch from 'teacher' to 'normal human'. I cannot carry all of that with me, or I would burn out within a week. If I were you, I would encourage her to take some time to be a normal human and not just a teacher. Prep her lunches. Start doing crock pot dinners so neither of you have to worry about cooking when you get home from a long taxing day. Remind her that she can only guide and teach and encourage her students- she cannot make them learn against their will. If she is making every effort to remediate a student and nothing is changing, that is all she can do. I have one girl that refuses to turn in work. She is the smartest girl I teach, but she is failing my class because she literally will not turn in any work.

The biggest thing holding me back from inviting guest speakers into my classroom is that I do not know for sure exactly what they plan to do. It is important to me if I give you my classroom that you actually engage the kids and cover the content that is in the standards. I have had speakers who were very nice but too quiet and meek for middle schoolers. I have had a speaker who had a great idea that was perfect for illustrating the content but involved an activity with spoons and beans where kids had to listen carefully and then go crazy for a bit and then stop and listen again... I ended up having to work my butt off to maintain discipline and clean up afterwards (which would have been fine but I had not prepared to do this in advance). Yet another speaker was very knowledgeable but prepared a college level PowerPoint that just had my kids totally lost. Basically what I am getting at is, please share every detail of your speaker presentations with the teacher in advance. I would highly suggest sending it directly to the media specialist / librarian, or possibly the math coach or literacy coach (I think most school websites should have these staff listed).",hi science teacher grade thought biggest thing holding back inviting guest speaker classroom know sure exactly plan important give classroom actually engage kid cover content standard speaker nice quiet meek schoolers speaker great idea perfect illustrating content involved activity spoon bean kid listen carefully go crazy bit stop listen ended work butt maintain discipline clean afterwards would fine prepared advance yet another speaker knowledgeable prepared college level powerpoint kid totally lost basically getting please share every detail speaker presentation teacher advance would highly suggest sending directly medium specialist librarian possibly math coach literacy coach think website staff listed,biggest important give kid content standard nice quiet great content involved crazy stop discipline clean prepared knowledgeable prepared medium librarian math website

Middleschoolteachers,"My class is mostly reading instruction, essay composition, and a small amount of research and grammar; I use literature as a means to those ends, not as the end in itself. I think building reading stamina with rich, authentic texts is really important in the middle grades, rather than just learning to master the easy answers and short lessons found in basal readers. I would also like to see a stronger focus on grammar and punctuation during middle school than what currently occurs in my district, along with a higher standard for proper letter formation in handwriting. Its really, really hard to get a 14-18-year-old to stop putting random capital letters in their writing, or to stop drawing lowercase Bs like plus signs, or to put full spaces between their words, or to remember to use apostrophes for possessives, if they have not been held accountable for those things in a long time (if ever) - they want to argue that these things do not matter, because their prior teachers, and teachers in other subjects areas, do not prioritize it. I think its easier to teach good habits when they are younger than it is to un-teach bad ones in high school. But most of my ninth graders come in with little skill in all of these areas, and we work through it regardless. I know MS/JH teachers are doing the best they can, just like the rest of us.

Things like capitalization and punctuation are still issues with my students. I just wish I could get my 8th graders to try. Many of them are still concrete but the helplessness and apathy with the knowledge they will go on to high school and middle school grades do not matter is frustrating at times.

Middleschoolteachers,"Hey that is my area! Early intervention is ESSENTIAL for student success if the student is struggling. The biggest thing I like about RTI models is that it stresses continual changes to groupings - if Student A is really having a hard time with oral fluency, then that student is put into my fluency group and for several weeks that is ALL we do. Student A can then test out. An effective RTI model can really help more students because the groupings can change every few weeks. You have to be careful with RTI though because it stresses a magic pill way of thinking - If I can just fix Student Bs informational text comprehension then everything will be okay again! Reading is not like that, there is many processes occurring at the same time to lead to understanding and you cannot isolate one and expect it to be the magic solution. I teach at a 5, 6, 7 middle school and we have five reading teachers in our school, of which I am one. When we were doing our initial round of assessments and data combing and grouping, it was very clear that A LOT of students needed our help, but due to limits of our schedules and not enough people, some kids who could really use a semester of reading intervention do not qualify. I really think we could increase our test barriers to the lowest 32-35% of students instead of capping at 25%, and have three interventionists per grade level. Right now we have one interventionist doing all of 7th, do not tell me that is enough, its definitely not. We need more specialists and we need them at ALL levels of K-12.

Middleschoolteachers,"This is more specific to 7th graders, but the students I work with seem to have a hard time taking ownership for their education. Maybe it is something about the transition from elementary to middle school, but they tend to expect the teacher to tell them every little thing to do, and are afraid to do anything on their own because they do not want to do it ""wrong."" It can be paralyzing for some students if they are not told exactly what to do point for point, and often results in incomplete or missing homework.

At the end of the year, it did in fact turn into a full-time position, and I had to interview for it again and seemingly thought it was a formality, because I had done everything right and by the books, but they gave it to some fucking loser with a PE degree who took the praxis so he could teach social studies and coach wrestling.

Middleschoolteachers,"Administration at ALL levels (school, district, state, and federal) need to nix social promotion for good. Instead of social promotion, we need serious tiered support for our struggling students and, in upper grades, tracked paths for students who continue to not show an interest in advancing their academic studies and would rather study a trade/vocational discipline. In my district, students can be held back twice: once in elementary school, and once in middle school. Not in high school. I teach the inaugural year at my middle school and most of the kids come in as complete messes. While a little bit of transitional struggle is expected, I was stunned to find out that out of my 105 kids, 20 were socially promoted--and I am sure these numbers are much higher in other areas. Social promotion does nothing to help these students. By the time they come to me, they already assume that they are going to be passed on forever. In high school, several of them drop out or just barely pass 12th grade and then have extreme difficulty finding work. It is ridiculous.

Middleschoolteachers,"The biggest problem with education is that we are still using a model from the 1800s, BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER. That is why we still have up to 34 kids to 1 teacher in most classrooms. Because it is CHEAP. That is also why most teachers are female. If more men were in the profession they would demand higher pay and fewer hours of work at home. (They have already demanded that by not being the in profession and choosing more lucrative professions that provide them with more down-time after work and more camaraderie with colleagues.) How to fix this? Maybe all schools starting in 1st grade should have class periods with specialists? The kids go from room to room, switching every hour or two. Two hours for LA, 90 minutes for math, 90 minutes for science, 150 minutes spread through the week for music and art, and 2 hours a week on social studies and history. (I am shorting SS and history only because there is not enough hours in the week.) Why would this work? Because teachers would no longer have to prep for 5 or 6 subjects in the day. They would just have to worry about one. They could become experts. HOWEVER, this also means we need smaller class sizes. 20 max, in K-12. WHY? Because for all but high-income families, being a kid in America today is HARD. 1 out of every 4 or 5 kids lives in poverty with all the insecurity and mayhem that brings. I think it is about 50% that are being raised in single parent households now. Kids lives SUCK in many ways these days. The system designed in the 1800s was built on small-town life, two parent families with one parent home most of the day to handle emergencies. Plus, in the 1800s, basic RESPECT of adults was taught at home. Those teachings, or respecting your place in the pecking order of a school, flew out the window starting in the 1980s. NO ONE respects teachers anymore, and respecting teachers is not taught in many homes. So if the kids are not learning social skills and respect at home, that teaching duty falls to the schools. Elementary teachers spend hours and hours every year teaching little kids how to function in society. That is the MAIN reason classes should never be more than 20 - so kids can be a part of a large family during the day, to learn this stuff, and not just a face lost in the crowd. Same with middle school and high school - no more than 20 per class, to meet their emotional and maturation needs. ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY. The federal government is like a Deadbeat Dad who does not want to pay. So then, because we do not fix all these issues early, Deadbeat Dad gets to be employed by the local prison, where all his failed children wind up. Oh, and one easy fix that also costs MONEY - every school with more than 500 kids should have at least one full-time counselor, and every school district should have at least one full-time child psychologist on staff to supervise and advise all the counselors.",biggest problem education still using model cheaper still kid teacher classroom cheap also teacher female men profession would demand higher pay fewer hour work home already demanded profession choosing lucrative profession provide time work camaraderie colleague fix maybe school starting it grade class period specialist kid go room room switching every hour two two hour la minute math minute science minute spread week music art hour week social study history shorting i history enough hour week would work teacher would longer prep subject day would worry one could become expert however also mean need smaller class size max i income family kid america today hard every kid life poverty insecurity mayhem brings think raised single parent household kid life suck many way day system designed built small town life two parent family one parent home day handle emergency plus basic respect adult taught home teaching respecting place pecking order flew window starting one respect teacher anymore respecting teacher taught many home kid learning social skill respect home teaching duty fall school teacher spend hour hour every year teaching little kid function society main reason class never kid part large family day learn stuff face lost crowd per class meet emotional maturation need cost money federal government like deadbeat dad want pay fix issue early deadbeat dad get employed local prison failed child wind oh one easy fix also cost money every kid least one full time counselor every district least one full time child psychologist staff supervise advise counselor,biggest cheaper female higher fewer lucrative grade minute social i prep subject expert smaller i hard single many small basic many social little kid main large stuff crowd emotional federal early local child oh easy least full least full child psychologist

I had to teach physics to students that could not add at the same time I had to teach students who spent their mornings travelling to the high school to take math classes at a higher level than what we could offer in our school. Part of a school's success is measured by how much they discipline students. Which does not mean we use more effective behavior management, it means we just do not actually discipline anyone for anything less than a felony, so the numbers of suspensions looks great when the board is looking at their terrible school success metrics. We pull the kid out of class for 5 minutes give him/her a stern talking to, and send them right back to the class where they continue stopping any learning from happening. I have literally had kids fight in class, throw chairs, etc... and you think they are suspended, but what is actually happening is that the admin tells the parent to call them out of school for a few days so they are still out of school, but it is not adding to their behavior statistics.",teach taught the grade science ish kid class tested everywhere it grade college level reader teach physic student could add time teach student spent morning travelling take math class higher level could offer part success measured much discipline student mean use effective behavior management mean actually discipline anyone anything le felony number suspension look great board looking terrible success metric pull kid class minute give stern talking send right back class continue stopping learning happening literally kid fight class throw chair etc think suspended actually happening admin tell parent call day still adding behavior statistic,ish physic teach higher much effective le great terrible metric stern fight behavior

Be positive in all of your interactions.

Middleschoolteachers,"I teach middle school (6-8) special ed in a rural title one school. My go-to is live school. It is kind of like class dojo on steroids, and kids can spend their points on rewards of your choosing. (ex: 25 points is a small snack, like a small bag of chips or cookies, 100 points is a large snack like a candy bar or pop tarts, etc.). You can also choose what they earn points for and how much each thing is worth (1 pt for coming to school, 5 points for turning in hw, 25 points for completing an IXL lesson, 100 points for a perfect test score, etc.). The middle school as a whole participates in ""stamp sheets"". Kids can earn one stamp for each period, usually for a period of about two weeks. If they make the goal, I think usually 75-80% of the total stamps possible, they get to participate in ""stamp sheet reward""... The week of stamp sheet reward, student body government reps will ask for ideas (usually we end up with some variation of water play, arts and crafts, tech zone, movie, sports, however we are open to other ideas as long as they are reasonable) and the staff decides the final 5. Students who made their goal sign up for an activity and during the last elective period of that week (so usually friday 1:15-2:15) kids go to what they signed up for. If they did not make their goal, they are in what is called ""staybacks"", which is essentially a study hall. I also have an RTI period that is EXTREMELY difficult to manage (it is 15-20 special ed kids, grades 6-8), who are all working on different assignments. For that block I usually write their names and assignments on the board, along with what they need to accomplish during the block. Once they accomplish their personal goal, I cross their name off but they must continue working on SOMETHING academic (could be homework for another class, reading, etc) until everyone gets their name crossed off the board, and then they may have free time for the rest of the period. It is an all-or-nothing kind of strategy, but it motivates even my laziest kids because they do not want everyone else to be mad at them, lol. I also call parents A LOT. I am lucky because most of my parents, if they will not answer the phone, will at least respond to texts. And I do this for good things as well as bad things-- Hey, Johnny made 25% growth on his recent test! Or ""I just wanted to let you know that Suzy really put forth her best effort in reading today and made some really insightful comments, I would love to see this continue!"". It is gotten to the point where the kids know I am going to call and have started telling on themselves, and will often be more harsh than I was going to be. Example: On thursday lunch, I had two kids get into a ""scuffle""-- it was not a fight, per se, no punches were thrown, but it was physical, so I had to call both parents. When I called the 2nd parent, she told me her son had already told her the whole story, and how he knows he made a mistake and he is very remorseful and upset that he will not be able to apologize to the other kid until after winter break. (I am sure it will be forgotten by the time that rolls around though). I know this is not doable for everyone in every situation, but really investing in making parents a part of the school community has made a huge difference for me. It does not work for every kid, I still have an 8th grade girl who is single father has not come to a single meeting or returned a single call, text, or note. Lucky for me she is a good kid who just struggles academically. But do not get disheartened if this does not work right away or as well as I have described. I have certainly worked at schools where it was pretty much a lost because and it just seems daunting and exhausting. At that point, you have to make a judgement call. Do you need the documentation for administration? for failing grades? To CYA? If so, push through. Reward yourself with a piece of candy every time. Do what you got to do. I also make it a point to show kids that I appreciate them for who they are. I have made it VERY clear that my room is a safe-space if you just need to talk about life, if you need help with other classes, etc. My room is open 90% of the time during lunches, recesses, before school, after school. Sometimes I am exhausted and I just need to close the door and either chill or get work done, but the kids are pretty understanding of that. I have a little following of non-sped kids that hang out in my room and help me with stuff, or ask for help in their classes. Sometimes I ask kids to hang back just to talk about how their lives are going. Some are into this, some clam up and I send them on their way. I use a TON of humor. I am naturally a really snarky, sarcastic person. I never try to make kids feel bad about themselves, but I am quick with the sarcastic comebacks and middle schoolers are weird so we jam with it. ""Misssssssss, this assignment is so extra!"" ""Marissa, quit being extra and do your work."" I usually give a pointed stare and raise an eyebrow as I take a sip of my tea. The class, including Marissa, thinks its hilarious, and she gets to work. I also tell them a lot of funny, exaggerated stories about myself. Like, I fully intend to tell them that I was so exhausted when I was leaving school thursday that I fell UP the stairs to my apartment. I will be honest, I thought this book was a crock of shit when I first started teaching and was overwhelmed and felt like no one understood me, and I do not use any of the strategies it describes verbatim, but I have since taken a lot of inspiration from Teach Like a Champion.",teach special ed rural title one go live kind like class dojo steroid kid spend point reward choosing ex point small snack like small bag chip cook point large snack like candy bar pop tart etc also choose earn point much thing worth it coming point turning he point completing ill lesson point perfect test score etc whole participates stamp sheet kid earn one stamp period usually period two week make goal think usually total stamp possible get participate stamp sheet reward week stamp sheet reward student body government rep ask idea usually end variation water play art craft tech zone movie sport however open idea long reasonable staff decides final student made goal sign activity last elective period week usually friday kid go signed make goal called starbucks essentially study hall also rti period extremely difficult manage special ed kid grade working different assignment block usually write name assignment board along need accomplish block accomplish personal goal cross name must continue working something academic could homework another class reading etc everyone get name crossed board may free time rest period nothing kind strategy motivates even laziest kid want everyone else mad lol also call parent lot lucky parent answer phone least respond text good thing well bad thing hey johnny made growth recent test wanted let know suzy really put forth best effort reading today made really insightful comment would love see continue gotten point kid know going call started telling often harsh going example thursday lunch two kid get scuffle fight per se punch thrown physical call parent called and parent told son already told whole story know made mistake remorseful upset able apologize kid winter break sure forgotten time roll around though know doable everyone every situation really investing making parent part community made huge difference work every kid still the grade girl single father come single meeting returned single call text note lucky good kid struggle academically get disheartened work right away well described certainly worked school pretty much lost seems daunting exhausting point make judgement call need documentation administration failing grade cya push reward piece candy every time got also make point show kid appreciate made clear room safe space need talk life need help class etc room open time lunch recess sometimes exhausted need close door either chill get work done kid pretty understanding little following non sped kid hang room help stuff ask help class sometimes ask kid hang back talk life going clam send way use ton humor naturally really snarky sarcastic person never try make kid feel bad quick sarcastic comeback schoolers weird jam miss assignment extra marissa quit extra work usually give pointed stare raise eyebrow take sip tea class including marissa think hilarious get work also tell lot funny exaggerated story like fully intend tell exhausted leaving thursday fell stair apartment honest thought book crock shit first started teaching overwhelmed felt like one understood use strategy describes verbatim since taken lot inspiration teach like champion,special ed rural live spend ex small small large earn much ill lesson perfect etc whole stamp total possible participate stamp stamp reward end open reasonable final last elective friday signed rti difficult special ed different assignment name assignment accomplish accomplish personal academic rest laziest mad call lucky least good bad recent best insightful harsh thursday scuffle physical whole remorseful upset able break sure forgotten know doable parent huge single single single lucky good disheartened worked much grade clear safe open understanding little clam ton snarky sarcastic bad quick sarcastic miss extra extra sip marissa hilarious funny exaggerated stair honest overwhelmed

When I moved to a new school for my middle school years, some kids entered pre-algebra and a literature course, and other kids entered courses below that level. Do well, and students could leave middle school with algebra completed, while other students entered high school needing to take algebra. My own kids are in a small K-8 school without differentiated learning. So the only thing within the school that matters is whether they progress to the next grade level. In the transition to high school, incoming students from my kids' K-8 school are placed into high school courses based on teacher recommendation.

Middleschoolteachers,"I love middle school and I have taught 7th grade for 10+ years. I genuinely enjoy 7th grade, believe it or not. There is some joy to seeing kids come in this moldable hot mess and see them exit as young adults. But holy shit this year's 7th grade is a hot ass mess. And I mean a million times worse than any group of 7th graders I have had before. It is not a behavior thing as my classroom management is on point. This group of 7th graders just does not seem to get how to function independently. I chalk it up to one key - I am one of the first people in their lives whose ever told them no. Whether it is the no you cannot do that, no that behavior is not okay for the classroom or no half-assed work is not acceptable and I am not just going to give you 100% on it, that no seems to leave them shook. I am starting to wonder if there is something with kids of this age all around. At this point the 7th grade is usually moving towards independence and the group I have right now just tried an independent assignment and about 20% of them got what they had to do right.

There are few souls cut out for teaching 7th grade who actually LIKE that age level, and those people are crazy and talented and should be left to do what they will (in terms of curriculum) with the 7th graders and given nothing but praise and medals, in my book. I taught 8th grade for years and did fine/enjoyed it. I had to do a few years in 7th and hated it so much. I currently teach 10th and its delightful. At my old middle school, we used to call 7th grade ""the lost year"" for awhile. Then, I heard an actual NPR segment on how at a certain growth stage/age (which usually corresponds with 7th grade for most kids) kids are literally incapable of learning due to the frequency and amount of rapid neural and physical changes hormones and such are creating in their brains and bodies.

Middleschoolteachers,"your unconditional support really does mean so much. I finally made the time today since it was early dismissal and last day until Jan, to reach out for mental health services. Unfortunately I struggled with anxiety/depression in college, have done tons of natural healing lifestyle things and have been unpleasantly surprised to see that those 8-year old feelings are coming back. Pretty sure I have had anxiety attacks before while teaching, just undetectable to most, if that makes sense. I did have to stop and lean against the counter with the dizziness, blurred vision, rapid heartbeat and more. A student was talking about something at the board so there was not direct attention on me, but still. I could not think, just be stopped by sensations. Anyway. Granted of my 5 classes the'yre not all terrible. one period has 99% fabulous days...only 5 kids, advanced. The rest are one day cute and motivated, one day heartless and non-stop interrupting. (This is middle school). I do not know why but it is my 2nd period that (for the past 2 weeks) has been stuck on my mind as well as incredibly infuriating, hurtful. not sure if it is cuz a bad rep kid got switched in 2 weeks ago (and he does enjoy finding anything to insult me on while snickering to peers, who instantly became loyal to this tiny guy...senseless stuff, just for the sake of..whatever his motive is...) but... These guys are passive to the point it is painful. The simply do not produce work. This is Spanish for nAtive speakers level one. You cannot pass without listening, speaking, reading, writing. Plain and simple. They do listen, but none of the rest. I put in tons of scaffolding and modeling but when it comes their turn they literally just sit there. The ""I Do, You Do"" is fine, but the ""We Do"" is nothing. Okay, 1 or 2 kids will silently write the answers but refuse to share out. How else can I do closure/feedback?!

I am in a classroom with an average of 30 students each period and the classroom itself is an old elementary classroom so its super small and not equipped for labs what so ever. I constantly have parents complaining that I am not doing enough and letting them know of due dates a head of time. I am an introvert so at the end of the day I am physically, mentally, and emotionally spent so I barely have time to plan anything in advanced because I need to recharge. People keep telling me to look for pre-made units, but those are only good if you have time to go through all of them, read them entirely, and have enough time to prep the materials they require. I have clinical depression and to be honest, I am not sure if I will make it to 2019. There really are no other jobs for me to switch to. I have been hunting for full-time employment for 5 years and this is the first full-time job I have gotten since graduating college. I am a wreck. So I completely understand your frustration.

Middleschoolteachers,"Yes I felt like that many times. My concern and affection for my students kept me coming back. I taught middle school and it was not easy. Things that helped me were: taking a mental health/sick day, having educational videos on Fridays or Mondays, having a ""student exchange"" agreement with another teacher where I could send them a student and they could send me one if the student was out of control and disrupting the class, and finally having fresh coffee after work, by purchasing a coffee maker to have at school.",yes felt like many time concern affection student kept coming back taught easy thing helped taking mental health sick day educational video friday monday student exchange agreement another teacher could send student could send one student control disrupting class finally fresh coffee work purchasing coffee maker,many taught easy mental sick educational fresh
Middleschoolteachers,"Thanks for the suggestions. I know I am not there to be their friend, but I have always hear that cracking down later in the year after coming on too soft can have some serious consequences for the student-teacher relationships. That is mostly what I meant. Where I struggle with some of this is that I am teaching abroad and there are 12 8th grade classes that all need to learn the same content at the same time. I am not even their only English teacher either -- I co-teach with several others. I will try to figure out something that works. I can see the look of frustration and boredom on the faces of the good ones and it breaks my heart. More consequences for sure, and I have already been trying to think of some prizes I can implement in the context of my school. Thanks for your answer.

Middleschoolteachers,"I passed right over this post until the edit. But I have to say it from a growth perspective; I was that kid. &amp;#x200B; I had a bad case of class clown disease in school, but it was not because I wanted an adversarial relationship with my teacher. It was because I was not getting validation for things like being quiet, doing my work, staying on task, getting high marks, etc... Kids that disrupt your class often do it because they are getting validation from it that they are not getting elsewhere or for other actions. Obviously home life plays a big part (if parents are reinforcing positive behaviors at home the child is psychologically wired to seek praise over punishment), but for those kids often school is a way for them to seek that validation. I was a latchkey kid with two full-time working parents. I had internal motivations for doing well in school and began with that intention, but outwardly I noticed very early (second/third grade) that the ""bad"" kids got more attention from the teacher as well as the other students. I never made friends because I got the highest grade on the spelling test or went a week without a disciplinary intervention (name on the board, back then), but I definitely made friends after I threw a wet wad of tissue at the ceiling and it stuck there for two weeks. My teacher never paid attention to me when I sat quietly, but she paid attention when I created disruptions. Kids did not talk to me or invite me to their recess cliques when I was ""A Honor Roll"", but when I returned from suspension, the kids in the class all seemed to like me more and wanted to hear about how I got paddled by the principal. It sounds counterintuitive, but in the long run if you focus attentions on the good kids and ignore the bad ones the bad ones will begin to emulate the good ones. Every reaction you give the bad ones reinforces their behavior (even if you see it as punishment). It was not until I reached the back half of middle school before I had a teacher that did this and it turned me right 'round.",passed right post edit say growth perspective kid amp i i bad case class clown disease wanted adversarial relationship teacher getting validation thing like quiet work staying task getting mark etc kid disrupt class often getting validation getting elsewhere action obviously home life play big part parent reinforcing positive behavior home child psychologically wired seek praise punishment kid often way seek validation latchkey kid two full time working parent internal motivation well began intention outwardly noticed early second third grade bad kid got attention teacher well student never made friend got highest grade spelling test went week without disciplinary intervention name board back definitely made friend threw wet wad tissue ceiling stuck two week teacher never paid attention sat quietly paid attention created disruption kid talk invite recess clique honor roll returned suspension kid class seemed like wanted hear got paddled principal sound counterintuitive long run focus attention good kid ignore bad one bad one begin emulate good one every reaction give bad one reinforces behavior even see punishment reached back half teacher turned right round,right perspective bad adversarial validation quiet disrupt elsewhere big positive seek seek latchkey full internal intention early second third bad highest disciplinary wet wad invite wanted paddled principal counterintuitive long good bad bad good bad right
Middleschoolteachers,"Another perspective on this.....as the adoptive parent of two kids who were severely abused and traumatized and acted out in school and have attachment issues, as much as we wanted alternative placements for them it was very hard to get them, and, depending on the alternative placement, once the kid starts doing well the default is usually to send them back to the regular school. This happened to our daughter. Could not handle regular school, but did so well in a structured environment for a year and a half that we were heavily pressured to send her to the neighborhood middle school, which was too overstretched to give her the supportive services she needed. Due to school stress she started acting out at home again before she did at school so we were stuck with her there, even tho we told the school what was happening. This began a downward spiral where she was arrested at 12 for aggression at home, put into a treatment program where she was sexually assaulted at 14, and at 18 is pregnant, couch surfing and trying to finish her GED This is a loving, resilient girl but with a lot of trauma. Her brother had bad experience too ..we had to do a family move and rather than rely on the 500+ pages of records for his IEP saying he needed a special placement, the new district, as virtually all districts do, insisted that he be placed in the neighborhood highschool so they could assess for themselves, thereby guaranteeing hassle for teachers and other kids and guaranteeing a crash and burn for our emotionally vulnerable son. A year and a half later he finally got the placement he needed and now, almost a year after *that*, he is finally coming out of his depression and loves school and is letting his sweetness show again. And we are a family that has been praised multiple times for our skill in ""advocating"" and ""navigating the system."" We are white, educated, and middle class and so have all those unfair structural advantages, and the whole experience has still been a nightmare, and we get exhausted and have other stressors in our lives so we cannot always parent as well as we want. I can only begin to imagine how hard it can be for other special needs parents who do not have our resources. Another thing....finding out about alternative resources is very much on a need to know basis and sometimes not even that because school districts do not want everyone to ask for special treatment. Also they are mandated to be inclusive so they generally will not suggest an alternative placement even if they are desperate unless the parent beings it up first, which they cannot if they do not know about it. Imagine my surprise on learning that districts sometimes cover therapeutic boarding schools - that would have been by far a better solution for our daughter than having her arrested for freaking out but we did not know about it. (Because she had aged out / exhausted the children's mental health crisis resources) And behavioral needs are not always the parents fault - that is a huge oversimplification. We know birth parents who have ""that kid"" for reasons out of their control, like lead poisoning for example. But parenting difficult children also takes a huge toll so some people who might had done fine parenting an easy child are overwhelmed by the challenge of parenting a difficult one. Also, I say this with full love and appreciation for all the educators we have worked with. They were great. Heroic even. Our kids would not be doing as,well as,they are without them. It is the system that sucks.",another perspective adoptive parent two kid severely abused traumatized acted attachment issue much wanted alternative placement hard get depending alternative placement kid start well default usually send back regular happened daughter could handle regular well structured environment year half heavily pressured send neighborhood overstretched give supportive service needed due stress started acting home stuck even tho told happening began downward spiral arrested aggression home put treatment program sexually assaulted pregnant couch surfing trying finish ged loving resilient girl lot trauma brother bad experience family move rather rely page record pep saying needed special placement new district virtually district insisted placed neighborhood highschool could ass thereby guaranteeing hassle teacher kid guaranteeing crash burn emotionally vulnerable son year half later finally got placement needed almost year finally coming depression love letting sweetness show family praised multiple time skill advocating navigating system white educated class unfair structural advantage whole experience still nightmare get exhausted stressor life cannot always parent well want begin imagine hard special need parent resource another thing finding alternative resource much need know basis sometimes even district want everyone ask special treatment also mandated inclusive generally suggest alternative placement even desperate unless parent being first cannot know imagine surprise learning district sometimes cover therapeutic boarding school would far better solution daughter arrested freaking know aged exhausted child mental health crisis resource behavioral need always parent fault huge oversimplification know birth parent kid reason control like lead poisoning example parenting difficult child also take huge toll people might done fine parenting easy child overwhelmed challenge parenting difficult one also say full love appreciation educator worked great heroic even kid would well without system suck,adoptive abused acted attachment alternative hard alternative regular regular send give supportive due tho downward pregnant couch finish resilient bad special placement new crash vulnerable multiple white unfair structural whole nightmare stressor hard special alternative much ask special inclusive alternative desperate first imagine therapeutic boarding better exhausted mental behavioral huge difficult huge fine easy challenge difficult full great

Middleschoolteachers,"Rural middle school, ~230 kids in grades 6-8. Over half of the kids are low-income and get free or reduced lunch, and 95% of them ride the bus because the school is out in the middle of nowhere so they cannot walk to it. Because of that, having a kid after school for tutoring or a detention is pretty much not going to happen unless you set it up way in advance, and then you have to sit and wait with them to make sure the parent actually shows up to get them instead of thinking they will come on the bus like usual. Most of the kids have no college plans. Their folks are blue collar and that is what they plan on as well. Most, anyway. Some have plans to head to the cities when they graduate. I have small classes, 4 core classes with ~20 kids in each, and 2 electives with about the same. I like it.

Turns out several of middle school teachers use homework questions on quizzes (very lightly re-worded, if at all), then again on tests, and then again on the semester exams. I now spend a great deal of time on the syllabus, back-to-school night, and first days of school explaining that I do not ever reuse the same questions, that students need to study the original material and notes, not just their ""packets"" (i do not have words for how much i loathe that word), and then I give a whole lot of info about ways to study. It is not a matter of alignment, types of questions, etc. etc. for my kids, it is that they genuinely have no idea how to study and are essentially lost if they do not have the questions ahead of time.

The kids were rude, unmotivated, disrespectful, would curse me out daily, steal from me, call me names, throw things, it was the fucking worst. These students were truly the bottom of the barrel. I very much wanted to be the person who would not give up no matter how hard they pushed. But in the end, my role in their lives was very limited. The hour or so I saw them per day would never have even been enough to outweigh the influence of their home lives...their peers....etc. I hate to put it this way but some of these kids are already fucked. In middle school, they do not seem to care about anything.....do nothing but disrupt the classroom environment....constantly combative.....will not take direction....its over for them.

Are you a Praxis state? In my state you only need an original teaching license and you can add endorsements for other subjects by taking praxis. My certificate is k-12, so I only had to take the middle school math content one. However, if you do not have the same grade levels, you can take like both the content and pedagogy Praxis tests to meet that requirement. If you are going to get another teaching degree anyway, it would likely be beneficial to do something related to math education, however, having that certification may allow you to switch subjects now. My state was always in need of math teachers. I think teaching the subject while you learn about it in grad school can make grad school more effective in impacting your actual teaching.

Middleschoolteachers,"I have no recommendations for books but will happily share my experience. First, I am curious what level of buy-in will you have from your colleagues, admin, and district? That will define your experience. I am in a district that is moving 100% to SBG in an entirely top-down fashion, so my experience will be vastly different from someone who is moving to SBG in their own classroom out of their own genuine curiosity. I do not know how to distinguish between ""standards based grading"" and ""my own district's application of standards based grading,"" so forgive me if I say something that is specific to my district and needs additional context. Feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to follow up. In my district, we are moving to get to the point where all ages K12 will have their grades be entirely based on standards. In the elementary and middle schools, we are abolishing letter grades altogether, but in high school, we are keeping letter grades to maintain compatibility with the rest of the nation (but are pushing to have those grades be tied to standards instead of whatever a teacher may choose). We use the standard 4-tiered scale. The first thing is to learn that this is not a 4 *point* scale. Everyone wants to treat them as ""points"" which is wrong and frustrating to deal with. Correcting students' and parents' incorrect intuition will become your life. * Level 1: No mastery * Level 2: Partial mastery * Level 3: Meets expectations (the goal) * Level 4: Advanced/mastery Expect absolutely no buy-in from parents whatsoever. Especially if you are doing it on your own, make sure either (1) you are simply dipping your toes in the water and not upending the traditional grading model too much, or (2) you are an untouchable veteran teacher willing to make this the hill you die on. Grading is such a huge part of education, for better or for worse, and SBG rocks the boat well beyond an amount that gets the attention of every single parent and student. Expect very difficult conversations with every single kind, hard-working, straight-A student. We all have *tons* of straight-A students who are used to ""playing the game"" of schoolthey know how to turn work in on time, complete test corrections after their tests, resubmit assignments for additional points back, whatever. They are not used to being told that they are currently sitting at a level-3 understanding on a 4-level scale, representing that they have met expectations in a standard but have not reached mastery. They will interpret that to mean that they are being given a 75%, even though they did all of the work they have been asked to do, which they see as unfair. (Their entire educational career until that point has taught them the importance of ""playing the game"" which is the craft that they have mastered, so I have sympathy with themyes, it really is unfair.) When discussing SBG with colleagues, admin, or parents, expect for every single person to want to use the conversation as an opportunity to shoehorn in their own philosophy on grades, and expect everyone to be using different definitions of things and interpreting everything differently. Have you ever listened to two people discuss politics, and one person says ""socialism is bad, just look at Venezuela"" and the other person says ""socialism is good, just look at Finland,"" and you have thought to yourself ""um, I think you guys might be using two different definitions of the word 'socialism,' but that is none of my business?"" No one will have the same philosophical understanding of what a ""level 3"" is or what a ""level 4"" is. People will want to spend the bulk of the conversation talking about their own philosophies on grading instead of working towards a shared definition of what is meant by ""level 3"" or ""level 4."" If admin gets involved, expect clueless implementations that completely miss the point. I have had an administrator tell an entire school that all teachers *must* tie all grades directly to standards, and simultaneously tell an entire school that we *must* reduce the numbers of D's and F's. These are completely, 100% contradictory. A huge feature of SBG is that it takes grading decisions out of teachers' hands and ties it to more universal standards. The admin team literally ran reports of which teachers had the most F's and would confront them about it. &gt; &gt; Why do you have so many students on track to fail this quarter? &gt; &gt; Because I have adopted the standards and rubrics set forth by my department, and all of these students are objectively at a 'level 1' according to those rubrics. Maybe it is a terrible class, or maybe I am a bad teacher compared to my colleagues. Either way, these students are objectively at a 'level 1' (here are the assessments to prove it) and their performance is being assessed in the exact same way as other students, so even if it is a bit worrisome, it is at least fair and consistent which is a major goal/feature of SBG. &gt; &gt; &gt; You need to give fewer F's. That same admin team also unilaterally created a scale that said that a ""level 3"" should translate to a ""B,"" with no input from teachers or the community and with no consistency among other schools. This is a deep philosophical issue about what a grade *should* represent (if you have to have them at all); instead of being discussed at-length by all stakeholders, the answer was drafted up in an afternoon and thrown onto all teachers. There are many other philosophical discussions to be had, and none of them will be had. Expect to have difficulty with classroom behavior without being able to use grades as a carrot/stick, at least until you figure out a new paradigm. No extra credit, no participation points, no points off for late work. Philosophically it is perhaps not ideal to have to tie those things to a grade, but for better or for worse every teachers has managed student behavior by using their classroom grades. I AM GOING TO grades have historically been an important tool for teacher autonomy*you* get to pick *your* grading philosophy based on how *you* teach, how *you* assess, how *you* manage student behavior, etc. If there are new expectations thrown on you, your grading philosophy can be adjusted to incorporate the new stuff. But by tying grades to only standards, everything else about your teaching needs to find a new way to be enforced. If you cannot lower a student's homework score when they refuse to do homework, what are you going to do instead to motivate that student? Odds are it requires a cohesive approach from the entire school, or district, or community, and it *certainly* means you need admin or counseling to be on your side when you have an issue with a student. It also means much more work on your end. Instead of just lowering the kid's grade, you now need to loop in all the kid's other teachers, counseling, parents, etc. to find a new solution. Maybe that is a good thingit forces those types of issues to come to the forefront so that they can actually be addressed, but it requires an incomprehensible amount of time. I would estimate that the average teacher at our school spends maybe an hour peer week before/after school in intervention meetings with counselors/parents/admin/etc. to address things like a student's late work habit or whatever else. (Keep in mind we are talking about squeezing many meetings per week into short amounts of time before/after school, so any time you have a meeting that means you will not be getting anything else done that morning or afternoon. Do you ever make copies in the morning? Not anymore you do not.) It is a hell of a lot more time than we get per week to sit down with our PLCs. It is also just not as effective as simply giving partial credit for late work or giving a certain number of late passes per quarter or something. I think I am probably approaching the character limit so I will stop there. Overall my impression is quite negative on moving an entire district to it and I think it is a solution looking for a problem.

Middleschoolteachers,"Thank you for telling me about your experiences. It is very valuable to hear about it, and I find your perspective on teaching being more about the pedagogy than the content a good perspective to take even though I do not often think about it that way. Being in an elementary school really gave you new challenges and changed your perspective on literacy, and it made you able to work with many different varieties of students. As to why I do not want to do elementary, I value being able to teach in a way that allows the students to develop their ability to show insight into what they are learning and make new discoveries through the research and inquiry process. I want to go into depth about what we are covering and make the topics come alive to the students. I do not want to spend my instructional time singing songs, playing games, and doing social-emotional activities that are not relevant to what we are learning. In addition, I want to be able to give students the opportunity to participate in the learning process and creatively displaying their knowledge, something I do not think they can do sophisticatedly at the lower elementary level. I am against patronizing students in any way, which I think is necessary at times at the elementary level because they do not have the attention span to focus on lessons in the same way that middle school and high school students do. But to some extent, my dislike could be because I do not really know what they do in elementary (especially K-3) outside of my experiences as a student 11-16 years ago, talking to my former neighbor's children, and brief chats with customers who have young kids at my grocery store job. I have had roughly 15 hours of observation in an urban elementary school library before. The students were very rowdy and the school librarian was perhaps a little too strict with them. I did not like the experience. I enjoyed the 10 hour urban middle school and 10 hour suburban high school observation I did, plus the two weeks of observation I did at another suburban high school right before COVID-19 shut everything down. I expect my student teaching placement department will put me with an elementary school library at least part of the time to build broader teaching experiences (and also because they know I do not like it and they want to push me out of my comfort zone a little bit), so I recognize my assessment might change.",thank telling experience valuable hear find perspective teaching pedagogy content good perspective take even though often think way really gave new challenge changed perspective literacy made able work many different variety student want value able teach way allows student develop ability show insight learning make new discovery research inquiry process want go depth covering make topic come alive student want spend instructional time singing song playing game social emotional activity relevant learning addition want able give student opportunity participate learning process creatively displaying knowledge something think sophisticated lower level patronizing student way think necessary time level attention span focus lesson way student extent dislike could really know especially i outside experience student year ago talking former neighbor child brief chat customer young kid grocery store job roughly hour observation urban library student rowdy librarian perhaps little strict like experience enjoyed hour urban hour suburban observation plus two week observation another suburban right couid shut everything expect student teaching placement department put library least part time build broader teaching experience also know like want push comfort zone little bit recognize assessment might change,valuable hear perspective good new perspective able many different able insight new depth alive spend instructional social emotional able give sophisticated lower student necessary lesson i outside former young urban library librarian little strict urban suburban couid placement library least build broader little

Middleschoolteachers,My former NJ colleagues (in a few different districts) told me they have a virtual ceremony already planned. One did a middle school move up last week and one has the HS virtual grad ceremony in the works because parents did not want their kids getting together with others and getting sick and they did not feel comfortable (overwhelmingly according to the numbers) sitting in an auditorium or football field. The teachers were relieved to participate virtually.,former no colleague different district told virtual ceremony already planned one move last week one i virtual grad ceremony work parent want kid getting together others getting sick feel comfortable overwhelmingly according number sitting auditorium football field teacher relieved participate virtually,former different virtual last virtual sick comfortable auditorium
Middleschoolteachers,"To answer the question about what to do instead. First, you should have access to health records and for older students, ask them using a confidential form when you get other info, so you know about food restrictions. How about a food that can have a look-a-like alternate- cup cake made with rice flour instead of wheat. Or give everyone choices of two or three things. Or food alternates: Stickers are pretty universal- even college students and the harder to please middle schoolers like them, although the later will not admit it. Cheap silly toys- plastic spin tops, pull back cars- to give out or just use in class and you can even have competitions. Time- a get out of homework pass or 1/2 homework pass (if they test well, maybe they do not need the homework), extra free time. School supplies- fun pencil/pen, highlighter, sticky notes, fun eraser. Give a coupon for a test point for future test, first choice of recess toy, or homework late pass. Wheel of fortune type spinner with low or no cost prizes-use ideas above. I personally prefer to build in rewards- finish your work and get free choice and celebrating without food- game play, but food is a big part of various cultures, so I understand including it.",answer question instead first access health record older student ask using confidential form get info know food restriction food look like alternate cup cake made rice flour instead wheat give everyone choice two three thing food alternate sticker pretty universal even college student harder please schoolers like although later admit cheap silly toy plastic spin top pull back car give use class even competition time get homework pas homework pas test well maybe need homework extra free time supply fun pencil pen highlighter sticky note fun eraser give coupon test point future test first choice recess toy homework late pas wheel fortune type spinner low cost prize use idea personally prefer build reward finish work get free choice celebrating without food game play food big part various culture understand including,answer first confidential info alternate give universal later cheap toy top homework extra free pen sticky give first late low build free big various

So three months in we are going over a test in class, and after it is done kid says I misgraded his test enough to move it from a B- to an A. Long story short he used a different color pen on the new answers that were the correct ones I some how missed. I showed the test to my mentor teacher and he said yes that is cheating. I ask the student to come and see me after school about the test and he never comes. Then out of the blue a month later the parents show up demanding I take a lie detector test with his friend at the FBI because I some how erased the student's correct answers with incorrect ones. I was speechless but my principal told them we do not treat teachers like that and sent me out with orders to take a long weekend to deal with the stress of it all.

Middleschoolteachers,"The best way to handle that would be to as someone else said keep middle school and high school students at distance learning and use all of their facilities as elementary classrooms. That would dramatically help with the reduction of class sizes and deal with the childcare issue (maybe also have those older students with special needs also come in for that reason). Of course, in order to do that wed need a much bigger budget in order to hire a bunch more staff (which will probably only be temporary since they will be gone more or less once we go back to normal).

Middleschoolteachers,"Out of curiosity, why are you so dead-set against elementary? I ask because when I first started looking for teaching jobs, I was sure that I wanted to teach high school ELA or Social Studies, but would unenthusiastically accept 8th grade - definitely not younger. I wanted to teach content that excited me - whether it be history with nuance or texts with depth. I wanted material to spark deep, Socratic discourse. My training year, I was placed into 6th grade ELA. The following year, I was moved into 4th grade Reading. That was five years ago, and I am still doing that (though I added Writing into the fold this year). Why? Well, one thing I have learned is that, no matter the name of your subject, *your* field of study is *how kids learn it*. In the case of elementary ELA, that is litera*cy*. By high school, at least insofar as the standards are concerned, that is more litera*ture*. Coming out of college, I was certain that my interest in the former far exceeded my interest in the latter. Now, it is the reverse: litera*cy* is a massive, terrible, beautiful, dark and deep monster full of utterly fascinating mystery and challenge. I teach fourth grade, and, after several years of seeing younger students from afar, I am comfortable saying that I would prefer not to teach younger than that. Also, after a year in a middle school, I am comfortable saying that I would prefer to not teach sixth grade again, and probably not seventh, either. I do still have some curiosity about eighth grade and above, but would only pursue such a change if/when I become bored with 4th grade or simply fed up with the direction my district academics team has been going. (From what I can tell, students and content in fifth grade are pretty similar to those in 4th, but where I am, 5th is middle school, and I would not want to make such a drastic environmental change without getting to experience new content and pedagogy.) However, even if I *do* end up switching to high school, I can say one thing with certainty, with regard to my time in elementary: I will be a better teacher for it.",curiosity dead set ask first started looking teaching job sure wanted teach ela social study would enthusiastically accept the grade definitely younger wanted teach content excited whether history nuance text depth wanted material spark deep socratic discourse training year placed the grade ela following year moved the grade reading five year ago still though added writing fold year well one thing learned matter name subject field study kid learn case ela literal cy least insofar standard concerned literal ture coming college certain interest former far exceeded interest latter reverse literal cy massive terrible beautiful dark deep monster full utterly fascinating mystery challenge teach fourth grade several year seeing younger student afar comfortable saying would prefer teach younger also year comfortable saying would prefer teach sixth grade probably seventh either still curiosity eighth grade would pursue change become bored the grade simply fed direction district academic team going tell student content fifth grade pretty similar the the would want make drastic environmental change without getting experience new content pedagogy however even end switching say one thing certainty regard time better teacher,dead sure social material deep socratic added fold subject learn literal least insofar literal certain former exceeded literal massive terrible beautiful dark deep full fourth several younger comfortable younger comfortable sixth eighth fed academic tell similar drastic environmental new

Middleschoolteachers,"Another time, I was a middle school social studies teacher. We had a young lady in the 8th grade who had some anger issues. She would often lash out at students. she got into fights and she was caught stealing from a teacher's purse ones. We also found that sometimes she would show up to school under the influence. So we were in second semester and had just gotten back from the winter vacation when this young lady got into an altercation. She got into a fight with a 7th grader who had, apparently, looked at her secret crush in a way that made the 8th grader unhappy. The angry eighth grade student then started to pummel the 7th grade student with her fists and literally ripped out chunks of the girls hair from her scalp. So the student was suspended for a week even though her mother was hollering so loud that everyone in the office could hear her that it was self-defense because her daughter was protecting her man and just marking her territory. fast forward a week. The student is back and weird things start happening. The nurse is inundated with a dozen different students were complaining to feel sick. Other students are sitting in class and appear to be high. It turns out that this wonderful 8th grade girl Upon returning from suspension decided to distribute marijuana laced candy to her friends and classmates. She admitted that she was attempting to set up a market for the stuff and make some money. Her mother was called into the school as was the police. When the mother got there she went off on the principle, the assistant principal and me, since I was the one who busted her, about how mad she was at the situation. She was not mad at what her daughter had done. She was mad because we turned over what was left of the marijuana candy to the police. Marijuana was illegal in our state at the time. She went on a massive rant about how we had no right to give her candy over to the police just because her daughter gave some to other students. She also stated that it is not her daughter's fault that some of the other kids, as young as 5th graders, could not handle the stuff. The student was expelled and the mother was not happy. She called in her brother, the girl's uncle, to come and yell at us. He came in reeking of weed. Even Cheech and Chong would tell this guy to lay off the weed of it. He came in yelling about his niece being suspended and how we had to convince the police to give back the candy.

Middleschoolteachers,"Okay, here is a long-ass answer. Calculus was invented about 50 years after the invention by Descartes of the Cartesian coordinate system, and really made popular and known about 80 years after, almost exactly 300 years ago. Descartes literally invented the graph of the polynomial. It is hard for us to understand how *separate* the disciplines were. In the 1000 years prior, geometry had settled into being a proofs based system with a fairly understood sequence for teaching. This was used as training for priests, and the upper class, and represented a fundamental belief in *certainties*. When they asked, ""How many angels could dance on the head of a pin?"", this was a *real* question that they thought would allow them to use the absolute dictates of an internally coherent logical system to make statements about the physics and understanding of the universe. Descartes' *cogito* uses this kind of mapping from internal ideation to external validity to round off the stumbling fourth step of the cogito. * I think therefore I am * I am, therefore I must be in *something* * I can imagine a perfect benevolent God. * Because I can imagine perfection, therefore perfection, and therefore God, exists. * and because he is a benevolent God, he would not leave me to be a brain in a jar, and so therefore the world exists. * I think --&gt; therefore reality exists. Anyway, long story longer: The rise and development of Al-Jebra rose out of trading and Silk Road, so think Marco Polo (13th century). By the writing of Descartes, it is had about three centuries to percolate outwards, and upwards in class. However, it is still seen as very dirty, lower class. Think of how a priest might feel about the mathematics of a merchant CPA. Separate. Along comes Descartes, and says, ""well what if we try placing plane geometry - which has only two tools, the compass (fixed distance) and the straight edge. It does NOT have angles ratios, in the trigonometric sense, though certain triangle ratios have been explored in proofs. So this is the birth of **analytic geometry** and **functions**. 50 years later, *using that new tool*, Isaac Newton and Liebnitz begin to consider limit functions as instantaneous rates of change. *Out* of that - not before, trigonometry is developed to what we think of as trig in 1745. So now you have **algebra**, specifically equation solving, and a new discipline, *analytic geometry*, and now a **new** discipline, **trigonometry**. Once you had studied each of these, in depth, you could begin to understand Newton's Calculus, and by the time of the birth of trig several hundred people or more could do Calculus, with more becoming interested all the time. Now let us look at the state of education. In the world of the 17th century, much if not most education was within the framework of the seminary and the idea of the modern college was emerging. Harvard - 1636. Yale - 1701 Cambridge and Oxford and the University of Paris had lineages as old as the mid 12th century, but perhaps it is best to view those in the context of being THE school, not in a world of readily available schools. By the foundation of the United States, Calculus and Trigonometry exist in the world and some people at the University - some - study it. Literally at the same time as the birth of Trigonometry and the spread of calculus is the **industrial revolution**. They are the same thing. They are part and parcel of one another. Things that mark the industrial revolution were only possible through the birth of these new mathematics, such as standardization of bolts and screws, the ability to manufacture matching parts, etc. Eli Whitney built his factory for interchangeable gun parts in 1798. So the upper class, and some middle and lower class adults who develop some skills and get into colleges (the seminary was a way for the poor to become educated), are studying Calculus not at the post-grad level, but now at the graduate level, and now the undergraduate level. Calculus *requires* you to be deeply facile in the other three disciplines, algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. As younger and younger students are needing that, the study of these things gets pushed into teen schooling, first at boarding schools for the middle and upper class, and then of course we have the invention of the modern public school by Horace Mann in the mid 19th century, and by the late 19th century, public schools **begin** to outnumber private schools. Dewey, at the turn of the 20th century, began convincing Americans that education should be free, universal, and focused on character and civic virtue, not simply trade school or erudition. In the 20th century, mathematics at the high school level was frequently, if not almost universally, taught as Algebra, Trig and Geometry, and calculus for those who could achieve it. As soon as calculus entered the public high school system, it re-oriented the purpose of the other classes, just as the invention of calculus had conjoined algebra and geometry two hundred years early. This can be viewed as the driver for mathematical reform in the 70s and 80s (""New Math"") and our current trend towards integrated mathematics and communication in mathematics. Obviously, I have skipped a million things, but here is the **tl:dr - of course you will never USE calculus in the middle school or even high school level, but if teachers did not have to take calculus, they would have zero idea of what the pieces of the puzzle fit together to make.**",okay long as answer calculus invented year invention descartes cartesian coordinate system really made popular known year almost exactly year ago descartes literally invented graph polynomial hard u understand separate discipline year prior geometry settled proof based system fairly understood sequence teaching used training priest upper class represented fundamental belief certainty asked many angel could dance head pin real question thought would allow use absolute dictate internally coherent logical system make statement physic understanding universe descartes cogito us kind mapping internal ideation external validity round stumbling fourth step cogito think therefore therefore must something imagine perfect benevolent god imagine perfection therefore perfection therefore god exists benevolent god would leave brain jar therefore world exists think it therefore reality exists anyway long story longer rise development al zebra rose trading silk road think marco polo the century writing descartes three century percolate outwards upwards class however still seen dirty lower class think priest might feel mathematics merchant cpa separate along come descartes say well try placing plane geometry two tool compass fixed distance straight edge angle ratio trigonometric sense though certain triangle ratio explored proof birth analytic geometry function year later using new tool isaac newton liebnitz begin consider limit function instantaneous rate change trigonometry developed think trig algebra specifically equation solving new discipline analytic geometry new discipline trigonometry studied depth could begin understand newton calculus time birth trig several hundred people could calculus becoming interested time let u look state education world the century much education within framework seminary idea modern college emerging harvard yale cambridge oxford university paris lineage old mid the century perhaps best view context world readily available school foundation united state calculus trigonometry exist world people university study literally time birth trigonometry spread calculus industrial revolution thing part parcel one another thing mark industrial revolution possible birth new mathematics standardization bolt screw ability manufacture matching part etc eli whitney built factory interchangeable gun part upper class lower class adult develop skill get college seminary way poor become educated studying calculus post grad level graduate level undergraduate level calculus requires deeply facile three discipline algebra analytic geometry trigonometry younger younger student needing study thing get pushed teen schooling first boarding school upper class course invention modern public horace mann mid the century late the century public school begin outnumber private school dewey turn the century began convincing american education free universal focused character civic virtue simply trade erudition the century mathematics level frequently almost universally taught algebra trig geometry calculus could achieve soon calculus entered public system oriented purpose class invention calculus conjoined algebra geometry two hundred year early viewed driver mathematical reform new math current trend towards integrated mathematics communication mathematics obviously skipped million thing to do course never use calculus even level teacher take calculus would zero idea piece puzzle fit together make,invented cartesian popular known graph polynomial hard u separate understood priest upper fundamental many real absolute coherent logical physic understanding universe internal external fourth perfect god benevolent long merchant cpa separate come plane trigonometric certain proof analytic new instantaneous trig new analytic new understand trig several interested u much seminary modern harvard old context available birth industrial industrial possible new eli interchangeable gun upper lower skill seminary poor undergraduate facile analytic younger younger study first upper modern public public private american free taught calculus public purpose algebra mathematical new current calculus take

Middleschoolteachers,"This is a hard question to answer. 50% of new teachers leave in the first 5 years of their career. There is not just one issue. Some schools I have worked in have high turnover rates because teachers cannot handle the students at the school. Some schools are like prisons. I once was an AP at a school where I had over two dozen middle schoolers with probation officers. Assault, rape, arson, theft, and gang affiliation were not uncommon. I had the police there once a week at least. Some leave because teaching is hard. it take a lot of time, dedication, and patience to teach. A lot of people cannot handle their one kid during this pandemic. Imagine when I taught 6 classes a day and each had 40 kids. I had no room to walk around in my classroom. Stress is a big factor for some. Deadlines, state exams, evaluations, and parent conferences are just the tip of the iceberg. I served in Iraq when we invaded and I found some days being a teacher/admin more stressful. it is hard for me to say that there is one thing that can lesson the load.

No practicing needed. Do what you need to do and do not waste anyones time. Spoiler alert: this did NOT work in my middle school classroom. After moving from high school to 7th grade, my classroom management was absolute shit the first 9+ weeks. I was NOT prepared to have explicit directions for everything. Middle schoolers need lots of reinforcement, and expectations need to be taught, modeled, and revisited routinely. They want you to think they are independent, but they most certainly are not. I was ready to quit after the first semester, to be honest. I Am now entering my 4th year in middle school (2 years in 7th, 1 in 6th, and upcoming in 7th), and I love it. They Are goofy.

Middleschoolteachers,"I can think of some ways in which knowledge of high school level calculus (so-called horizon content knowledge) can help inform instruction in earlier courses. For example, I see a unit on piecewise functions in Algebra 1 as an opportunity to get students thinking (informally) about limits and continuity, and this exploration can be a great way to have them put into practice their understanding of piecewise functions. And I think there are lots of other examples of where knowledge of calculus and real analysis can deepen instruction, not just in algebra but in geometry as well. But I agree that calculus is kind of overrated. I would rather that middle school teachers be expected to know number theory and be able to prove the fundamental theorem of arithmetic than be expected to know calculus and be able to do integration by parts.

I Am not harassed about what I Am doing for no reason; I only get visits if its observation time or I specifically told someone I planned something cool for class that day and invited them to join us.

Middleschoolteachers,"Yes, the tape diagrams! Those are a big issue! I have no problem with them in and of themselves, but in the middle school sections, Eureka transitions from tape diagrams to more algebraic representations. The issue is, since our kids do not use Eureka in elementary school, they are not used to tape diagrams. So the 6th grade spends time teaching them those skills just for them to turn around and be told to stop using it by the time 7th grade comes around. We end up playing a lot of catch up teaching them skills that Eureka thinks they should already know. Also, what you said makes a lot of sense when I think about it in the context of my situation with the advanced classes. When the top ~40% of kids are pulled out of our grade level classes to go into advanced algebra or geometry courses, then that 20-30% of students you mention ends up being 50% or more of the population we are using Eureka with. So in our grade level classes, we see huge amounts of kids unable to make the connections Eureka expects of them.

Middleschoolteachers,"I am a middle school art teacher and this year has been hellish in some ways, great in others. I killed myself at the start of the year to make almost 200 art kits for kids to pick up and take home. I equipped my classroom (I am fortunate to teach in a very well-supported program) with computer and camera tech to allow me to broadcast a live feed of step-by-step creation process on Zoom. About six weeks ago our board and our feckless turd of a superintendent decided we were all going to go back in hybrid mode, with no stable cohorts, despite assuring everyone back in January that electives and PE, which have mixed cohorts, would stay in distance learning for the rest of the year. So I had to completely reconfigure my classroom to allow for kids being back in the room, and now a good $2K worth of supplies are going to go to waste because we cannot do the work both at school and at home. I have not even begun to mention the number of kids I know who have checked out completely - they are all doing other things online, and they turn in work only after I chase after them repeatedly and/or email their parents, and the work they do turn in reflects maybe 15 minutes of half-assed work on a project that should have taken several hours of dedicated work. That said, there are also a number of kids who have thrived, and done great work. But I am so over trying to squeeze anything meaningful out of the delinquent group. It is exhausting, frustrating, and a complete waste of time.",art teacher year hellish way great others killed start year make almost art kit kid pick take home equipped classroom fortunate teach well supported program computer camera tech allow broadcast live feed step step creation process zoom six week ago board feckless turd superintendent decided going go back hybrid mode stable cohort despite assuring everyone back january elective pe mixed cohort would stay distance learning rest year completely reconfigure classroom allow kid back room good i worth supply going go waste cannot work home even begun mention number kid know checked completely thing online turn work chase repeatedly email parent work turn reflects maybe minute half assed work project taken several hour dedicated work said also number kid thrived done great work trying squeeze anything meaningful delinquent group exhausting frustrating complete waste time,hellish great start art pick live hybrid stable january mixed rest online email minute several great squeeze meaningful complete

The KISS principle applies well in distance learning. My lessons every day are predictable, simple, asking for the bare minimum. I Am practically spoon feeding standards content. The expectation is set early on, and you can always refer to the fact that your lessons are not complicated and predictable. 3. Your weekly planning becomes less stressful.

Middleschoolteachers,"My context is a middle school ELA teacher. 1. I have formatted my instruction to be based on teaching skills, instead of content. For example, we spend one 'unit' on 'making text connections - to person, text and world'. During this unit, we will read, write and view texts/images. 2. Because we are teaching the skill, I have basically abandoned worksheets. I have some stuff I will use as graphic organizers, but that is the extent because... 3. Formative work is just class discussions (around the graphic organizer) and student conferences. I do not actually take the organizer in for a grade. This way, I can grade them, largely, live. 4. Summative work is based on their own self-assessment of their learning. They build unit long 'portfolios' that show their growth in the skills. These portfolios are student-selected, and they provide me with an explanation as to why it is their best work. These are the only things I grade. 5. I have around 7 units, and each takes around a month. We then spend the last 2-3 months on small group book clubs, where they have a package they progress through over the months that acts as a compilation of their skills. I will grade this as well, but are set up to provide opportunities for self-assessment. I also have four prep-time blocks in the week, and divide them as: * 2 of them are for planning * 1 is for grading on-time submissions * 1 is for grading lates (should I lose a prep due to a meeting, this is the one that goes) I arrive usually 15 minutes before contract time (largely for social reasons because I have an amazing teaching team) and stay up to 30 minutes after contract time (for largely the same social reasons).

The principal pushed some other teachers to change his grade. This kids grade was eventually overridden by the principal (at least, this is my understanding of the story) and the kid went on the trip. We fly to mother fucking Washington DC in late February. There is snow on the ground. It is bellow freezing. This kid forgot to bring shoes. He wor fuzzy slippers on the plane and had no other shoes with him. The kid had to walk a mile in the snow before we could stop somewhere to buy shoes. Also my dad moved to another school after that year. I think he was already done with the school, but he stuck around until I graduated. I was bullied mercilessly, and admin made things a lot worse for me. At one point a kid snuck up and choked me unconscious, and I was unable to talk right for a couple days. He got a one day suspension, and the principal tried to suspend me as well. I think he stuck around to make sure I was safe and had a safe place to go at lunch/recess/after school. That school sucked.

Middleschoolteachers,"Teaching is a very fulfilling job if you have good relationships with the people you deal with (students, admin, colleagues, parents - in order of importance). I love my job, even though I teach at a title 1 middle school that is one of the lowest performing in my state. There is a lot of bullshit, but that exists in any job. This sub may echo real issues and concerns within the field, but it is obviously a hub that collects a disproportionate amount of negative attention. This sub is incredibly toxic. There are still a lot of normal every day teachers on here but there is a sizeable chunk of teachers that frequent this sub that are just....toxic people. You probably have people that you knew in school that just had an overall terrible attitude, were low achievers, and spent more time sulking and complaining then just taking care of their shit. This sub is saturated with those types of people. Then you have the people on here who are just in the worst fucking possible situations and are obviously depressed, burned out, and empty husks of their former selves. They all come here to vent and get support. There is a lot....a LOT of negativity in this sub that does not give an accurate picture of our profession. Think about it this way: Most people who are very happy, satisfied, and fulfilled by their teaching job are not going to go out of their way to post on reddit about it. But those depressed people who just need to be seen/felt will flock where they can get it. My only consideration for you would be: Make sure that if you still want to be a teacher that you are comfortable moving far away if you need to. The teaching profession varies wildly depending on where you teach. If you are not comfortable moving far from home to find a good teaching gig then I hope you are lucky enough to live in a good area for teaching. As for the state of the profession, I am hoping that the pendulum will start to swing the other direction in the next decade.

When they come to me, many of them openly tell me they have never had to study in their lives because there was no rigor involved, and they never really had to do any homework. They also have realized by high school that most of their teachers never actually read their work or offer feedback so they do not view assignments as anything more than busy work that is not important.

Middleschoolteachers,I stopped enforcing cell phone policy. Parents are sending their middle schoolers to school with THE MOST ENTERTAINING DEVICE EVER CREATED IN HUMAN HISTORY in their pocket. And they expect me to regulate their childs cell phone usage during class? Fuck that. My parents did not send me to school with my gameboy. And a gameboy pails in comparison to the entertainment of a smart phone.

Middleschoolteachers,"See I Am of the opposite mindset. I used to be a real stickler about late and missing work. I had a comprehensive sliding scale for how many points off corresponding to the number of days it was late with a strict cutoff after 5 days. I do not think it increased the sense of urgency to turn things in for my middle school kids. And truth be told it was a lot to keep track of too. One day I spoke with my old AP about it and he really turned my head around on the issue. He did not believe in points off for late work since the grade you assign is not based on the timeliness of the work, its based on the assessment of the skill. It took me until we went fully remote to implement the policy I have now. I no longer take off any points for late work turned in, because the mere fact that they are turning anything in should be encouraged and celebrated, not punished. Not to mention the fact that most of the kids who turned in late work were the ones who needed the extra points the most. Especially during a pandemic, I realized that life was still happening for these kids at home, a lot of which I did not realize. They could have had family members sick or dying and there I would be harping on a late comprehension assignment. It treats our students more like people rather than cogs in a machine or numbers on a spreadsheet. I still preach deadlines to them, but I give them until a week before the end of the quarter to finish any assignment we have done. Most who wait until then have sealed their fate, but they do so knowing that they had plenty of chances to do it. I also make sure the parents know about my policy so there is no excuses for why an assignment was not turned in. Beyond that, it also is another box I can check for how I accommodated their students needs in a way beyond just teaching style. Some may say this is a detriment; I respectfully disagree. Its giving our kids a chance to be seen as humans with real lives and problems. We cannot preach mental health all the time and then turn around and send mixed messages to our students through our policies too. Procrastination culture is a thing because our society is one that values productivity, but our worth and our students worth is inherent even without all of that.",see opposite mindset used real stickler late missing work comprehensive sliding scale many point corresponding number day late strict cutoff day think increased sense urgency turn thing kid truth told lot keep track one day spoke old ap really turned head around issue believe point late work since grade assign based timeliness work based assessment skill took went fully remote implement policy longer take point late work turned mere fact turning anything encouraged celebrated punished mention fact kid turned late work one needed extra point especially pandemic realized life still happening kid home lot realize could family member sick dying would harping late comprehension assignment treat student like people rather cog machine number spreadsheet still preach deadline give week end quarter finish assignment done wait sealed fate knowing plenty chance also make sure parent know policy excuse assignment turned beyond also another box check accommodated student need way beyond teaching style may say detriment respectfully disagree giving kid chance seen human real life problem cannot preach mental health time turn around send mixed message student policy procrastination culture thing society one value productivity worth student worth inherent even without,opposite real late comprehensive scale many late strict old turned late remote late mere punished late extra pandemic sick late cog finish plenty sure disagree human real mental mixed worth inherent

Middleschoolteachers,"I think this depends what you teach, and how many students. For example, this year (and last), I have taught English and Social Studies to two groups of seventh grade students. I have about 45-50 kids (kids come and go as the year progresses). I absolutely do no work outside my contract hours on a regular basis. This year I did spend about an hour doing report cards on a Sunday, but those could have been done Friday at work - I just gave my students a few extra days to catch up if needed. But other than that, I have not brought any work home. I arrive to work about 25 mins early by choice and socialize with coworkers. I leave at contract time. But I Am sure if I taught elementary school and was self-contained, this would not be possible. It also was a lot more difficult when I was teaching 180 students (I did that a few years ago), because there is a lot more to grade. Less to plan though, since I was only teaching one subject. I plan during my prep and grade while students work. It is 100% doable as a middle school teacher. I Am in my seventh year. Its the only reason I Am sane and still in the profession.

Middleschoolteachers,"Let me guess. Middle school? When I first got into teaching, it was traumatic. I was always with the popular group in my own high school years so it shocked me how these kids would read me. Like tf. I just met you, you little shit. But I started to work on myself spiritually and really realize that as a teacher, I have the power to create the world I want to live in. I can create joy, love and peace. Now, I freely and openly compliment my students about their style, their intelligence, their resilience, etc. I have also learned to take their insults as jokes. Why yes, I do think I Am all that with my oompa-looking ass . To last, we really do need to develop thick skin. It helps to know that these insults come from a dark place and from their own deep insecurities. Its up to us to allow kindness to she would light and love.

Middleschoolteachers,"Retired teacher and sober alcoholic here. Many teachers do drink, and there seems to be assumption that all teachers (especially in higher grades) drink. But it is not true, though a lot of socializing revolves around alcohol. My experience is that some of my colleagues (especially when I taught Kindergarten) just did not like alcohol. They were not alcoholic, they just did not drink. Whereas when I taught middle school far more of the teachers drank, though mostly not to excess. But yes, there are untreated alcoholics among teachers, just like there are untreated (and sober) alcoholics in any profession, whether it is nursing, dock workers, chefs, or whatever.

Middleschoolteachers,"I agree with the constant disrespect and how our power to hold them accountable has been diminished. My last school had detention, this school does not. We can ask them to regocus write a reflection, contact parents, restate expectations,coach them, praise the positive, change seating chart and write a conduct referral. This does not work with escalating behaviors. ISI is the consequence from admin but there is no foresight or guidance beyond them staying in the room for a day or two. Some kids have 5 or more major conduct referrals, serious violence on the bus, fights, destroying school property, and harrassing/bullying others. The fact that admins answer is to question my toutines and management each time. I have been told, ""if it was me I would think why they are acting this way in my class instead of Mr. S."" ""Ask yourself, are you managing or micromanaging "" ""Ask yourself why students feel the need to record you"" ""If there is professional conduct, there should be no concern from your part"" ""We need to talk about your conduct towards this student...."" Reach out to parents or yeah, that is a minor behavior and teacher managed. Even if its repetitive and ongoing....there is just ""oh yeah"" I have only had two walkthroughs. No specific feedback just vague, oh I Am seeing good things, I can see you put in work at the beginning of the year. When teachers are exhausted and struggling it behooves admin to lean in and listen harder. Also, lesson plans, seating charts and quick 5 minute walkthroughs do not give a picture of the day to day live interactions and having to be on high alert. We deal things that are unpredictable and kids who are affected by each other and the environment. It is bullshit....because you cannot see that in a stupid lesson plan layout. The parents want to deflect from their kids behavior, its the teacher, the other kids, the school, Tiktok....what is not being said is that kids should be held accountable for their choices and what is the plan to do that. What is the kids role, their consequence, their reward....it is not me as a professional that should be questioned about my conduct. Being new to the school still, I do not have some established relationships with other teachers, some report similar behaviors but it seems an impossible task as a middle school teacher to ask them all for input.

Middleschoolteachers,"I second this! I am in complete agreement. \* Yes! 1. I do not work more than 30 - 50 minutes outside of my contract hours except I get to work 15 minutes prior because I like to and I will stay 30-45 minutes past to finish grading tests. MATH &lt; time grading. ^(\*\* if you have an idea, agree or argument see below.) 2. Students and families can contact me at work and do not answer emails or even look at them when you are not in your classroom. Start this early from the very beginning. It is a boundary that needs to be established in the beginning. Do not relax your boundary. If you do you will never get it back again. 3.

I hear teachers wasting MINUTES, up to 30, 40, 50 minutes or more talking in the hallway while I am grading, planning, prepping, etc. in my classroom almost ready to go home. And the teachers in the hallway are always staying late because they spend too much time talking in the hallway. Dumb! \*For 25 years I have been a middle school teacher, math specialist, educator, etc. and I have successfully kept my work and it is hours separate and at school on school time. Not mine. Yes, I teach math and it is also the reason I never clock more than 50 hours at school each week. And I am really, may be, making that number a little high so I do not look like a louse but I am really, good at my job. And I enjoy my job because I am able to balance work and personal time and have a healthy lifestyle. \*\*1. I only grade tests because students start HW in class and correct it themselves the next day. I help them when they are learning the material and taking notes and when the working class before they leave. I know before they leave the classroom who needs assistance and who does not, who needs differentiation and who does not. Before they have left the room I know how am I going to modify or accommodate each student and/or adjust my plans for the next day? And I do not have a problem with cheating due to my low score policy; students who score a D or F (below 60%) on any test, homework, or assignment I give they can fix the ones they missed and turn it back in for a better grade. (They know this policy is not applicable to district or state testing. There is no need to cheat in my classroom the whole point is for you to learn from the mistake. It is middle school who cares if they get a chance to do it over again. \*\*\*I do not work more than my contracted hours, do not give out my personal contact info so why would I be checking work email? Maybe someone would if they used work email for personal use which is asking for trouble. Do not do it not even just once. I declared the first and second laws so I do not have to deal with work outside of work. If you are spending too much time at work you did not set healthy boundaries between work and personal life and you probably do not have a personal life which means you probably do not have a very healthy lifestyle either. There needs to be separation between work and personal life. It is healthy. We all know the teacher that never leaves school. That puts on the play every year from Broadway or has the math club annual special Olympics for everyone in the district... That is not healthy. Nobody wants to be you.

Middleschoolteachers,"It was not an easy childhood. His mother probably had the same personality disorder he does (one rooted in anxiety). They get worse over time. We met in college at ages 19 and 20 in 1988. I had a happy childhood with mentally stable, empathetic parents who focused on allowing their children privacy and independence. He grew up in a household where privacy and boundaries were not respected. He was mercilessly bullied through middle school by students in a white supremacist gang who went on to beat a Somali immigrant to death. (Teachers and other adults did not supervise or intervene in bullying the way we are trained to do today.) At age 19 (when we met) and at age 32 (when I married) I did not have the tools or language to understand his trauma, or that it was not just sufficient to have grown up and moved out of his parents' house. He had therapy but his therapists would drop him for ""lack of progress"" which I only learned recently they were obligated to do out of professional ethics, but they never told me (when we did couples therapy) that the reason was a personality disorder. This would have been helpful to know in 2000 and 2008 (when we sought couples counseling). Our culture has shifted in the meantime, and there is better education about boundaries, the nature of abuse, trauma, and personality disorders. Not to hijack the OP's orignal post!!

I am middle school ELA, and the only one in my department, so I do not think it will fly if I try that approach. Yes life goes on, with or without me; a replaceable teacher. I also live in a state where tenure is not guaranteed at any point so it feels like a daily battle just to fight for my job. I am still developing curriculum for my new school and adjusting it to my own style and preferences. It. Just. Takes. Time. I think I am hard on myself because of the unrealistic expectations placed on teachers and how I know all of what I just wrote to be true in my situation. The contract is not going to change unless I leave schools, and right now that is just not feasible for several reasons. So I need to make due with this current position. Any other English teachers have tips for how to not work themselves into the ground?",decade teaching mean tell even early year lesson plan home grade work enter score grade book little one home time point work home student lesson next day early year tell student hey lesson going use class time plan week please screw around would chaos ela one department think fly try approach yes life go without replaceable teacher also live state tenure guaranteed point feel like daily battle fight job still developing curriculum new adjusting style preference take time think hard unrealistic expectation placed teacher know wrote true situation contract going change unless leave school right feasible several reason need make due current position english teacher tip work ground,early grade little lesson next early replaceable live daily curriculum new hard unrealistic know true leave feasible several due current tip
