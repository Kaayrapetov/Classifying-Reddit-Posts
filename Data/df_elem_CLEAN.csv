ElementaryTeachers,"-Sometimes redirection is just the name of the game, honestly. That is to say, reeling them back in to the task at hand. -kittiesandlaughs is right too, a good general rule is: if it does not seem like it should be happening, it probably should not be. And copy things you see other teachers doing that work! -In terms of the conversations about stuff like Fortnite and whatnot, redirect. Do a self check and make sure that if you are talking to the friends at your table, its a conversation about the activity! Or, That sounds like a really fun game that you can play when you get home. But right now, we need to be focusing on this! -Also it might be good to keep in mind that its just the beginning of the school year and its an after school program. So especially if you have got kids on the younger side of elementary school (kindergarten, first grade..) they are still getting accustomed to the school environment. -It being an after school program, the kids are likely pretty much spent by the time they get to you so they are almost always going to be a little off task at least. -Being cheerfully engaged usually works pretty well for me. -Be specific and direct with both critiques of a childs unwanted behavior and praise of their positive behavior. They benefit from being clear on exactly what the behaviors are that you do not want to see again, and why they should not do them. And also the exact behaviors you DO want to see more of and why they are good. -Negative example: You need to take your tennis shoes off of the table top because that is where you and your classmates eat. Your shoes have germs on the bottoms that will make you sick if they get in your food. -Positive example: I Am so impressed by how focused you are on this activity! You Are going to learn a lot with all those smart questions you are asking! -This would also be a good thing to keep in mind when the young girl does something like grabbing your arm again. Try saying something like, I do not appreciate it when you touch me without my permission. If you would like to hold my hand again next time, you need to ask and then wait until I Have said yes or no. -Yelling never solves anything and that is definitely not the sort of problem solving behavior you want to rub off on them. So when you are talking to a child about a negative behavior you have seen from them, calm but firm tones are key. -Its also usually good to try not to generalize your comments about a behavior to a point where the child then just starts to feel like they are the problem as a person. So avoid, You Are so off task, I Have asked you six times to come back to the table and work on the activity. And try, I Am noticing that your behavior is off task right now. I need you to come back to the table and continue working. -If the off task behavior continues and its really something that is bothering you, think about trying to find another way of doing the activity that may be more engaging to the students struggling to focus. -Also just in general its okay to be a little goofy with them on occasion. Kids love to laugh and they are more likely to respect someone who they like and feel a connection with! TLDR: sometimes you just got to redirect a lot, honestly. If it seems weird to you, it probably should not be happening. Be a copy cat for successful techniques from other teachers! Keep in mind they are likely still getting used to being back at school. Its after school too so their brains may be a little bit mushy already. Cheerful engagement from you can really help. Be specific and direct when talking about behaviors. No yelling, speak calmly and firmly. Never make a child feel like a negative behavior is part of who they are as a person. After a certain point, it might be good to try reconfiguring the activity a different way for the kids still struggling to focus.

ElementaryTeachers,"If it feels like it should not be happening, it probably should not be happening. Does the school have some sort of behavior plan in place? For example, I was in a school that had a system of a TEAM line in the hallway. Toes forward, Eyes forward, Arms forward, and Mouths muted. I could call out kids in the hallway when they were not following a TEAM line. So check and see if the school has some sort of common language for expected behavior. Positive behavior reinforcment ALWAYS does wonders. Call out the good behaviors! Oh Jimmy thank you for being so respectful, responsible, kind, on task, helpful, etc. That can help the other kids get on track. Watch other teachers. See what works for them and try some things out!

ElementaryTeachers,"These are the typical questions that I would ask... Was something up with this little one? Was she not feeling well? Not happy with something at school? Or at home? Or with a friend? Does she have any special needs? Little ones often can not articulate these needs. Can Mom or Dad offer any insight? Then, what makes her tick? What does she love? If it is art, maybe she wants to draw her numbers. If it is math maybe she wants to count jumping jacks. Always remember, she will want to feel liked.

ElementaryTeachers,"First year teaching. Grain of salt, but would love feedback! One focus I have in my classroom is to know how to communicate (with peers/adults/self). How I introduce myself will also be an activity for the students to know how to listen, agree/disagree, and add-on to what I say. * Pre-assess how to agree/disagree with a point, providing examples * You could get silly with a kids and give non-examples of extreme agreeing (OMG I love your idea \*hug\*) or disagreeing (well...I would not yell at them, but you get the idea). * Tell students to see where they can agree or disagree in a story about you * This is a great way for them to *practice the communication skills* you want to see in your classroom * Talk about yourself! * Name, interesting fact, favorite hobby, pets, or any other ice-breaker facts * Do not forget any shameless plugs to colleges, favorite books, local/pro sports teams * Now is a great time to positively reinforce good communication skills of agreeing, disagreeing, or visual signs of active listing (looking at speaker, sitting up straight, etc) * ""Quiz time"" (fun worksheet) * Fill out a sheet to answer questions about your story, allowing space to draw instead of or to add on to answering with words * Table below being an example |Name|One word to describe me| |:-|:-| |Favorite subject|Interesting fact| * Allow students to make their own ""Get To Know Me"" worksheet to fill out the table with their own answers about themselves.

ElementaryTeachers,"Both of my jobs were accepted the first week in July. Some contracts are signed on again until relatively late which means the candidate pool is smaller, and worked out for me! That being said, I did not just walk in to my classroom. I did not get a summer job after college because getting a job was my job. My state and surrounding states were full- I knew that going in. So I applied to every school district and county in 4 states. It was literally a 9-5 job. I had to go far to get my first position. My second was much MUCH closer to home. I had binders for my interviews (I would do a digital one now though) that showed my work. I broke it down into categories with samples of my proudest work. I also had a little section in the back of a thank you note from a parent and all the notes kids wrote. It was just a cute personal touch one interviewer enjoyed a lot. You might have done one for student teaching, if not, spend the day/weekend working on it. It was a joy to make. My coworkers who hate interviews say they do not like to brag about themselves. I like interviews because you paint a picture of who you are and what your classroom is like to someone who has not been there. You get to share your passion with someone (or a group of people depending on the interview) who love teaching as much as you.

ElementaryTeachers,"Good luck, you will do great! I Am changing districts now, and this is my second time interviewing from a distance with a new distance, here is some tips form my experience: -be SPECIFIC in your answers, try not to speak in the abstract, own your beliefs and your choices. (Also, for me, the mantra of be specific helps limit my nervous rambling lol) -research the school before you talk to them, makes you feel a little more at ease &amp; then you can start developing your own questions -think about what is important for YOU in a school. For example, its important to me that I work somewhere that values teacher input, so I ask each school I interview with what value does teacher input have in your school? Reactions to questions are just as telling as answers to questions -off of the above point, watch the TEACHERS reactions. For example, to the above question I once had two administrators talk on and on about their systems and how its important that they have teacher buy in &amp; they send surveys... meanwhile the teacher in the interview had suddenly become very quiet. Same question at another school and the teachers were talking over each other to rave about their admin and how valued they feel -if you know anyone even a little connected to the district you are moving to, REACH OUT. Check your schools alumni network, ask your advisors and professors your close with. A foot in the door is huge I know this is an intimidating process, I did a similar thing when I graduated 6 yrs ago and I Am doing it again now. Its always worked out, schools need teachers.

ElementaryTeachers,"What you have described would not concern me for his age. At his age with reading it is common to see children omit the middle and end sounds and sometimes the beginning of the word, they will reverse words, they will insert words that are not even there, or use part of a word to guess if they do not know the word, just to name a few things kids do when learning to read. This is all perfectly normal. Your school has probably given you some sight words for him to work on. Just focus on those. Have him practice writing and reading each word by itself, and have him look for those words while he is reading. If he misreads one of those words then remind him it is a sight word and to go back and check that he read it correctly. Any other words he misreads, I would not correct him, this way he will not get discouraged. As he master's sight word (he can read them quickly and correctly without having to think about it) then celebrate his success, remove those words from his practice words, and add new sight words to learn. He will love getting to check off words that he is mastered. You can do the same thing with any numbers that he writes backwards. Have him choose one or two numbers that he reverses and set a goal to write those numbers correctly. For example, he decides to focus on writing 4 correctly. After you finish math, remind him to check his number writing goal. If any 4s are backwards have him correct only that number.

ElementaryTeachers,"This is a poorly drawn example of the concept of multiplication as area. Color would have been better than all those stupid lines. See attached for two example on serve multiplication as area. First 2x3 and then 2/3 x 1/2. In each example, start at the bottom left corner of a grid of squares, and counted over one of the numbers of the multiplication problem. Then shade (in green in my drawing) all the grid squares that fall into that range from where you started that distance over. In my drawing I went over three. Then count up the other number of squares, or in this case 2, and then shade all the squares that are in this range (ie all the squares that are 2 or lower. You can see i shaded these yellow. How many squares are shaded both green and yellow? You can see that those 6 squares make up a rectangle that is 2 units by 3 units. So multiplication can be seen as area. When it comes to fractions, the same thing works, but you have to add new grid lines to subdivide accordingly. You can see for the 2/3 I subdivided the first column of squares into three equal columns which gives us 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 (which I simply labeled as 1), and I shaded the first two columns because that is 2/3rds. I then went up 1/2 and shaded across. You can see that 2 of these new smaller rectangles end up shaded both green and yellow out of a total of 6 little rectangles that together make up the first regular square (or the number 1). So, since numerator is the number of equal size pieces, and denominator is the total number of those equal size pieces that make up a whole, we get 2/6 as an answer. Hope that makes sense! If kids can learn this concept for how multiplication works, and how fractions can be represented (as both points along the number line that fall between the whole numbers AND as parts of the whole square) they will have a much deeper understanding of quantity going forward that will pay huge dividends in their understanding of all mathematics that is yet to come.

ElementaryTeachers,"First, for google classroom, since she has it from the district, I hope the district has people who can support with configuration and use. If she needs more help than they can give, or just wants another voice, check out https://sites.google.com/view/steampoweredlearning They are doing daily sessions to answer questions and help with google tools. I know the educator who runs this, and hes very good. For reading time, do you mean her reading a book to the kids? If so, I would not bother with slides and voice over. The students are accustomed to seeing her holding the book, and reading it to them. Find a well-lit (natural light is best) place in your home where she can sit and read the book outloud. Simply point your phone at her and record or use the webcam on the chromebook. I Am guessing your phone will make a better video. If you have a Bluetooth hands free setup so you can mic her, sound quality would be better. If you are going to invest money, do it on audio. Decide what your primary recording device will be...chromebook, phone, MacBook, whatever, and get a good mic that is compatible. I bought a Blue Snowball mic and it works very well on my MacBook for $70. Note: research exists about student performance and sound quality. In a classroom, even having a mic and speakers to amplify your voice can improve student performance and learning. Over computers, you want to really make sure your audio quality is solid especially with young kids. She can post the videos of her reading to google classroom so that it can only be seen by the kids and not the public. That Will remove issues around copyright. She can use google to host video chats with kids individually, small groups or even full group. I recently interviewed a first grade teacher who has been teaching online to first graders since 2016 for her tips and advice. Its on my podcast https://edmoxie.com/TL4Ed Look for the episodes with Tiffany Roberts. Ill be interviewing a 25 year veteran kindergarten teacher next weekend (4/18) to talk about science instruction with K-5 kids who are home. She can sign up and attend the live recording session if she wants to and ask questions to my guest expert. You Will see details on that on the same podcast I shared above. Tuesday (4/14) next week, Ill interview a school librarian about helping kids with reading and books,etc. with school and many public libraries closed. That Is on the schedule too. There must be other 1st grade teachers in her building/district? Teaming up would be helpful. Could be as simple as, when she wants to do 30 minutes of video meeting with her class, her peer teacher is there as a co-moderator to help push the buttons, etc as needed or even field questions from parents who are struggling with the tech. Likewise, she can do the same for her peer. Its tough to try and teach and troubleshoot at the same time...if someone has a baby brother that is crying in the background, knowing you have a partner who can mute that microphone is really helpful. She may find that for some lessons, its possible and beneficial to have both her classroom and her peers classroom together on one giant video meeting. If the goal that day was to simply read a book to the kids, then why not have one teacher read to all the kids instead of each of them repeating the process. The kids will like seeing the other kids from the other classes. That Is important for them. At school, they see each other at recess. Now, they may be limited to only seeing each other during these video calls, and then only with their main classroom group. So some of their friends will not be there since they may be in a different homeroom. They can also build it up as a treat that tomorrows story time will be special because they have a guest reader.

ElementaryTeachers,"Pros: They should have leaned a lot from their kindergarten teacher about behaving at schools.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hello! First grade teacher here! Context for you; I went into student teaching and job searching thinking Id NEVER go below third grade. I swore intermediate was the life for me. Then I got a job offer in first grade.... Pros: HUGS. all the time. Many times a day. Even after you have to reprimand them. They hold no resentment. They Are enthusiastic. They Are funny (they got into an impassioned discussion the first day it snowed about whether or not the snowfall meant it was Christmas. It had not even been Thanksgiving yet). Lots and lots and lots of lightbulb moments. They learn so much at this age. Most of the time, they want to make you happy. They Are grateful (we did a cranberry science day before thanksgiving and they thanked me multiple times. For letting them eat cranberries. That they did not even like. To them, it was still fun.) They Are easy to impress. They love when I throw a mediocre at best drawing on an anchor chart. And I think the biggest pro is that they still believe in magic. Today we started Elf on a Shelf and they are obsessed. They still believe in the holiday magic and the magic of learning and they still think that you as their teacher are one of the best people ever. Cons: This is a very chatty age for them. They learn a lot from interacting with one another and they have a hard time distinguishing between good times to talk and not so good times to talk. Multi step directions...good luck. Its more like repeat the same directions multiple times. Many times they are still working on reading, so with early finishers sometimes telling them read a book is not the most viable option (personally, I still do it). They can be forgetful. They Have asked me for missing gloves, hats, scarves, etc. more times than I can count and it is not even December. Handwriting can be interesting. Short attention spans. Constantly being asked to tie shoes. Sometimes the shoe laces are in a hopeless knot because they tried to do it themselves. Personally, for me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I never expected to love first grade as much as I do.

Will they fill in a sheet? When you have an idea of the objective the assessment kind of falls into place. If they hire you they will show you how they want lessons planned ...for now they are focused on how you teach. Your attitude, your ability to teach an objective, how you deal with behaviors and questions, your ability to teach it in 15 minutes (timing can be hard), and how well you follow the standard...aka can you teach that standard without going off the rails and such.",fond first would model explain show together class independent work minute lesson would focus whichever part feel come across best google standard see people taught well avoid focusing cute stuff like pinterest look stuff teacherspayteachers carefully written anyone good may focus standard first want kid able end lesson set objective figure get kid show understand define word fill sheet idea objective assessment kind fall place hire show want lesson planned focused teach attitude ability teach objective deal behavior question ability teach minute timing hard well follow standard aka teach standard without going rail

ElementaryTeachers,"Congrats on your recent graduation!! The top 2 things I always looked for when I was hiring and interviewing teachers were **passion** and **growth mindset**. Since our school served a really specific population of students (Autism, ADHD, &amp; other learning disabilities), we needed teachers who were truly passionate about the work. It was also a startup school, which requires a lot of flexibility, so that was another key quality we needed. We provided a lot of in-house training and coaching, so we also looked for folks who are clearly committed to lifelong learning and always looking to proactively improve their practice. Whenever I applied for a teaching job, I would research the school ahead of time and include specific details in my cover letter about what uniquely appealed to me about their school, and what I could bring to the specific role I was applying for. Since you are new, demonstrate your eagerness to learn and grow. Explain how your past job experiences have prepared you for the job you are applying for (i.e., at CFA they focus on leadership, and teaching is classroom leadership!).

ElementaryTeachers,"I am a big believer in rich experiences with texts so I would say to do it all.you could change the focus each day.

Keep in mind, teaching is a lot more than just the fun work pages. Just because you do not think your personality is the ""teacher type"" does not mean you cannot be an awesome teacher.

You also should ask the chair of the education department if s/he knows anyone you can observe or talk to. I hate public speaking (still do in front of adults or groups of other teachers) but its different in front of kids for me. However, what you are feeling is completely valid. Some people are more bubbly in front of kids, some people are still shy/ awkward/ nervous regardless. Its wise to try to figure it out now before you are locked into a major. There also are other jobs that involve working with kids but not being a traditional teacher. Maybe you should consider that route too.

I always give it back at the end of class unless they are a repeat offender. Best advice I can give you is to not say anything when you take it. Just put your hand out. They know what you want, so do not give them a chance to argue/talk back. If you are working in a low-income school, or with a student who does not have a lot of material goods, it helps to put the item where they can see it. Like direct line of sight.

The child end up waiting several hours wearing soiled clothes in the nurse's office and missing a lot of school and there is not much the nurse can do without having clean clothes for the child to change into. There were also complaints in the front office from the employees working in there as to the smell when a child does wait in there. The problem is is that even the older kindergarten children do not seem to really know how to clean up properly on their own with instruction only. Nobody is allowed to go in there and assist them and getting cleaned up and changed.

ElementaryTeachers,"Yes I use a visual checklist of about 5 things. After they learn your first most important 5 things, you can add more. Our school has a system of sending home work on Fridays using school buses, but I am assuming that is not an option for you. With the visual checklist, you have to teach and model each item. Maybe do a modeling lesson and independent practice each day for a week, so that after 5 days, they have seen and practiced each of the 5 items on the writing checklist. Then the next week bring it all together and show how to use the checklist with all 5 items. This age tends to like to check boxes regardless of it they should, so it will take practice and feedback about if they actually SHOULD check the box. Begin every writing time with a mini-lesson of using the checklist on your own story or a student's story. Have kids work in pairs and use the checklists with each other's stories. It just takes lots of repetition, time to practice, and feedback.",yes use visual checklist thing learn first important thing add system sending home work friday using bus assuming option visual checklist teach model item maybe modeling lesson independent practice day week day seen practiced item writing checklist next week bring together show use checklist item age tends like check box regardless take practice feedback actually check box begin every writing time mini lesson using checklist story student story kid work pair use checklist story take lot repetition time practice feedback

If any of them had an issue with it I would definitely listen to and think on anything they had to say, but I really would not stress about it if no one complained. I think one thing to take into consideration is the age of your students. I have worked in elementary ed and preschool and have gotten very few questions or comments on it. Whenever I was questioned I just explained to students that 'most adults have hair on their legs/armpits. Some people choose to to shave it off and some people choose not to, it just depends on the person.' Usually that is enough of an explanation for them.

You could also add in a station where they practice tracing the alphabet, numbers, and their name using their finger on a sensory bag by putting shaving cream or some gel in a plastic bag and taping the closure shut. Id also recommend taping a piece of construction paper to the back of the bag for contrast so they can see the letter formation better. You could also have them make their own bag during an art station, and they could add food coloring or glitter.

Plus it really counts in your favor as experience when you are applying and interviewing for teaching jobs because administrators know how hard it is to get and keep a good sub, and how challenging subbing is. Subbing is also a great way to get your foot in the door in a school or district that you like. You can try out a bunch of different schools, find one or more that you really like and become a regular sub there.

ElementaryTeachers,"I taught for part of the time for two semesters, and at the end of my senior year I was student teaching for the entirety, until my University had finals week. My last week was the week before finals week. The first placement I had was kindergarten, the second placement was fourth grade, and my final placement was first grade. I really enjoyed kindergarten. That woman was like a mother hen to all of those kids, and me. We had a lot of fun. I taught at a VERY rural title one school. There were 14 kids in that kindergarten class, which was perfect. I do not even think their student body topped 400. Fourth grade was a nightmare due to the teachers I was with. They had a grade level team of 5, and the kids were divided so some rotated between 3 teachers and the others rotated between 2 teachers. My mentor teacher was a part of the three-way rotation. She and her colleagues were very rude. One had the audacity to ask me, Are you sure you are cut out for this? with a giant smile on her face. It was bad. When the year started, they divided the children based on standardized test scores. There was a high, middle, and low class. This was poor planning, because all of the children with IEPs ended up in the low group and it was difficult to teach. This experience put a bad taste in my mouth for upper grades. I requested to do my final semester of student teaching in first grade because the teacher was, well, amazing. Plus a couple of the kids I had in kinder were now in her room. My request was granted, and I got along swimmingly with that teacher. It made me feel like I was meant for first grade. She taught me so much more than any course I took. She also loved her kids. All the while I taught these grades, I also student taught in special education because my university wanted everyone to have dual certification. I completed the requirements and all, but I never took the sped praxis. Idk if I still can, but its not something I want to pursue. I enjoyed my time in sped with the kids, but there is no way Id want to deal with their paperwork and the legalities of it. I started my third year teaching on Sept. 1.

ElementaryTeachers,"A lot of times what worked with my own kids was complimenting them as they did their work, giving them praises wow good job you are doing so much better its a process, but it goes a long way in making the assignments that much more enjoyable for them. If your sister just refuses to do it a lot, then I might advise talking to your mother about making her work for her privileges in the house: games, tv time, whatever she enjoys to do- because clearly she wants to do something else. And then once she starts doing it, shower that princess with some love.

By breaking the math concepts up, you are working within students working memory potential and not overloading them with concepts being more accessible for all learners.",recommendation would use penny corresponds nicely number place value focus one math concept time student learning subtract decimal number whole value teach penny math focus rounding teach student breaking math concept working within student working memory potential overloading concept accessible learner

I know that is not financially feasible for everyone, but it really helped me solidify what I wanted to do.

You Are given the opportunity to shape little minds and have a huge influence on the way students learn about themselves and their relationships with students of other cultures. I have social anxiety myself with adults, but I am absolutely outgoing with younger kids because they are just so judgment-free and we feed off of each others energy.

Are you able to set clear, concise boundaries? Create rules, discipline, schedules that students can follow and stick with? Are you able to utilize and interpret data and incorporate it into your lessons to best meet student Needs? Are you able to collaborate with a small group of teachers and share ideas?

ElementaryTeachers,"I am teaching remote 2nd graders in a district where 99% of the kids are going face to face. My students are becoming VERY knowledgeable in technology. Way more so than the in person learners. My personal children are F2F and my students are far more capable in using the district provided programs (Seesaw, Canvas, Google, Lexia, IXL, Brainpop/Brainpop Jr./classlink and then a few others that I have them work in like padlet, flipgrid, boom cards, freckles, and typing.com). Also, they are learning to use mouses, typing, recording videos, taking pictures, blogging! F2F learners at my school are not doing all of this. They are also troubleshooting their technology pretty frequently too! I have got my LMS set up so that the kids can be 100% independent as well. Unless they do not understand the content, the parents are reporting that the kids are doing it all essentially by themselves. One parent messaged me saying that their children's independence, time management, self-motivation, and confidence have risen exponentially from where they were at the beginning of this year (they have 5 children, 4 in school, 3 of them are mine [they are triplets]). He said that he feels like his kids' study habits will be so advanced, that they will not struggle like he did as a student. There are SO many negatives about remote learning. There is so much complaining, and it sucks in a lot of ways. But I choose to focus on the positives. I am seeing a ton of growth in my kids that do the work. I am giving them all of me, to make sure they have fun, make connections, and are ready for 3rd grade.

Kids would often ask him why he wore girls clothes or if he was a girl or a boy and he would answer confidently that he was a boy who liked to wear girls clothes and there is nothing wrong with that. Kids would accept his answer and move on with whatever game they were playing. I would occasionally hear some remarks from the older teachers saying they disagreed with his clothing choices or would say who really knows who they are in first grade... etc in the staff room, but never says anything offensive to him or any other parents/students and were protective if him as any other child in their class. I think as long as its not a big deal and you raise him to be confident about it it will be fine. That being said, this child I knew was definitely acting on his own interests and his folks were along for the ride.

At my university they actually encourage doubling up to broaden your skill set. So I do not see any reason why you could not do both? You could even find yourself in a small school where you teach an elementary classroom and a section of middle school social studies or something along those lines.

I used him as a classroom reward when I taught second grade. Now that were teaching f2f and virtual, I cannot bring him. There are too many laptops and chargers in my room; he would snatch one off of a table almost instantly. This past week we did not have any f2f learners per the superintendent. They come back tomorrow though, and then we continue the hybrid learning. And thanks! He really enjoys school. It was my goal last year to train him to be a Canine Good Citizen but COVID happened, and now I do not have the extra money to spend. It would make me feel better if he was trained lol.

I most say though, you need to like children which is obvious but also have a willingness to understand them and build a connection even when you do not like them. Most days I Am excited to go to work. But it is a lot of work and effort that a majority of the time goes unnoticed, which is fine with me but is not for everyone. Also regarding salary, teachers all over the United States are underpaid but I teach in NYS and I find it reasonable and livable.

ElementaryTeachers,"All of the academic apps I use are supplementary in nature. Keep in mind that the majority of the apps are 4th grade math focused since my grade level team teaches (I teach all three classes math). IXL - math practice - I like this program since it can match the adopted math program used in my district using ""skill plans"". XtraMath - math fact practice (mostly multiplication facts). I like this app since it tracks what facts students know well and which ones they need to practice. It also shows the students the answer if they get it incorrect and makes them type in the correct answer which helps them memorize the facts faster. ClassHero - Math practice but this also allows the students to choose an achievement and earn ""badges"" which are like trading cards with famous scientists on them. It is also easy to assign math topics that match the unit where currently studying. Whooo's Reading - Great way for kids to track their daily reading and also respond to their reading through providing feedback. The app automatically checks their writing and encourages them to add more detail and though as well as correct and spelling, punctuation, and grammar. The three classes are competing to see which class can have the most reading minutes and writing entries each month. [Video.link](https://Video.link) (formerly Safe YouTube). Whenever we want to show a YouTube video, we always use [Video.link](https://Video.link) since it removes ads and suggestions to other YouTube videos plus it can be edited (cropped). It also allows for closed captioning. Quizziz - fun game based way to review content. Kids enjoy it since it looks and works similarly to a video game.

ElementaryTeachers,This maybe an unpopular opinion but enjoy teaching all subjects. At my last school we had two teachers per grade level. One planned reading and social studies and the other math and science. This broke up the work load and we got to focus on our strengths. It was still collaborative and we incorporated our own style even if we did not plan that subject. At another school we taught all subjects and had little to no collaboration. It was pretty awful. It was unfortunate the year I was placed with another teacher that was also stronger in reading and social studies. We were able to work together on the math and science plans but I would have been uncomfortable being responsible for 50 kids learning math and science all year. Having only my class of 25 gave me more time to focus on those teaching strategies and I think it made me a more effective and well rounded teacher in the long run.,maybe unpopular opinion enjoy teaching subject last two teacher per grade level one planned reading social study math science broke work load got focus strength still collaborative incorporated style even plan subject another taught subject little collaboration pretty awful unfortunate year placed another teacher also stronger reading social study able work together math science plan would uncomfortable responsible kid learning math science year class gave time focus teaching strategy think made effective well rounded teacher long run

I Am currently in a elementary teacher residency, and our program is almost finished, so the most experience I have had has been working as a co teacher everyday in a Title I school. Ill be starting as a general education teacher in my own classroom at the beginning of the next school year. I decided to become a general education teacher because I wanted to work with large groups on academics, SEL, and create inclusive classroom environments that promote students critical thinking, self reflection, and their care for peers and the larger community (not any different than other general education teachers, I Am sure! ) However, I could not do my job without dedicated interventionists, counselors, SPED teachers, and other educational roles in the school (like SLPs!). From my experience, their ability to build a relationship with students is vital to helping students who may feel marginalized in the general education classroom because of the barriers you talk about. Plus, schools need SLPs and interventionists in the school community. They are a vital part of serving students. What is it that is making you interested in being in the classroom as a gen-ed lead?

ElementaryTeachers,"I feared interviews for quite some time and actually had a panic attack during my first interview into the college of education. My best advice is to gain confidence in your strengths as an educator. Know yourself and let everyone know how great you are. Compliment the person who spoke before you. Say I agree with so and so, but I would like to add whatever. Most interviews in my state are conducted as a group where you take turns speaking. I also practiced interviews with other colleagues and students while in the program. We had practice questions and answers we created that we did over and over.

ElementaryTeachers,"I am from Spain. The degree itself is not useless, there is always something you can use that you have learnt in your years at university, but it is a 10% maximum. We all feel like we do not know how to teach after finishing uni and when starting working we feel that we have wasted four years of our life because at the end we tend to teach the traditional way because we do not know what else to do. At least this is how I am feeling now. I am working as a support teacher just one hour helping students with homework and creating activities or games for them to review their subjects and I feel that I do not know what would I do to really teach them if I were their main teacher. Other huge problem that I find is dealing with bad behaviour. Despite is not my weakest ""aspect"" I struggle sometimes in making pupils listen to me or follow my indications, not to mention I am learning how to resolve problems between pupils on my own because, again, I feel uni was a waste of time.

ElementaryTeachers,"I Am 16 years in and I have this conversation with myself almost every year! I love love love to teach, but all the outside factors, politics, lack of funds, lack of respect- it can really bog you down. Some things that helped me are: 1. Find a good therapist!! 2. Set firm boundaries to keep school and home separate. When I first started teaching, Id go in super early every day, stay late, go in on the weekends, answer emails in the evening. Now, I do not check my email once I get home, even on the weekends. I only go in on the weekends once a month. And I plan one late night a week to catch up on everything. It was really uncomfortable at first, and I had serious teacher FOMO when all my friends would be in on the weekend together. But the more consistent I am with this, and the more I can really unplug from the job and be present with my family, the more recharged I feel the next day for school. (Btw, my therapist really walked me through this whole process) I also think there is no shame is saying goodbye! I Have almost done it multiple times! Some other jobs to consider are Montessori teaching, instructional coach, school librarian, online teaching, or even trying another grade level to mix it up. I also got certified as a yoga teacher and I do that on the side, but I could turn it into a full time thing, if I ever decide to take the plunge!

Like I mentioned before, it could be the first time for a lot of these kiddos and as adults its hard to wrap our brain around that. It can sometimes be difficult to teach in the typical way. It may feel like you cannot teach academics because you are correcting/teaching behavior. At that age, that is reality and can feel really frustrating for teacher you may like activities to go as planned. I Have heard a lot of teachers say they cannot work with younger children because it feels much like babysitting. I personally see it as helping children learn how to be little humans so they can have a strong foundation as they continue to grow in their education and life. But I could see how it may not feel that way for others. Lessons need to be a lot shorter. If you are the kind of teacher that really likes to dig into things, you may feel like you are running out of time before the children start lose interest. Or not be able to plan our complex or what you may consider more fun activities. Other thing to look at is the impact early childhood education has on childrens life. ECE is still growing but the research does not lie, children need intervention earlier! If your passion is in education then maybe that can be some positive motivation :)",think biggest thing would ready behavior constantly like mentioned could first time lot kiddos adult hard wrap brain around sometimes difficult teach typical way may feel like cannot teach academic correcting teaching behavior age reality feel really frustrating teacher may like activity go planned heard lot teacher say cannot work younger child feel much like babysitting personally see helping child learn little human strong foundation continue grow education life could see may feel way others lesson need lot shorter kind teacher really like dig thing may feel like running time child start lose interest able plan complex may consider fun activity thing look impact early childhood education childrens life ece still growing research lie child need intervention earlier passion education maybe positive motivation

I just think its important to remember that kindergartner could be the very first time some kids are in a formal/structured environment for long periods of time.

ElementaryTeachers,"Been there done that 1. Look on line at your district's information sheets and contacts for kindergarten enrollment. Read what they say on the site, but also give them a call. Discuss your concerns. The reality is that while districts want $$ that comes from enrollment, they very much want kids who are ready for school I would imagine that is doubly so this year with the need to focus on learning recovery due to covid disruptions. You are very far from unique, and they will be able to discuss your situation and lay out what options they have this particular year (again those may be different due to covid recovery stuff). Again -- being ""bored"" in kindergarten is not a problem. Being underwater in 7th - 9th grade is a huge problem with serious consequences. Our son who we held back is a senior this year in college (held back again due to being overseas when covid hit and having to lose a term as Germany's semesters do not mirror up with American semesters.) He is doing great. Our daughter who had the 3 friends held back is also doing fine. She did decently well through high school and played 4 years of college soccer. She is now in her 2nd year of residency for O/P. One of the other girls of the 4 also played 4 years of college soccer (must have been that absolutely fantastic kindergarten soccer coach they had) and she is in her 3rd year of Med school. Another is a newly minted lawyer once she passes the bar exam this summer, and the last is a neo-natal RN. Would they have been the same if they had moved ahead?

The current plan is to repeat PreK (FL pays for one Year of PreK and next would be out of pocket) but it would be so much cheaper to have him repeat K. Is that something you can request, though? What if the teacher says he can go ahead and it gets taken out of my hands?",thank thoughtful response but spent time sub know state i half full day request half day current plan repeat prep fly pay one year prep next would pocket would much cheaper repeat i something request though teacher say go ahead get taken hand
ElementaryTeachers,"Not a teacher. BTDT with 2 of 4 kids. My personal suggestion would be to (1) explore available pre-K options. If non stand out, then consider sending ahead with the express understanding that he is going to repeat K a second year. We did that with 2 of ours with October birthdays and a September 1 cut date. We obviously kept up on things with the teacher during the year. It made a huge difference. The oldest was a girl and she went from a well behaved but a bit behind in academics too a friendly leader. Once we made the decision we learned that 3 other girl parents from the same school also decided to hold their kids back. (We still know all the girls well and all did well academically and socially.) It worked well for our daughter so with the next - son with another October birthday, it was a no brainer. He did 1/2 day K 1st year and full day K second year. The big issue is what happens to young kids when they hit middle school. Being ahead a bit in K is one hell of a lot better than being behind physically, and in maturity, when you are in middle school. That is when the costs of starting young are paid. The facts are that you cannot tell the future. But, if you can give a better chance then you do it.",teacher but kid personal suggestion would explore available pre i option non stand consider sending ahead express understanding going repeat i second year october birthday september cut date obviously kept thing teacher year made huge difference oldest girl went well behaved bit behind academic friendly leader made decision learned girl parent also decided hold kid back still know girl well well academically socially worked well daughter next son another october birthday brainer day i it year full day i second year big issue happens young kid hit ahead bit i one hell lot better behind physically maturity cost starting young paid fact cannot tell future give better chance

ElementaryTeachers,A behavior chart is a good idea. You can also start teaching how to use I statements. You could do this with everyone and go over expectations for how to play nice together and role play certain situations. Example of an I statement: I feel .... When you/because..... You can model this for the students and they will see how to use it. You could also start praising students with rewards if you see/ hear them using the I statements in play with each other. This can help with conflict resolution. A lot of kids might not know how to play well with others and have skills in conflict resolution with peers at this young age....

Basically have yourself or a teacher observe what is happening before and after (antecedents and consequences) of his hitting behavior to figure out what is really going on.

That being said, you will not know unless you try. Do Not jump into anything. Volunteer in classrooms, spend time with kids (even rude kids and kids with bad behavior) and see if you can handle it. Maybe be a classroom assistant or para or something. See if you can handle the lesson planning. Only go into it after that. The pay is also very less for all the work you do.

ElementaryTeachers,"Do not be a teacher. The year my wife taught nearly killed them. As a new teacher, there was zero chance of being in a good school, because those were the positions everyone wanted and they only accepted experienced teachers. They were told point-blank ""You are new, so we are giving you a class with all the worst kids in the school."" It was not a joke. Kids that slept, that attended school only to sell drugs, kids that cursed or threatened, and at one point the class made up a song about how they were going to get my wife fired because they found out about me. (We are a lesbian couple.) That would have been bad enough, but the administration basically turned around and blamed my wife for everything that went wrong stating that if kids failed, it was the teacher's fault for ""not connecting,"" even though my wife was doing absolutely everything they asked, up to and including working almost seven days a week and spending our own money to try and keep the classroom together. Echoing the others here, do not think it is your job to try and teach just because there is a need. The TRUTH is that there are a lot of incredible teachers out there; it is the SYSTEM that needs to change. You might want to see if there is a non-teaching position like lunch staff, office, after-school, etc. My aunt does this primarily so she can get insurance, and it is much less soul-sucking. I cannot speak to Dentistry, but other possibilities are maybe a counselor/therapist or administration for a health care setting.

ElementaryTeachers,"I am a sub teacher for the past 6 years since I retired from government. Get with a teacher/teacher aide staffing agency first. That way you can pick and choose what schools you want to work in and what days you want to work. Subs are a godsend for staff. When it gets on your nerves, and it will, you can go online and drop the assignment. This way you can flex your time around your kids. You will need a background check and get certified thru your state. I sub at my granddaughter 's school sometime since her mother and my son are not together in a relationship. I can pop by to say hi or see her on the playground. I subbed in the early 80's before I went to government. Things are VERY different and the children are VERY different (behavior) so be very careful. Parents are VERY different also (much younger). You may want to start out as an aide in the lower grades if you can deal with the constant chatter..lol. I stay away from the middle and high school students....too many hormones and anger issues unless they are seniors looking forward to graduation and college. Middle school is rough. Private schools pay less (i.e. catholic schools) but the children are better disciplined and better behaved at Catholic schools.

Do kids need good teachers - a huge YES!! But i am going to the problem with the US is not that there is a shortage of good teachers, it is that there is a shortage of support or caring about good teachers from all sides (parents, admin, students). Just check out r/teachers for a look at what is going on the US. Insanely low pay, no air conditioning, no toilet paper, buy your own supplies, students that are apathetic with parents that do not care and YOU get blamed for all of it. Teachers are constantly, constantly scapegoated all. the. time. A lot of time about stuff they do not even have control over. We are told to ""do it for the kids"" and neglect our own health and families in order to do so. If you do not martry yourself, you are painted as a ""bad"" teacher by admin often. If you feel teaching is your calling, I am not going to tell you not to do it. But you HAVE to go into it with your guard and defenses way way up or they will take advantage of you and your time. Your first 5 years will be devastatingly hard, and that is ""normal"" for the US. You will still need to jump through licensing and development hoops, a lot of which will take up your summer time and weekends.

ElementaryTeachers,My students needed help with communication so I did an activity where they had to sort themselves into groups all while communicating effectively. I had them try the first time with no help as they sort of themselves from birthdays starting January 1 all the way to December 31.

Once this happens pause take everyone over to the carpet or meeting area and discuss what worked well and what did not work well. Give a few pointers like electing teams to work with months or a process of discussion like hand raising. Then let them try again. After that is all done and you have established a few communication strategies that you want students to use do the activity again but for this one you cannot talk. I found stickers different different colors and place them on every students forehead. Students must then use nonverbal communication skills through body language in ways that are effective.

ElementaryTeachers,"Aw, thanks! Back at ya. And I am sure you do fine with the seating charts. Still, it is like preparing for a major diplomatic meeting sometimes, is not it? LOL So, my classroom has 13 students and 4 tables. Obviously, that does not divide perfectly, so I have 3 tables of 3 and one of 4 (I actually started with 16 before they made another class and moved 3 kids out, because admin, of course, wants to make sure they can keep reminding parents that our class sizes are smaller than average). Part of that at least works out well, since everyone wants to sit at the green table (they are all painted different colors), so I can put 4 at the green table. I am trying to rotate who is at which table each month so that everyone has a chance to work with everyone else but at the same time not put my chattiest students together, if that makes sense. I have two boys who are best buds, and while I love that they are, I am worried that they would distract each other constantly at the same table (I will probably let them sit together at some point with the stipulation that they will get moved if talking becomes an issue). I also let the students spend class points to sit at the green table, with the understanding that we need to let everyone have a chance at sitting there (I have no idea why it is popular, but, hey, I can work with that). When we do morning meetings or circle time or anything like that, I let them sit wherever, of course. If I had desks, I would probably do groups as well, assuming they were open front desks. The nice thing is that you can change the seating around most anytime (""Oh, it was just getting a little boring!"" or some such).

ElementaryTeachers,"I am not saying it should be quick-fire, or that there should not be restorative practices. If it helps, I would like to say I actually agree with you - there has been a lot of trauma, some people are too quick to be punitive, and being punitive typically only ""works"" with kids who are not usually in trouble anyway. I do feel however that while that individual kid has been through trauma, so has the rest of the class, and so has the teacher. When the same kid has just pulled the rest of the class off topic for the 8th time in 3 days... Well maybe everyone needs a break. Honestly, sometimes the kids themselves need a break. People are human and when you are on edge, in a negative spiral etc., you sometimes need a little distance to reset. A former administrator of mine used to call parents and say ""this is what happened. I am not suspending little Johnny, but he needs some space and needs to go home for the rest of the day before he actually does get himself in trouble."" When he comes back, that is when the restorative piece comes back. It is not punitive, but it does allow the situation to die down a little before punitive measures are necessary.",saying quick fire restorative practice help would like say actually agree lot trauma people quick punitive punitive typically work kid usually trouble anyway feel however individual kid trauma rest class teacher kid pulled rest class topic the time day well maybe everyone need break honestly sometimes kid need break people human edge negative spiral etc sometimes need little distance reset former administrator mine used call parent say happened suspending little johnny need space need go home rest day actually get trouble come back restorative piece come back punitive allow situation die little punitive measure necessary

ElementaryTeachers,"I would recommend looking for teaching assistant positions and checking private schools. I knew I wanted to teach when I graduated undergrad but did not have an education degree either. I started with an assistant teaching job at a private school and got more experience that way. It will not be your own classroom, but it is a start and a great learning experience. It also might depend on where you live. Some states have teacher shortages and you might be able to get a provisional license (especially if you have skills that are in high demand, like being fluent in another language). If you decide you want to get your license, you might be able to find certification programs that are less demanding/costly than an actual degree in education. When I was deciding to go back to school for my teaching license, I made an advising appointment at a university near me. I did not end up going there and chose a different school, but I was still able to talk with the advisor about how long it would take to be certified, cost, etc. It helped me compare options. You could also consider Teach for America. I know it is sort of controversial, but it is a way to get your license and more experience. I did not do TFA so I cannot say much more about it. There are also AmeriCorps programs that are education-related, and you get an education award upon completion of your program, so that can help with expenses of going back to school.

ElementaryTeachers,"What grade will you be teaching? My first year I had the bare minimum but it was totally ok! You use what you have and will manage as you go. My beginning of year list looks like this: I make labels for many of the things; it is super helpful for you and the kids.I teach first so the more organized things are the better.I am going on year 7 and I have tried many things!. First graders definitely need more than the older grades. If the kids know where everything is and can be independent that is ideal and will help greatly with management. Most things I label with their name, but other things I label with their number. I give them each their own little pencil basket at their desk. I include scissors(labeled with their number), glue stick(labeled with their number, 2 pencils, an eraser, and a dry erase marker. I also label their HW FOLDER with their name and one side is take home, one is bring back. You can make these or look online because they are a ton of free materials! I label math journals, writing journals, etc. I also give them each their own book baggie or reading bin and label it. I also make two sets of popsicle sticks with their names. One set is for randomly calling on students or creating random partners, etc. The other set I use for consequences. I set up three little envelopes and put them on a bulletin board. One says warning, one says 5 min out of recess and the third is call home. The can independently move their popsicle stick to one of the folders when told to do so. I also like using the popsicle sticks because the other students cannot see who is in warning, etc. I also use popsicle sticks (or ones that look like people) for class jobs. I use the small envelopes for each job. Within the jobs, I include line leader. The line leader is always posted above our door. Each job lasts a week. I would not worry too much about the bulletin boards because it is okay if they are blank when you begin the year. I usually have one bulletin board with a sign that says ""welcome first graders"" and then take first day photos of them and put them up on the board. As you begin teaching and they are creating work, you can work on your bulletin boards. Is there any chance your district would purchase any books for you or a carpet? We can only have ""fire retardant"" carpets so before you buy anything double check with the school! In terms of organization, I have a place for everything and trust me it makes all the difference! I have drawers LABELED (words and picture) for paper clips, post its, lost and found, extra glue sticks, extra highlighters, pencils. The kids love flexible seating but I found that it has to be introduced super slowly because they can get a little crazy otherwise! My kids really like the scoop chairs and we use lap desks for writing which they love. BUT, like I said.. it takes a while to build up to this. so start with the things that you would need for the first week.

ElementaryTeachers,"Ill be a first year teacher in the fall, so I still struggle with making new ideas for meetings. I wish that my ideas were more exciting but I have some basic ideas right now! For greetings: We had a very bad flu bug going around this year (pre-corona) and it got to the point where we did more distant greetings. Its not quite the same, but we had the kids do the same greetings with near-touches. For example, they would high-five or fist bump with a few inches between the kids. I imagine that these simple greetings could work with social distance as long as the kids went around the circle in order. We also did a lot of knock-knock greetings and funny voice greetings. I feel like dice greetings could be replicated with technology if the teacher leads everything (like maybe the kids say when to press the button on your phone if there is a dice app or something). For activities: We would also bend the share/activity dynamic to fit the needs of the day in my class. For example, we would do a read aloud, education YouTube video, or song for a share or activity. We would bend it by saying well listen to x as the activity or I (the teacher) wanted to share x with you today. I also feel like some GoNoodles could be fun activities for social distancing if there was enough space in the classroom. My kids also LOVED Mad Libs when we learned about parts of speech, but I feel like that could work anytime.",ill first year teacher fall still struggle making new idea meeting wish idea exciting basic idea right greeting bad flu bug going around year pre corona got point distant greeting quite kid greeting near touch example would five fist bump inch kid imagine simple greeting could work social distance long kid went around circle order also lot knock knock greeting funny voice greeting feel like dice greeting could replicated technology teacher lead everything like maybe kid say press button phone dice app something activity would also bend share activity dynamic fit need day class example would read aloud education youtube video song share activity would bend saying well listen i activity teacher wanted share i today also feel like noodles could fun activity social distancing enough space classroom kid also loved mad libs learned part speech feel like could work anytime

ElementaryTeachers,"Hey! I totally understand what you are saying because I was an English assistant for 5 years in Spain (I just moved back to USA a few months ago). I found a lot of teachers tended to use very traditional/old fashioned classroom management techniques, although it depended on the teacher. Overall, the Spanish education system is quite traditional though. What age will you be teaching? I found secondary grades 9 eso and 10 eso to be the most difficult, but the other grades were good (I taught from 1st primaria to 2nd bachillerato). I would recommend seeing if you can buy a book on classroom management (in USA classroom management is emphasized a lot). I think it will help. Also maybe you could find a book about different teaching techniques (instead of just completely lecture/book oriented) and different projects and things that you can use in the classroom. Also you could try just googling that information.

ElementaryTeachers,"I just saw this, but I hope it went well!!! I Am also an introvert and HATE interviewing. I like to prepare answers for questions I anticipate ahead of time and I Have even put my answers next to me during interviews. I do not read from my notes, but Ill glance down and make sure I said everything I wanted to. Nobody has ever said anything about it before, but if they had I was just planning on saying that I put a lot of thought into my answers and wanted to make sure that I fully conveyed my ideas. Also, do not be afraid to pause and think about your answer. I used to feel like I had to start talking immediately after a question and then I would catch myself saying stupid things that I would not have if I took a moment to process. Once I learned to slow down, I was better at more eloquently stating my answer. I also like to keep a bottle of water with me at interviews so I can take a sip and give myself a moment to collect my thoughts. Zoom can seem awkward and intimidating at first, but focus on the advantages- you can be in a comfortable setting during your interview and you can hide the feed from everybody else on the panel except whoever is asking the question at the time.

I say bottle because frankly, I Am a lil clumsy when I Am nervous and a cup sounds dangerous. Also, remember you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you!

ElementaryTeachers,"Teaching is not for everyone. Personally I love it, but I work with teachers who wish they would chosen a different path. I teach grades 3 and 4 and have been an elementary teacher for thirteen years. I plan on retiring a teacher in fifteen years. I agree with the comment about working for adequate pay. Would I be a teacher for $30 000/yr - no. That Is a standard of living choice. If you are constantly worried about paying the bills you cannot really be happy in anything you are doing. I Am lucky to work in a region that pays teachers very well. So my advice is look into teacher pay in your area. Here are some traits to consider: 1. Are you comfortable talking in front of people? And can you be entertaining doing it? That comes first because you need to project confidence for classroom management. Your life will be hell if you do not have classroom management skills. 2. Are you patient? Do you get annoyed when people keep asking you the same question? 3. You Are going to need to be an educator but also a social worker and caregiver. 4. Are you creative? You can find A LOT of lesson ideas online but you need to have some skill at making stuff up yourself. 5. Are you organized but equally ok throwing your plans out the window? You need to be flexible and read your audience. 6. Are you compassionate? What I have learned is the #1 thing parents care about is that they are child is happy at school. Remember, when you talk to parents you are talking to them about the most important thing (sorry no better word) in the life. Always start with the positive. 7. Do you like kids? I put this last because I do not really think its about liking kids. I think being a good teacher has more to do with being compassionate, caring and empathetic. If that is the type of person you are, then that is how you will treat your students. When you start teaching, you may work a year in kindergarten then a year in grade 8. Its more about your respectful treatment of others. Hope that helps.",teaching everyone personally love work teacher wish would chosen different path teach grade teacher thirteen year plan retiring teacher fifteen year agree comment working adequate pay would teacher yr standard living choice constantly worried paying bill cannot really happy anything lucky work region pay teacher well advice look teacher pay area trait consider comfortable talking front people entertaining come first need project confidence classroom management life hell classroom management skill patient get annoyed people keep asking question going need educator also social worker caregiver creative find lot lesson idea online need skill making stuff organized equally ok throwing plan window need flexible read audience compassionate learned thing parent care child happy remember talk parent talking important thing sorry better word life always start positive like kid put last really think liking kid think good teacher compassionate caring empathetic type person treat student start teaching may work year kindergarten year grade respectful treatment others hope help

ElementaryTeachers,"I do not think that is entirely true. I have students that I had to work backwards with because of this, too. To me, as a first year teacher, the most effective way to handle management is to ONLY give attention to good behavior. Someone shouts out the answer? Ignore it and praise the quiet hand you call on. A student will not stop talking? Compliment each student around them that is not.

ElementaryTeachers,"We usually do not teach it until third or fourth quarter, so good luck to you. I introduced it, and then I introduced PIEd (persuade, inform, entertain, describe). Maybe you could do an activity with slices of pie. Anyway, You could also use this video as an activity: https://youtu.be/Tg8nFoniSjs This would help them to know exactly which slice of pie they are dealing with. Finally, read something like Robins!

ElementaryTeachers,"My son did something similar at four with another boy in preschool, joking around in the bathroom. His teacher told me, which I answered oh, boys are so grossss where we all kind of chuckled. But I still had an important talk with my son about privacy and your private area. These girls are 8 and know better, it should not seem like the end of the world but it should be addressed. It is important to know if one is touching anothers privates in the bathroom when one is going potty. That seems like something that could send red flags and as a parent I would really want to know the truth about that type of issue. I would not blame her for not being completely casual about it depending on how it all progressed and how she found them and all.",son something similar four another boy preschool joking around bathroom teacher told answered oh boy gross kind chuckled still important talk son privacy private area girl know better seem like end world addressed important know one touching anothers private bathroom one going potty seems like something could send red flag parent would really want know truth type issue would blame completely casual depending progressed found
ElementaryTeachers,"As a kindergarten teacher I have to say I absolutely hate this mentality. If a student is struggling to keep up with work, why would you make them work for 7 hours straight? I know I lose focus without breaks, I find it hard to imagine a kid who does not react the same way to a day with no breaks. Ditto withholding recess for behavior- if you are struggling to do the right thing before recess, what is going to happen to the rest of your day if you are stuck inside while everybody else plays? If students are making choices that are unsafe (or occasionally choices that are unkind) they have to sit out for a break but other than that I do not touch their recess time. Where I currently teach we are legally required to provide students with 30 minutes of recess. It used to be a parent could give permission to take recess but this year we were told that recess is a right regardless of parental permission.

This student also had a schedule and a smiley next to work she would complete on the list of activities for the day. These were methods used to make her complete work and she had command over the class behaviorally with positive reinforcements and other means.

ElementaryTeachers,"My advice is find a different profession. The pros are interacting with students and leading them down their education journey. The cons... endless paperwork, not being able to save everyone of everything, budget cuts, district plans and initiatives that do not match own beliefs. Do Not try and get some one to tell you, Oh you do not do it for the money. The fuck, yes I do, I have to eat and provide for my family at the end of the day it is an important and critical task for the survival and continuation of us, but if I could go back after seven years and change my major go something else I would. The education system is broken and no one is taking a stand to fix it including myself and the glory and pride you feel those first couple of years and times dissipated to dust when you have to deal with parents who do not care, parents who do not stick around, parents who baby their kids, parents who are overly arrogant about their student, parents who are blaming you all the time as the reason why their student cannot function. Plus politics that make no damn sense. Do Not walk, run to the nearest exit, did I mention also the meaningless raise of 200 dollars a year every two years, then you do not have tenure, everything is under a microscope, and if you want to make more money than that you have to go into more debt pursuing another degree just to make money to pay back your fucking debt.",advice find different profession pro interacting student leading education journey con endless paperwork able save everyone everything budget cut district plan initiative match belief try get one tell oh money fuck yes eat provide family end day important critical task survival continuation u could go back seven year change major go something else would education system broken one taking stand fix including glory pride feel first couple year time dissipated dust deal parent care parent stick around parent baby kid parent overly arrogant student parent blaming time reason student cannot function plus politics make damn sense walk run nearest exit mention also meaningless raise dollar year every two year tenure everything microscope want make money go debt pursuing another degree make money pay back fucking debt

ElementaryTeachers,"I was in college about ten years ago so I Am sure a lot has changed since then and I cannot remember much about my elementary math course. The one thing that does stand out in my mind is learning a numeric system that is base five. Our numeric system is base ten, meaning that each place value is ten times more than the last (tens=onesx10, hundreds=tensx10, thousands=hundredsx10 and so on). In college we had to do problems that were in base 5. Essentially the only digits to exist in this system are 0,1,2,3,4. So each place value is now five times greater than the last. You would count 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 100... Some examples of problems would be 4+2=11 14+14=33 31+42=123 100-2=43 42-23=14 The logic in learning this type of numeric system is so you can struggle and understand how children feel when they are first learning our number system. It is so ingrained in us by the time we are in college it can be easy to take this knowledge for granted. I hope this helped and good luck in your studies! I absolutely adore teaching.

ElementaryTeachers,"3rd grade teacher here! I Have been teaching for 16 years, and my first year or two, this was a really normal feeling for me. The more you teach, the more confidence you will gain. Its ok to feel overwhelmed and unsure- it does not mean you have done anything wrong! So a couple pieces of advice to help you in the moment of feeling overwhelmed- 1. Its ok to not know the answer to a question a student asks- I Am always honest if I do not know and use that as a teaching moment. Wow, what a great question! I do not know the answer to that, does anyone else? or I Am going to look into that for you! 2. Its ok to make a mistake! Again, use it to teach students that EVERYONE makes mistakes, even grownups, so they know its ok when THEY make a mistake. 3. If you are by yourself and need a moment to collect your thoughts or just breathe, ask a question and have students turn and talk about it, or have them partner up and read through a passage of something. Once you have gathered yourself, bring the class back together for a discussion. Remember, you do not have to be perfect! Teachers are people, too. Looking back, I think a lot of my overwhelm in the beginning was a fear of not being enough. But as long as you are showing up prepared and present with your students, and you are willing to learn from your mistakes, you are doing just fine!! And it gets easier- I promise!",red grade teacher teaching year first year two really normal feeling teach confidence gain ok feel overwhelmed unsure mean done anything wrong couple piece advice help moment feeling overwhelmed ok know answer question student asks always honest know use teaching moment wow great question know answer anyone else going look ok make mistake use teach student everyone make mistake even grownup know ok make mistake need moment collect thought breathe ask question student turn talk partner read passage something gathered bring class back together discussion remember perfect teacher people looking back think lot overwhelm beginning fear enough long showing prepared present student willing learn mistake fine get easier promise

So here is the thing, I learned math again using curriculum books for 3rd and 4th grade. And, it finally made sense.

I was convinced it was going to absolutely break my educational career. The good news is that your education college should have classes you will go through that basically reteach you the math taught in elementary schools. Once you master them, you can teach them a lot easier. My college had us go through two math classes that did this. We re-learned the concepts using simpler terms and did a couple practice problems. We had to solve the problems and explain every single step in written format, where a teacher would point out where our wording is confusing or identify where we went wrong. Our tests even had sections where we would identify where a imaginary student went wrong on a problem. These classes were extensive when it came to understanding the concept of mathematics, which made it way easier to explain.

ElementaryTeachers,"TL:Dr: they had a great day. I still have qualms, but I am much more relaxed than I was last night. Thanks for your reassurances and for sharing your experiences and wisdom. Today's experience with some policy details: Drop off was a cluster this morning. Car rider line was 1.5mi long and growing when i got there. I do not envy those in decision making positions. So much pressure. It was slow, but effective. There were student volunteers walking kindergarteners to their classes. Someone the boy knows (a 5th grader) escorted him to his first day at big school. He was fine. The girl knew where she was going. 2nd grade! Staff were positioned to direct traffic just in case. The boy's class had lunch in their room. The girl dined picnic style. They sat siblings together on the bus. The girl reports that there were fewer passengers than last year. I leave work at 4:30 so they get off at an afterschool (daycare). Half of kindergarten attended today to get acclimated. The other half will go tomorrow, and they will have full classes Friday. Yesterday the Governor mandated that teachers and students are to wear masks at all times. Prior to that announcement they were able to take them off in the class room as long as they were spaced out, and don them any time they were unable to distance such as in common areas and whilst working in groups. The girl's classroom has clear partitions on each desk; Tiny, transparent cubicles in which they are able to free the face. Recess and PE were also bare faced. Classrooms will be fogged with some sort of disinfectant every evening. I am an environmental scientists. Our lab will begin COVID testing on surfaces in the next few weeks. Our testing will be limited to tribal organizations and schools on the reservation where I work, but I may do some ""training"" at my kids' school. We all survived day 1.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I Am a teacher and am also head of English at a private school in England. We went back for three weeks before the summer break, and experienced socially-distanced school life in full throes of COVID fear. What is SO important to understand is that children are exceptionally malleable and care free. They do not have the fears we do, they do not go about their days whilst holding on to their anxieties about a global pandemic like us adults do. Of course, some children experience mental health conditions which would alter this, but for neuronormative children, their only anxieties will come from their parents. No, their experience will not be the same as other childrens in previous years, but that does not mean it will be any less special, or fun, or worthwhile. As cold as it may seem, not walking your child to their classroom on the first day will not change their experience of school, especially if you do not show any displeasure towards it. As a teacher, the hardest thing about teaching in this pandemic is knowing how to approach anxious and tentative parents. Please trust that your childrens schools will care for, love and act in the best interest of your child. Any experience in a school setting is better than none right now, and if your children are allowed to just breathe and enjoy their first day, you will see that it will not be as bad as you think!",hi teacher also head english private england went back three week summer break experienced socially distanced life full three couid fear important understand child exceptionally malleable care free fear go day whilst holding anxiety global pandemic like u adult course child experience mental health condition would alter neuronormative child anxiety come parent experience childrens previous year mean le special fun worthwhile cold may seem walking child classroom first day change experience especially show displeasure towards teacher hardest thing teaching pandemic knowing approach anxious tentative parent please trust childrens school care love act best interest child experience setting better none right child allowed breathe enjoy first day see bad think
ElementaryTeachers,"I am sorry you are in this position; it absolutely sucks. Your son's test came back negative - what a relief! However, he probably does have a different bug (like a cold) and I would wait a few more days before bringing him to school because you do not want other parents to have that same level of panic when their child has a fever. Your kids probably will not recognize their teachers. I went in with my mask to clean out my classroom in March and the essential workers' children did not recognize me and I have been one of their teachers for three years. That is okay. They will learn to recognize their teacher with a mask on as time continues. It will be weird and silly when they see their teacher without a mask on for the first time. Your child will not be kidnapped at school. You, and other adults, are not allowed in the building to even walk your kids to their classroom. Reassurance and comfort will be tricky, but teachers, school social workers and psychologists have been trying to figure this out for a while now and they will be able to manage it. They will not comply with the mandate. I think that is unreasonable to expect from a kindergartener as you well know. But, teachers and parents will reinforce proper mask etiquette and it will get better in time. Teachers work incredibly hard so that voices are heard. Turn and talk routines and other conversation pieces will probably be cut out to limit transmission, wetting of masks, and frustration in having to wear them. If your child needs something, a teacher will listen to their needs. They will understand them. Speech therapists are so good at what they do. It will be hard to see how to form your mouth to make the proper sound, but they will make it work. In my state, we have been told teachers can wear face shields (which do not really do much to limit spreading the virus) to allow students to see faces. It seems like this would be a scenario where maybe that is capitalized on. Your son will only feel negative about this experience if you make it feel like it is a negative - if you compare it to what it should be like. I would try to just be as supportive as possible and maintain positivity in ""You get to go to school! I am so proud of you! I cannot wait to hear all about what you learned today!"" You got this! Teachers are prepared to figure this all out and to support your children. I hope they have a great first day tomorrow and I hope you can update us about how it went!",sorry position absolutely suck son test came back negative relief however probably different bug like cold would wait day bringing want parent level panic child fever kid probably recognize teacher went mask clean classroom march essential worker child recognize one teacher three year okay learn recognize teacher mask time continues weird silly see teacher without mask first time child kidnapped adult allowed building even walk kid classroom reassurance comfort tricky teacher social worker psychologist trying figure able manage comply mandate think unreasonable expect kindergartener well know teacher parent reinforce proper mask etiquette get better time teacher work incredibly hard voice heard turn talk routine conversation piece probably cut limit transmission wetting mask frustration wear child need something teacher listen need understand speech therapist good hard see form mouth make proper sound make work state told teacher wear face shield really much limit spreading virus allow student see face seems like would scenario maybe capitalized son feel negative experience make feel like negative compare like would try supportive possible maintain positivity get go proud cannot wait hear learned today got teacher prepared figure support child hope great first day tomorrow hope update u went

ElementaryTeachers,"I used Google Classroom. I assigned many things through it using Slides as I am able to embed videos and make interactive worksheets. When we did it though we assigned essentially day's worth of work over 5 day. I posted a suggested schedule to families through our class blog and shared the same schedule within Classroom. I offered regular video chats at the same times each week so families can easily schedule around them. (Mon - optional: check in and class chat, Tues - number talks, Wed-MysteryDoug, Thurs- Lit Circle book talks, Fri- Fun Friday). This might not work if you are expected to be teaching like you were if you were at school. Depending your grade level search FB for groups based on your area and grade level.

ElementaryTeachers,"The only one of the 3 you listed I am familiar with is RAZ-kids. It is more for primary and the interface is really for that audience. If kids have a compatible device they have access to the leveled books where you can set the level and they can read within the range. It has quizzes and you can assign benchmark books where they record them selves reading (if they have a microphone) and you can doing a running record. I do not find the books to be high quality (I prefer F&amp;P, Oxford or PM books for leveled reading material.) For intermediates (grade 4/5) we ran a lit circle online and assigned books through Epic (free) and Tumblebooks (school subscription) and focused on writing summaries and analyzing quotes and hosted weekly book talks in their group. Another supplement we used was ReadTheory which provides passages based on how the answer comprehension questions. But I would use it as such a supplement and not the main program. IXL is another program that would be good for remote, not guided reading but covers a lot language arts and math wise.",one listed familiar raz kid primary interface really audience kid compatible device access leveled book set level read within range quiz assign benchmark book record self reading microphone running record find book quality prefer i amp i oxford am book leveled reading material intermediate grade ran lit circle online assigned book epic free tumblebooks subscription focused writing summary analyzing quote hosted weekly book talk group another supplement used readtheory provides passage based answer comprehension question would use supplement main program ill another program would good remote guided reading cover lot language art math wise

ElementaryTeachers,"Not sure if this is what you need, but this was my idea: During school I reward students for extra reading in class. I give them little reading log bookmarks that act as punch cards. If they can tell me the title and topic of the book and provide their opinion of it, they get a stamp. If they fill their bookmark with 5 stamps, they get to pick a prize from the treasure chest. For distance learning, were using Canvas. I Am copying this system by creating an assignment. Students will upload a video of themself saying the title, topic, and their opinion of the book. Students are able to resubmit for each book they read and when they submit 5, Ill give them a digital reward, like choosing a gonoodle or game during our designated social zoom. I think you could do something similar on Google?",sure need idea reward student extra reading class give little reading log bookmark act punch card tell title topic book provide opinion get stamp fill bookmark stamp get pick prize treasure chest distance learning using canvas copying system creating assignment student upload video themself saying title topic opinion book student able resubmit book read submit ill give digital reward like choosing noodle game designated social zoom think could something similar google
ElementaryTeachers,"I usually like to have 2 projects planned at a time for each class. For example, if I am teaching a 1st grade drawing lesson, I will start planning the next lesson (painting, collage, etc) as soon as I begin teaching. It is too much work to plan things further in advance unless you start while you have time over the summer. As a first year teacher, you will have A LOT of work this year. It will feel overwhelming, but that is normal. It gets easier each year as you add more lesson plans and resources to your tool kit. With this year starting out a bit different, I suggest making lessons that can be easily adapted to go back into the classroom setting. Last Spring, we were posting asynchronous lessons each week and teaching 1 class/day synchronously. Specialists were require to help classroom teachers co-teach, and that allowed us to work together to help figure out the applications and monitor the chat. My county was using Blackboard Collaborate Ultra for synchronous teaching lessons, and we were asked to use Blackboard at my school. We finally got approval for Google Classroom (which I was using with my students before distance learning), so I am very happy to go back to that switch. If you purchase the Future Self drawing lesson, you will see step by step instructions and suggestions for how you can use Padlet ($10/month --- my school pays for accounts but you get 3 free Padlets at a time if you want to try it first), Google Classroom, and the presentation with the students. I have found these virtual rooms to be the best way to organize everything and help the students. My main suggestions for planning... * Think about your population of students, the curriculum, and their interests and plan from there. If I have a bunch of 2nd graders that love animals and are learning about habitats in their homeroom, how can I create a fun art project that incorporates my art standards and is engaging for the students? I could show students lots of pictures of different types of habitats and animals as inspiration and have them ""discover"" a new animal. What type of features would the creature have to survive in the environment? I would have them create the creature, give it a name, and then draw/collage/paint/sculpt the habitat, thinking about the animals needs. At the end, it is smart to give the students opportunities to reflect on what they would have done differently or have a mini critique and talk about ""glows"" for their classmates. * Spend the time to see how your lessons will work. If you do not feel comfortable teaching something live, record a video or create a step-by-step presentation with pictures you take along the way. I have noticed that having the step-by-step pictures either way is a huge help for students whose internet is not the greatest. If you put these pictures into a presentation or ""printable"" worksheet, you can use them as a teaching tool when you return to the classroom. * Look on Pinterest, Teachers Pay Teachers, and Instagram for ideas. You do not have to purchase anything, but this will at least give you some starting points for some lessons if you are stuck. * Remember that you are AWESOME and whatever you do will be exciting for the students! Focus on building student relationships at the beginning of the year. It is okay to have virtual ""lunch bunches"" with students that need some extra support, but remember to only commit to time you are comfortable with. * Keep a routine when you teach your lessons that will translate over to the classroom. For example, you could have a quick review of class expectations (1 min), review of the learning target or lesson for the day, demonstration or inspiration, studio, clean up, reflect (easy as thumbs up, sideways, or thumbs down or rating how successful the students feel on a scale from 1 - 5 ---- This let us you know who you need to check in with the following week). That is all I can think of right now, but if you have more specific questions, do not hesitate to ask.",usually like project planned time class example teaching it grade drawing lesson start planning next lesson painting collage etc soon begin teaching much work plan thing advance unless start time summer first year teacher lot work year feel overwhelming normal get easier year add lesson plan resource tool kit year starting bit different suggest making lesson easily adapted go back classroom setting last spring posting asynchronous lesson week teaching class day synchronous specialist require help classroom teacher co teach allowed u work together help figure application monitor chat county using blackboard collaborate ultra synchronous teaching lesson asked use blackboard finally got approval google classroom using student distance learning happy go back switch purchase future self drawing lesson see step step instruction suggestion use pallet month pay account get free pallets time want try first google classroom presentation student found virtual room best way organize everything help student main suggestion planning think population student curriculum interest plan bunch and grader love animal learning habitat homeroom create fun art project incorporates art standard engaging student could show student lot picture different type habitat animal inspiration discover new animal type feature would creature survive environment would create creature give name draw collage paint sculpt habitat thinking animal need end smart give student opportunity reflect would done differently mini critique talk glow classmate spend time see lesson work feel comfortable teaching something live record video create step step presentation picture take along way noticed step step picture either way huge help student whose internet greatest put picture presentation printable worksheet use teaching tool return classroom look pinterest teacher pay teacher instagram idea purchase anything least give starting point lesson stuck remember awesome whatever exciting student focus building student relationship beginning year okay virtual lunch bunch student need extra support remember commit time comfortable keep routine teach lesson translate classroom example could quick review class expectation min review learning target lesson day demonstration inspiration studio clean reflect easy thumb sideways thumb rating successful student feel scale let u know need check following week think right specific question hesitate ask

ElementaryTeachers,"I did not go to school for education, and instead got a BFA in painting and an MFA in visual art. Depending upon the needs of your area, you may be able to be hired on a provisional license and pursue your professional studies courses while teaching, which will allow your provisional license to be converted to a full license. That Is what I Am doing. I Have worked in museums and been a substitute teacher, and entered a certificate program at a local university to do the Ed classes I needed. In February I got hired to teach elementary art full time. I Am finishing up the last classes I need in the next couple of semesters, at which point my 3 year provisional will convert to a 10 year full license. In my area, its hard to find good art teachers apparently, and my educational background and experience as a substitute helped me qualify for the positions I applied for. Just make sure you have a really firm grasp on classroom management, because that is the one thing I Have felt makes a huge difference between being effective or frustrated as a new teacher, regardless of if you went to school for education or not. And when you interview with principals, they absolutely will want you to demonstrate that you can manage the kids- *especially* if you do not have a degree in education.",go education instead got bra painting mfa visual art depending upon need area may able hired provisional license pursue professional study course teaching allow provisional license converted full license worked museum substitute teacher entered certificate program local university ed class needed february got hired teach art full time finishing last class need next couple semester point year provisional convert year full license area hard find good art teacher apparently educational background experience substitute helped qualify position applied make sure really firm grasp classroom management one thing felt make huge difference effective frustrated new teacher regardless went education interview principal absolutely want demonstrate manage kid especially degree education

No mask requirement for children, school will not close if county does, sharing teachers if necessary due to no sub list this year. Its going to be a shit show!

ElementaryTeachers,"My favorite is Magic Playdoh (I teach 2nd). Its a ball of white Playdoh with a smaller ball of colored Playdoh hidden in the middle. Each child is given a baggie with the Playdoh inside and a note that says this attached: Magic Playdoh, oh so white / I wish I may, I wish I might / if a color should appear / its going to be a great school year! The kids roll and press and squish the Playdoh around and soon a color appearsI tell them to keep squishing until the white is mostly gone and the Playdoh is a new color. Then I have them make a sculpture of their favorite thing to play. There is so much excitement and its magical. It really helps to calm nerves and start the year off in a fun way. You can find it on TPT or Pinterest with recipes for salt dough and infusing the white dough with food coloring, but that just makes everyone is hands colorful. Frankly, I found it really easy and less time-consuming to buy Sargent Art Art Time Dough in white on Amazon. I buy 3 tubs and have more than enough for 30 kids with a ball about as big as their fists. Then I buy the small colored Playdoh containers (about 3 oz.) in the Target Dollar Spot or on Amazon. They work great and avoiding food coloring is a win!

I got a lot of complete or almost complete sets off of ebay years ago. 2nd graders still like Junie B. Jones, and some still like Magic Tree House. Send home Scholastic flyers next year to start earning those bonus points, though I find their books are not made as well. They fall apart easily. Also, think about your book loaning system and how you will handle that. I found and started a digital library with an app to check out real books. However, it is awkward and not as fast as my little index card box with a little ""file"" for each kid. Every book has one of the old fashioned library book pockets with an index card with the book's title on it. No need for kids to sign the cards. They just hand them to you and you put the card in their little file (by student number so you only have to do it once). Then when they return, you retrieve the cards from their pocket, match it up to the books, and reshelve the books. You can train 2nd graders to put the cards back in their own books and it was a classroom job for 2 ""librarians"" to reshelve the books during book shopping time or the end of the day (all my books had labels clearly marking where they go.) Of course, Covid modified the way I did this this year, but it is still a good system. Whew...sorry that was so much. My classroom library is kind of a point of pride with me.

ElementaryTeachers,"To my knowledge, your master's degree likely does not have to have any type of licensure tied to it. It will, of course, mostly likely have to be an accredited program (but you knew that). If you were already employed, I would tell you to call your HR department and ask what kinds of master's programs they will accept for movement on the salary schedule. They would be able to tell you which ones would work and which would not. For example, my district states we can do whatever program we want, so long as it is accredited and the degree relates somewhat to our content. I teach elementary and I got my master's in educational technology, for example. I would assume one that would NOT work would be, say, a science teacher getting a master's degree in French Literature. As far as your worry about the licensure or endorsement, I would not worry about this. I have honestly never heard of such a thing. Just get your credential after your bachelor's and you will be fine as far as teaching goes. Then decide what master's you want to get. By that time, if you already have a job, then you can start asking around regarding specific degrees and programs.

ElementaryTeachers,"Agree with the above. I Have taught 1-5th grades. One year I went from teaching 4th to teaching 1st - reverse of what you are wanting. Agree about the sense of humor - and its very effective in relationship building with the students. They like to feel like you trust them with their learning. Show them you truly believe in them and they will far exceed their own expectations. Big difference between a 1st and 4th grader is they KNOW the difference. If you tell a 1st grader I know you can do it they will believe you even if you are just saying it. Fourth graders? Not a chance. They KNOW whether you believe it and they will call you out on it. In a nutshell: 1. Above all else, foster trusting relationships with the students - this will help with classroom management- because they will start to push the boundaries. (1st graders love you no matter what, 4th graders. Are a little more discerning) 2. Give them some independence - they are ready for it. They Are also able to think more abstractly and critically which can make learning so fun! 3. Begin your year touting the importance of kindness - girl drama is real at this age 4.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi! I taught second grade for a year and now 4th grade for 6 years. Academically, 4th graders are ready for more independence. Not TOTAL independence, but definitely less hovering. Most importantly, they are super 100% ready for more in-depth collaborative projects that the little guys could never pull off. In my room, we have book clubs, where each kid has a job and they read a chapter of the book together, on their own, without a teacher present (or, I mean, with the teacher across the room). Nobody can do their job without everybody else, so they have to hold each other accountable. We do something similar in math, where kids work on their own on a problem that is just a *little* too hard, then come together after a certain amount of time to see if they can figure out how to solve it. Socially, they are ready for more responsibility! I definitely push the how do you solve this problem? (Like...an argument with your friend) off on them more than I did in the little grades. Sometimes, if they do something foolish, I air them down and ask them what they think their consequence should be (depends on what they did, though). Fourth graders are also have a way better sense of humor than the little guys (they get way more jokes) so its easy to make everything funny and boom they are engaged.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hey there, &amp;#x200B; I am a 4th grade teacher. I had a 3rd grader and a 5th grader at home with me when we went remote. I am a good parent and a good teacher. My kids just rejected me as their teacher. We fought pretty regularly and they did not put in the same effort that I know they put in when they are in class. The student teacher relationship, especially at that age is still one where the student has the mindset that whatever their teacher says is the right thing to do and something that they need to follow to a T. 4th grade is a really important year for taking skills in 3rd grade and expanding them. In third grade you multiply, in 4th you multiply 4 digits by 1 and 2 digits by 2 digits. With regards to reading practice practice practice. Read everyday and it gets easier. You might really hate this but the Common Core Standards are a guide for what they should be learning during the year. Most people are pretty intimidated by / unknowledgeable about them. But what they generally break down to is a skill that a child should be able to do. For example. 4.nbt.b.4 Breaks down to 4th grade, Numbers in Base 10 (this is generally going to be how do you compute with number), B (honestly know idea why they differentiate b from a here), 4 - this is the fourth item on the list. 4.nbt.b.4 reads: Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm. .... All this means is that students can add and subtract the regular way. This is a lot different than what most people think of when they think of Common Core. \- Reading Gr 4: [http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/4/](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/4/) \- Writing Gr 4: [http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/W/4/](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/W/4/) \- Math Gr 4: [http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/introduction/](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/introduction/) Click around on the side bar on the right for more clarification.

ElementaryTeachers,"I have been in 4th for a few years and I really like it. Its an interesting grade because you have half the class still in the imagination based play world and the other half of the class interested in walking and talking and socializing. This can be hard for a lot of kids who quite literally see their friends walking away from them when they are not ready to move on. They will still work hard for you which is one of my favorite things about elementary kids. Even the ones that are struggling still give effort. They have not really had the hormones kick in yet which is nice. You may have a few who do by the end of the year but for the most part I think the bigger changes start to happen in the second half of 5th grade. They may present like they are understanding what you are talking about but things do need to be a bit more clear than you may first expect. This is a huge growing year just all around. I would not use too much sarcasm as they probably will not really get it.

It is being a mom when there is a need, a nurse when needed, a mandated reporter when needed. I fell absolutely in love with my students and how the light bulbs would go off when they understood something. The trouble makers, the nose pickers, the assholes.

ElementaryTeachers,"It is the first day of school, and the teacher does not know the kids in the class or what they are like. The seating is based on a lot of factors you do not know about, and we do not just seat students with behaviour challenges at the front of the class. We seat based off of **legally protected** IEPs, and if a child has an accomodation to be at the front or the back or away from reflective materials or windows, we abide by that. Even if kids had poor behaviour the year before, we do not like to label kids as ""bad"" first off because behaviour can change as they age or over the summer. Also, I strongly take issue to your statement ""the few kids that can excel"" because **all kids have potential** and it is not genetically determined that some will and some will not. While you are looking out for the best interests of your one child, the teacher is trying to create a positive learning environment for *all* 20-30 students in the class. This includes not labelling some as bad or unable to learn. The other thing we work on is teaching children to be assertive and manage their own social-emotional regulation in school. Your daughter may actually benefit from sitting next to a less-preferred seatmate and having some coaching on how to work on telling her peers if they are annoying her or being rude, especially as she gets older, and how to problem solve. Do not project your own experiences on your daughter, and do not forget that schools have changed massively.

There are other ways to satisfy these requirements, but I found it easier just to take the tests rather than dig up my old SAT score and whatnot.

Choose a few that you like or have researched, then check when applications for the next instruction period are open. I suggest starting the application process as soon as you are able because different programs require different things such as prerequisite courses or certain certifications like CPR and livescan.

ElementaryTeachers,"Do Not be afraid to take a centering moment in the middle of the class. For example, take some deep breaths before beginning a lesson or lecture. Once students begin independent work sit at your desk for a minute to collect yourself and take some more breaths before getting up and moving to check on and help students. Drink your comfort beverage of choice throughout the day (coffee, tea, water soda or a combination) even better if you put it in a cute cup or mug. Get the kids moving or transitioning through the block via brain breaks or group work or a gallery walk or anything. They would appreciate the break too and it gives you a break as well. If you are having disciplinary or management issues take a few breaths before addressing it to calm yourself and avoid over reacting or yelling or anything unproductive.

ElementaryTeachers,"&gt;1. What grade level do you teach and what standards are you using? I teach grade 2 and I use the British National Curriculum for Literacy, and the Australian Maths curriculum. For Social Studies/Science I use IPC. &gt;2. What kinds of diverse learners are in your class this year? One autistic student, two EAL learners, and one anxious student so far (from last year's assessment). We will see what else I have next week. A lot is caught in Grade 2. &gt;3. How do you assess which students are diverse learners? Data data data. I do a preliminary basic assessment in the first weeks with observation and tracking (looking for difficulties writing, listening, doing math, with behaviour, inconsistencies between subjects, sensory red flags, and following directions) and then I have a basic referral form that asks for more detail and examples. I also have a writing and math diagnostic assessment that is a hodgepodge. I have some OG materials for reading. I also talk to parents. &gt;4. How would you describe the health and wellness of your students? Good. They are generally higher SES as it is private schooling. Some are emotionally neglected to some degree. Most have poor diets (sugary snacks, all carbs). Some are not active enough. &gt;5. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness at school? Lack of consistency due to covid is the big one. &gt;6. What negatively impacts the students health and wellness outside of school? Lack of activity, sometimes poor parental engagement or the flip side, too much parental engagement. My students tend to lack independence and problem-solving skills. &gt;7. How do you, as the teacher, support the health and wellness of the students? We educate on SEL, diet, and incorporate movement in. We have a routine. &gt;8. What activities do you incorporate to support your diverse learners? Daily multiple movement breaks, routine, explicit SEL curriculum (Second Step), and lots of encouragement. &gt;9. What do you wish you had known and prepared for as a teacher of diverse learners? I really think education programs should do more on disabilities and how to accomodate and read/build an IEP. Less siloed specialities would be better - there is no reason a classroom teacher should not incorporate basic OT, SLP, etc.",it grade level teach standard using teach grade use british national curriculum literacy australian math curriculum social study science use ipc it kind diverse learner class year one autistic student two eal learner one anxious student far last year assessment see else next week lot caught grade it ass student diverse learner data data data preliminary basic assessment first week observation tracking looking difficulty writing listening math behaviour inconsistency subject sensory red flag following direction basic referral form asks detail example also writing math diagnostic assessment hodgepodge og material reading also talk parent it would describe health wellness student good generally higher i private schooling emotionally neglected degree poor diet sugary snack carbs active enough it negatively impact student health wellness lack consistency due couid big one it negatively impact student health wellness outside lack activity sometimes poor parental engagement flip side much parental engagement student tend lack independence problem solving skill it teacher support health wellness student educate sel diet incorporate movement routine it activity incorporate support diverse learner daily multiple movement break routine explicit sel curriculum second step lot encouragement it wish known prepared teacher diverse learner really think education program disability accomodate read build pep le silted speciality would better reason classroom teacher incorporate basic ot slip etc

ElementaryTeachers,"With the upper grades, I keep a binder called the ""Choices Book."" Students each have a numbered section to flip to for their personal log. They log ""glows"" and ""grows,"" so if an individual is sent to the log, others do not always know if it is a positive ""glow"" or a consequence (room to grow). The log includes date, what happened, and reward/consequence. If they need to work on something, like walking instead of running or respecting others, they take a colored ""choices ticket"" (1/4 sheet of paper with lines) and fill it out with what choice they made (bad behavior) and how they will work on making a better choice next time. Depending on the infraction, they may need a parent signature on their ticket. Since the students are responsible for their own logs, this is a great tool to have at conferences to show parents or SSP teams how the behavior in class is. When students get 3 glows, they get to choose from the prize box. For the lower grades, I like using Class Dojo. I do not show points to the whole class, but boy do kids respond when they hear the +1 sounds and the -1 sound. I like this free online program as I can use my phone or computer and update points from anywhere in the room. Center time, if they hear a good chime, they all smile and get focused and working.

ElementaryTeachers,"So in principle, I do agree. Being punitive rarely leads to wholesale change, and there are no doubt places where the consequence is disproportionate to the behaviour. The thing is though, that there is a middle ground between ""chewing gum"" and ""guns and drugs."" Chronic disruption, for instance. Vandalism. Racial or homophobic insults. In Ontario, any of these would be reasons to consider suspension, though mitigating factors should be considered. Plus, honestly, kids are sometimes suspended because the teacher and/or the rest of the class need a break.",principle agree punitive rarely lead wholesale change doubt place consequence disproportionate behaviour thing though ground chewing gum gun drug chronic disruption instance vandalism racial homophobic insult ontario would reason consider suspension though mitigating factor considered plus honestly kid sometimes suspended teacher rest class need break

ElementaryTeachers,"IDK, I think the subjective assumption of shaming might be a bit much. The teacher does not read out student names who *did not* get 100% with a score they got; the teacher only reads the names of successes. Publicly acknowledge a job well-done to those who earned it, and give everyone else an opportunity to try again for pride of accomplishment of being on the list of achievers next week. What Is the problem with that? Some teachers have treat jars or pool jars which encourage teamwork, some throw in a bit of friendly competition... My kids never got their 100% vocab tests back either; only when they missed any words so they (and the parents) would know which ones to spend extra time studying.",ink think subjective assumption shaming might bit much teacher read student name get score got teacher read name success publicly acknowledge job well done earned give everyone else opportunity try pride accomplishment list achiever next week problem teacher treat jar pool jar encourage teamwork throw bit friendly competition kid never got vocab test back either missed word parent would know one spend extra time studying

I was just saying that as a general statement. I believe, as part of a new way of approaching education, its not negative to see how far you can push education. It could be that the teacher felt the class, or maybe just a few of the children, could potentially handle this type of work. When my son was 7 the teacher just kept giving harder and harder assignments, in a fun manner, just see how high they could go. At first, i was apprehensive about it, but afterwards we realized how much more they can handle. I attribute that teacher to a lot of my sons early success in school. It helped him develop better study habits that were far beyond what i could have envisioned. I do see the concern or second guessing of such material. Also, i will add, the teacher could be doing this out of... spite, for a lack of a better word. In my opinion, if the teacher is just trying to push the limits, in a ""fun"" experimental way, its ok push for it.

In fact, the bilingual supplement and BTLPT is only required if you plan to teach in spanish and english. I have heard the btlpt is challenging for fluent speakers, and myself not being that great I chose to just do the mainstream route vs bilingual.

For example, I Am bilingual BUT my second language is not Spanish so yes I Am a bilingual person who could get a cert in bilingual education but my second language is not super common in most areas of a Texas. I do not know if that helped at all. There is a big difference between the ESL cert and bilingual one though. We had a teacher who was bilingual and had the bilingual cert but did not have the ESL one (it was not mandatory at the time) and she was not allowed to have ESL kids. She had much smaller classroom sizes than the rest of the team (she had 18 and we were all pushing 22-24) but the years following our admin required all teachers to obtain the Esl cert.",always told bilingual teach certified bilingual example bilingual second language spanish yes bilingual person could get cert bilingual education second language super common area texas know helped big difference esl cert bilingual one though teacher bilingual bilingual cert esl one mandatory time allowed esl kid much smaller classroom size rest team pushing year following admin required teacher obtain esl cert

However, I just heard about the BTLPT from a family friend and she stated she did have to do written, oral, etc. in english and spanish. Also that in [some] interviews you may have to be able to prove you are capable of spanish speaking. From my understanding the bilingual and BTLPT certification is required for elementary, and ESL for secondary.

AND YES, I have also heard that many school districts are now wanting teachers to be bilingual or ESL certified but I do not know if IT IS a requirement. I know of a few elementary teachers that have had a hard time passing these two tests and have not lost their jobs til this day. I would totally go for it though. It will make your application stand out and they will probably hire without questioning you too much in an interview.

If you prefer online go CalStateTeach. Then study and take your CBEST, and Multiple Subject CSETs. You will most likely need this in order to apply for the credential program.

ElementaryTeachers,"Coincidentally, I have a biology degree and teach elementary! Not sure how much it is changed since I got my multi-subject credential (aka elementary) 21 years ago, but the typical route is to get accepted to a credentialing program, usually through a university - I went through San Francisco State University. It can last anywhere from 1-2 years depending on the pace of the program. They are not difficult to get into but it does cost significant money for tuition and you will be a full time student so it is tough to work a regular job simultaneously. There are various academic theory tests you must pass plus student teaching before getting your credential. Keep in mind that despite all the credential classes and student teaching, you will NOT be prepared for the rigor, chaos, and insanity of being a teacher - not even close! In rare cases, you can find an internship and teach your own class while doing your credential classes at night which is NOT easy and is absolutely exhausting as you might imagine. You would teach all day then go to classes until late at night. With this route, at least you get paid while earning your credential although it is very low pay on an auxiliary pay scale lower than a first year teacher. If you have not already done so, I would STRONGLY getting your feet wet by substitute teaching first. While it is nowhere close to being an actual full time elementary teacher, it will give at least a small taste of what the job entails. It is also a good way to get your ""feet in the door"" of districts that you may want to work for in the future. With the pandemic, getting a credential right now is a huge unknown. I do not know how you could possibly get experience working in classrooms right now so you would have to talk to the credential program leaders.

ElementaryTeachers,"Hi, I am about to start my sixth year, I am going to do my best answering these questions. * Can you pick what grade you teach? * Not often, but administration does try to accommodate with what you are comfortable with because you will do a better job there. When you are student teaching, some programs let you request a grade level. Whatever grade you spend the most time working with can show your preference and can help placement between guide upper or lower grades when looking for a job. * How do you know what type of curriculum you must teach? Is there anything you are given that helps you teach the lesson? * The state or school system will provide the curriculum and often has a ton of resources. I work for a bigger county, and there is a TON of support. Making friends with coworkers is huge; it is certainly a team effort when someone is in their first year. Everyone feels like they are floundering, but you are not. You will get it and be amazing! Tip: When going on interview, as principals if they have a mentoring/new teacher committee. * What Is the best way to plan activities/lessons? * That is a bit of a broad question. Be sure that your lessons completely align to the standard being taught. I realized after two years that I had not understood the standards to the degree necessary to teach. Look at the standards, map out a schedule, create the unit test, and teach with the end goal in mind. \*Do not teach the test, but teach the curriculum thoroughly. * Are there other things I should do before applying for any teaching position that would help? * Jump into your student teaching with the mindset of being hands-on. I was shy the first year of mine, and I feel like I missed out on a lot of learning opportunities. * How do you find out about open teaching positions? * Go to the county or school systems websites and fill out applications. Also, drop off resumes to the schools you really want to work at in person. It is okay to talk to people you know in the system. * What is the interview process like? * It depends on the school. They will call you in and there is usually some administration and possibly some teachers. * What if I have to call out of work for an emergency or that I Am sick? What do I or the school do? * The school will go over all this information at new teacher orientation at the county and school.",hi start sixth year going best answering question pick grade teach often administration try accommodate comfortable better job student teaching program let request grade level whatever grade spend time working show preference help placement guide upper lower grade looking job know type curriculum must teach anything given help teach lesson state system provide curriculum often ton resource work bigger county ton support making friend coworkers huge certainly team effort someone first year everyone feel like floundering get amazing tip going interview principal mentoring new teacher committee best way plan activity lesson bit broad question sure lesson completely align standard taught realized two year understood standard degree necessary teach look standard map schedule create unit test teach end goal mind teach test teach curriculum thoroughly thing applying teaching position would help jump student teaching mindset hand shy first year mine feel like missed lot learning opportunity find open teaching position go county system website fill application also drop resume school really want work person okay talk people know system interview process like depends call usually administration possibly teacher call work emergency sick go information new teacher orientation county

ElementaryTeachers,"Just my 2 cents: * When you do get an interview, I would suggest researching the school &amp; district history, student and family demographics for the school/district, and the district's educational philosophy in the days before the interview. It would also be helpful to know what reading/writing and math programs are used in the district and learn a bit about them before the interview if you are not already familiar. * I have been on multiple interview committees over the past 20 years and they have been held in various ways. Sometimes, it is a large group of principals and teachers in a large conference room at the district office. Other times it is just been at the school site in a small meeting room with just the principal and a few teachers. They will often ask you various questions from what makes an effective reading program to different behavioral scenarios and how you would handle them. There is usually between 10-15 questions. We have always end with ""Do you have any questions?"" so be prepared to ask questions as this part often tells more about a candidate than any of the other questions. * Right now it is a bit difficult with school closings but substituting is a great way to get to know a school and district as well as get your ""foot in the door"". My school has hired many good teachers that were former subs that built a good reputation.

ElementaryTeachers,"- you will he hired for a specific grade level not just generally by the school so ideally you can pick the grade by applying to positions that you want. - Most schools have a curriculum for at least reading and math and they are different all over the Country but whatever curriculum it is, you follow basically what the books tells you to do. Most curriculums have extra supplies, workbooks, homework sheet, etc. - you cannot plan anything until you know what curriculum you would be using but joining Facebook groups, following teachers on insta, and looking on Teacherspayteacher.com is extremely helpful to find fun ways to teach your lessons. - For applying you will need you are resume and cover letter for each school you apply to. The cover letter should talk about the schools mission or anything that they represent, while also selling yourself. That means you have to change the cover letter a bit for each school. Make sure you do basic research on the schools website in case they ask you anything about it. - I use Applitrack.com, not sure how popular it is in CA but usually you can type in (school district #) applitrack and you can fill out an application. This website it cool bc it will autofill your info if you apply to more than one school on applitrack. - interviewing is different everywhere, sometimes its just questions, sometimes they will want you to teach a lesson in front of them or something like that so it depends on school district. - each school is different about subs. I formed relationships with a few so that I was able to text them if I needed someone last minute but usually you just call in and they will assign a sub or there is usually a website to just input that you arw sick and it looks for subs in the district.

I only taught Math, Science, and Social Studies so I cannot speak to ELA. For math there will likely be a large range of students. I have students who could not count to 25 all the way up to students who could do basic double digit addition. The biggest thing is to build their basic number sense as a lot of students do not really understand numbers. I also got a lot of pressure to teach concepts like multiplication and division to challenge their students. Some parents do not understand that there is an appropriate sequence and that their 6 year old is not ready for multiplication just because they have memorized some multiplication facts. 1st grade was a lot of fun (I Am moving up to 5th next year) so I hope you enjoy it!",finishing it year it grade teacher expecting teach upper el well big adjustment biggest thing noticed it grade huge jump kindergarten expectation big adjustment taught math science social study cannot speak ela math likely large range student student could count way student could basic double digit addition biggest thing build basic number sense lot student really understand number also got lot pressure teach concept like multiplication division challenge student parent understand appropriate sequence year old ready multiplication memorized multiplication fact it grade lot fun moving the next year hope enjoy

ElementaryTeachers,"**Assess early and often and make referrals as needed for suspected learning or mental health disabilities - ask for support if you need it on spotting them. If they are not caught by grade 2 the damage to self esteem can be irreparable.** You will be doing a whole lot of literacy, which should ideally following a solid multisensory phonics-based approach with small group reading instruction built in in levelled grouos. You can support with sight words. Activities need to be kept short, light, and focused with lots of play built in and loads of repetition of the concept. You will likely use a levelled reading system but try not to focus overmuch on levels. Try to use decodable texts as much as possible. Read-alouds, think-alouds, modelled and shared writing, as well as independent reading and writing time are all important. You want to have a good balance. Keep an eye out for students who are having a hard time segmenting words into sounds and use a lot of visuals to support. You will spend most of the rest of the instructional time on maths. Again, lots of repetition, lots of physical manipulatives, lots of play-based learning if you can, and try to look into open-ended maths tasks with low floors and high ceilings. Number talks are great for this. If your school supports it, I would recommend trying to incorporate guided or small-group maths as well with levelled groups. Doubles and skip counting through games are great too. Start to give them choice as much as possible. You will need a solid solid solid daily routine (I like to start with morning meeting and calendar to drive home a literacy and maths approach, songs and poems, and a daily SEL focus. The Mojo videos are like 2-3 minutes long and the kids love them!) Then you will shoehorn in art, music, and PE, depending on how your specials break down. You might get a little science or social studies but really, you will have to use maths or literacy to get most of that in. Your big thing is ROUTINES. Expect to spend a week teaching them routines at the beginning of the year. Do not even bother with academics much. The kids need to know where to sit, where to put their things, how to sit, how to go to the bathroom, when is snack, how to wait, where to get pencils, how to transition, how to quiet down, how to ask for help, how to be independent in these routines, and how to walk in a damn line. (They will not do this.) I am serious - we practiced at least 2x a week, and I teach grade 2! Kids love incentives - fill a jar with pompoms for a choice activity, or do a chart indicating growth and give stickers. I also do laminated paper strips for rewards - get ten and you can trade them in for sitting with a buddy during snack, or save to 20 to trade for a small prize. Save 50 for a big prize. Etc. Expect to reteach these routines CONSTANTLY through the year. After each break. Daily. Be gentle and kind but firm. Additional things to watch for this year and embed into the beginning: fine motor and pencil grasp. Video your kids' hands and really look at their grasp. For students with poor FM skills try to refer or remediate as much as possible early on. If you have an OT on staff or available have them set up some activities for the kids to do in down time or incorporate them into guided groups. Gross motor: use movement activities to strengthen midline crossing and core strength. Go Noodles are great. Body breaks are the best. Alternative seating is the bomb. Finally, always end the day on a good note. Story time, telling (bad) jokes, an award or praise once everyone is organized is such a great way to finish up the day.

I would also STRONGLY recommend WGU, which is an online college. It is the one I personally graduated from. It is completely self-paced and it is easy to accelerate your degree if you put the work into it. You pay by semester (6 month term) at a flat rate and get credit for as many courses as you complete. It is also only like 3k per semester, iirc.

If you live in one of those states, you need to be open to relocating. Teaching is an incredibly rewarding job but you have to be really committed to it and ***passionate*** about it or you will quickly be burnt out. You need a growth mindset and be okay with constant PD, often self-administered rather than provided by your school. You need to be open to trying new things, always. I have worked with plenty of teachers who look at a method that is proven effective and say ""Well that is just not my style"".... that is not the right mindset to have in this career. Also, if you want a homey and well-furnished classroom, you need to be willing to invest your own $$ if your school/district does not provide funding for that (most do not). I see tons of teachers complain about spending their money on their rooms but I mean, no one made them, and it is common knowledge -- we all go into this career ***knowing*** that funding usually is not provided and that most teachers fund their own classrooms.

ElementaryTeachers,"I Am now entering my 5th year of classroom teaching and making 50k this school year. I started at 38k, and before that I was working at a nonprofit teaching in different schools every week for 25k. I will not ever say that I Am still doing teaching because of the money, but on hard days, its a thought that crosses my mind. I usually work around 65 hours a week and its exhausting. Now that I Am in my 5th year, I think I will have a better handle on work-life balance, but also last year my role changed halfway through and I spent the entire school year teaching from home. I could not even try to leave work at work. I tell friends my dream job is a job where I sit at a desk - maybe in a cubicle - and answer phone calls, write emails, and occasionally clean out the microwave and then go home. Id suggest finding a administrative job for now - I Am sure your interviews have gone well - and then decide what you want to do. You could also apply for some paraprofessional jobs at schools - or even look to see about some administrative jobs at schools. After a year or two, I Am sure you will have a better idea of what you want. I think you should also try to reframe I Am not doing what I Am meant to do because that does not seem healthy. Maybe what do you feel like you are meant to do? Why? Then make it more general and see how you can still do that in other roles (at least for now.)",entering the year classroom teaching making i year started i working nonprofit teaching different school every week i ever say still teaching money hard day thought cross mind usually work around hour week exhausting the year think better handle work life balance also last year role changed halfway spent entire year teaching home could even try leave work work tell friend dream job job sit desk maybe cubicle answer phone call write email occasionally clean microwave go home id suggest finding administrative job sure interview gone well decide want could also apply paraprofessional job school even look see administrative job school year two sure better idea want think also try reframe meant seem healthy maybe feel like meant make general see still role least

ElementaryTeachers,"So many positivesyou love the kids, your admin says you are good and they are happy with your work, you have an amazing mentor teacher who helps you out so much, and you love your colleagues. Could it be that your expectations are too high? Every child will not end their year with you excited about Reading and Writing and doing it successfully. How are you measuring success? You say you spend hours trying to plan effective lessons to make sure ALL of my students get equal opportunity to learn the skills. Move away from the word all. Its simply not going to happen. For hundreds of reasons, even the best, most experienced teachers with engaging, effective plans will not reach every student. Its not because they failed. Its because too many other things affect learninghome life, cognitive skills, whether a child had a good breakfast...you just cannot solve every problem. So please try to relax, and lower your expectations for yourself and the kids. Focus on all the positivesyou are so lucky to have them. Cut the hours of planning. Measure your success differentlyare most of the kids engaged and learning? Good! That Is enough. Remember, you may never know the effects you may be having on a child. They may not show any success in your class at the time, but maybe years later they will say you were their favorite teacher, and you are the reason they love Reading. And the biggest reason of all to just sit back and not make any sudden changes when it sounds like you are a wonderful teacher...your teaching career started and continues during the most abnormal, difficult and unprecedented time ever in the lives of your students, their parents, and you.

ElementaryTeachers,"Oh its a shit show out here. Here are my opinions on why teachers are not getting jobs right now: we just do not know what parents are going to do because of this delta variant. And we cannot pay teachers unless we have students enrolled. In my district, teacher cuts for low enrollment happen in the Spring. So if you are offered a contract now, and the students withdraw/disenroll, they still have you under contract and have to pay you/find a place for you to work. But it IS possible that we are already over-staffed... School here does not start until September, so my best guess is hiring frenzy in August. There is also substitute teaching as a way to get your foot in the door. But we both know that is no benefits and not a living wage. Last year we did remote than hybrid. Parents are not going to go for that again. And you have both camps: parents who do not want them face to face because of the varient, parents who will send their kids to schoolbut not with a mask and some parents who will only send their kids if they all wear masks. The ONLY teachers I have heard of getting jobs are in Special Education. So we wait. Hope the Delta/Lambda Greek alphabet of COVID goes away and schools can open so teachers can teach. If you have a Masters Degree, you can potentially teach at the community college level (maybe even some early childhood education courses??).
