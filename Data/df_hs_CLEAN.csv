highschoolteachers,"I am a high school science teacher in Florida at a public school. We only offer Spanish and only have a Spanish club (no other foreign languages). Our students also only get exposed to Spanish in middle school. We also do not have anyone who comes to talk about study abroad.

highschoolteachers,"Here is my view. I know it is going to be unpopular, and I am pretty sure it is not going to change any minds, but here it is. I do not think a high school coach should worry about having a winning team or making the playoffs. Yes, of course, encourage the students to strive for that, train them, motivate them, help them. Do everything you can to get the students there, because you are teaching them appropriate skills while you do so. I know you also mentioned a course overload, but the first thing you mentioned was football, and your disappointment in the quality of your team. You mention your courseload, but almost as an aside. It seems to me that football is your most important criterion. But the team is not **for** you. It is for the students. If you have a football team of 30 motivated kids who do their best and still enjoy the game but end up with losing seasons year after year, *you have done your job.* The team is not meant to be a means for you to express your superior coaching skills to your coaching colleagues, it is meant to teach the kids the value of teamwork, to provide a physical fitness opportunity and a physical outlet, to teach leadership and followership and sportsmanship. But at the end of the day, it is an *extra*curricular activity. No one needs it to graduate. Imagine if an English teacher decided to move on because the debate team just could not win debates. Or the science teacher moved on because the robotics team's robots did not win competitions. If the coach of my son's football team left because the team was not competitive, I would be glad to see him go.",view know going unpopular pretty sure going change mind think coach worry winning team making playoff yes course encourage student strive train motivate help everything get student teaching appropriate skill know also mentioned course overload first thing mentioned football disappointment quality team mention courseload almost aside seems football important criterion team student football team motivated kid best still enjoy game end losing season year year done job team meant mean express superior coaching skill coaching colleague meant teach kid value teamwork provide physical fitness opportunity physical outlet teach leadership followership sportsmanship end day extra curricular activity one need graduate imagine english teacher decided move debate team could win debate science teacher moved robotics team robot win competition coach son football team left team competitive would glad see go

highschoolteachers,I like the age group better. They are energetic and excitable. They are figuring themselves out and they are going through puberty (which brings about its own unique challenges lol). Their brains are still developing and they usually are not jaded yet. I taught in high school and hated it; I have been doing middle schools for 5 years now and I love it. It is not always bad to be teaching something you are not 100% comfortable with. It is a nice challenge and pulls you out of your comfort zone. I used to teach 8th when I started (physical science) and it forced me to learn new things and challenge myself.,like age group better energetic excitable figuring going puberty brings unique challenge lol brain still developing usually jaded yet taught hated school year love always bad teaching something comfortable nice challenge pull comfort zone used teach the started physical science forced learn new thing challenge
highschoolteachers,"My district did PBL for about 4 years, beginning with 4th/5th grades and working up to 9th grade. The year that the 9th grade cohort did PBL (students who had done PBL classes through middle school), it fell apart completely. They got to high school, where credits and state testing affect graduation, and it turns out that a ton of the students were way behind on basic skills. When it was implemented at the high school, most of the teachers, even for non-PBL subjects, thought it was a bad idea, because it was full PBL, on graduation-tested subjects. High-performing students complained about it. Low-performing students passed units and failed exams (both district and state). The program was scrapped at the end of the year. I teach art, which by its very nature is PBL. Projects are great, allow for hands-on demonstration and real-world connections. The issue is when students lack the fundamental basic skills necessary to do the task. All of my units have indepedent practice, teacher-led demonstrations, follow-me type activities, and guided brainstorming before the project begins. Students know what the long-term goal is before all of these activities begin, so that they know the reason that they are being required to, for example, draw all of the parts of the face separately. Thinking about my students and their classes, and my experience as a student in AP classes, I would be really surprised if all of them can actually be trusted to work collaboratively. I have one student this year who is highly gifted, very smart, but is the biggest bully and slacker in my class. He is borderline failing due to his behavior. In my opinion, it would be better to simply incorporate more real-world projects into the existing curriculum in place of some of the higher-level independent activities that you would normally use. Additionally, the fewer group projects, the better (in my biased opinion). Group projects allow students to hide their lack of comprehension until it is too late, and over-burdens the students who want to get good grades.",district pal year beginning the the grade working the grade year the grade cohort pal student done pal class fell apart completely got credit state testing affect graduation turn ton student way behind basic skill implemented teacher even non pal subject thought bad idea full pal graduation tested subject performing student complained low performing student passed unit failed exam district state program scrapped end year teach art nature pal project great allow hand demonstration real world connection issue student lack fundamental basic skill necessary task unit independent practice teacher led demonstration follow type activity guided brainstorming project begin student know long term goal activity begin know reason required example draw part face separately thinking student class experience student ap class would really surprised actually trusted work collaborative one student year highly gifted smart biggest bully slacker class borderline failing due behavior opinion would better simply incorporate real world project existing curriculum place higher level independent activity would normally use additionally fewer group project better biased opinion group project allow student hide lack comprehension late burden student want get good grade

No. Do you know of any groups or organizations that come into your school to advertise exchange or study abroad programs?

highschoolteachers,"My first career was 4 years (20-24) at an ad agency. I worked there during my last year of college and then graduated right before I turned 21. I liked it but hated it. Advertising can be engaging and interesting, but it is soul-sucking. It paid better. I still do some work on the side sometimes for events and such. I am teaching now but before we changed states (really can make a difference), I had to quit for a few years. I worked in HR/Event Management for a company, and it was an awesome job -- a lot of autonomy, work from home, flex time (salaried but if I had to work 60 hours for a big event, I got the 20 hours back wherever it made sense/I wanted). When we moved, I heard the union in my district was decent (it is, and this matters so *much* to the quality of life as a teacher, I feel), so tried my hand at teaching again. I really like teaching for the lack of continuity (each year is a new thing); doing the same thing for too long does not work for me. The events job worked this way too, to a degree -- there were seasons and booms and slow periods and a sort of re-set at Christmas time -- but not as much, especially with the paperwork. I do not know -- I do not necessarily see myself teaching forever, so I have resolved myself to become an AP. The school calendar just makes sense to me somehow. As to your needs, I do not know: I teach English, but teaching does not feel related to my English degree at all. I imagine the same thing happens to Physics teachers. Granted, I teach middle (switching to high) so maybe that will seem different next year in high school, but I am not counting on it being about literature and writing and not 90% about coaching and classroom management. I think teaching is basically a people business, not a content business. Do you like dealing with people? Do you like problem solving? Are you good at convincing reluctant people to do what you want?

I hugged another crying 6th grader because his friend spit water on him. Then he laughed because I inadvertently touched his friend's spit by hugging him. Then there were four more that wanted hugs and joking about water-spitting. Feminist discussion followed immediately by spit jokes (sometimes fart jokes) THEY ARE AMAZING. And all so different.

highschoolteachers,"""as for parabolas, well, grenades travel on them. And no you do not need to understand them in order to throw one, but there is still relevance."" Oh brother, that is a stretch if I ever saw one. Good grammar and punctuation have relevance in everyday life too, but people still manage to communicate effectively even without putting the appropriate apostrophe in conjunctions, or without capitalizing the first letter of every sentence, so why do we bother teaching those things? Continuity can only truly exist of grades and GPAs are completely eliminated, and we convert to a pass fail system. That is the only sure way to guarantee that when a student has completed a course, they have fully mastered every applicable concept within that relative course. Educational institutions realize that the concept of continuity is impractical because, like I said earlier, students are 3-dimensional beings, and are not all equivalent. A room full of students in the same room, hearing the same lecture, given the same materials, and the same amount of time to complete assignments, will yield wildly differing outputs, regardless of the common inputs. That is why education institutions use what is called overlapping curriculum. Which is to say, that the last few chapters of Pre-Algebra are re-taught in the first year of Algebra 1, and the last few chapters of Algebra 1 are taught in the first year of Geometry (generally speaking) and the last few chapters of Geometry are taught in the first year of Algebra II. And ultimately, that is probably why the last two years of high school are often taught in the first two years of college. I am still having a really good laugh about your grenade comment.

highschoolteachers,"I used to. Before I started teaching 8th grade, I thought of middle school as kind of like ""minor league"" for high school teachers.

Now I realize that it is a different kind of challenge that requires a different kind of teacher.

highschoolteachers,"I did my student teaching at summer school with blocks that were 2 1/2 hours. There was me, another student teacher from my program, the mentor teacher, and the biggest class was four high school kids, all on various levels.

The mentor teacher just sort of chilled, and me and the other student teacher sort of took over, despite having no real clue what we were doing (we are both alt certified and had a grand total of 2 weeks of training before student teaching). It was a blast. I took the two 1st semester US history kids. I showed them a powerpoint with stories and videos to cover the chapter we were covering for the day right off. They did a worksheet or two that the mentor teacher required. Then we did content specific writing exercises, vocabulary crossword puzzles, and laid-back discussions. The block culminated with all of us getting back into a group and playing hangman using terms and concepts they had learned that day. When it was guessed, or the man was hung, they had to explain the word or event to the class. They loved it. One kid was wicked good at it. He drew a piece of candy and a surprisingly detailed map of France with a star over Paris. It was the Treaty of Paris.

highschoolteachers,"Classroom management is built on 3 areas: 1) structures/processes that work, 2) rapport, 3) instructional design that allows for 1 and 2 to do their job. The order of importance is the order I have them listed in, in my opinion, and in the opinion of most administrators I have worked with. Rapport matters, but what is crucial is a structure and process that works for the class. In elementary and high school, I would say the same things matter but would re-order the importance, putting instructional design at the top for HS, with rapport again 2nd, and structure last, whereas I would put rapport first in Elementary with structure 2nd and instructional again last (in a high-needs environment, HS needs look like MS needs though, like at the roughest of Title 1 HS, you get the downsides of MS and HS in one challenging ball). All 3 are very important at all grade levels, though. It sounds to me like what you need to be working on is structure and processes, as well as instructional design in general (and as it relates to management). Do not rely on your focus in the moment or the teachable moment as much in the day-to-day; build a cohesive structure. What do you want to see during bellwork? What do you want to see during lecture/whole group? What do you want to see during independent work? Group work? Workshop? How do kids ask questions? How should they answer? How do they get materials? Everything should be really planned and thought-through. It sounds as though you lack organization in terms of both management and planning. No one is ever 100% sure where all their 7th graders are on the scale of progression (for one thing, they can revert backwards or jump upwards almost instantaneously at that age) and if they say they are, they are either measuring it very broadly or lying.

highschoolteachers,"The world, unfortunately, is not as black and white as you would like it to be. A grade, particularly in public education, is more than simple content knowledge. It is a culmination of so many things that each teacher deems to be important for integration into the real world. I try to teach my kids to be lifelong learners, but not career students if that makes sense. I once stood on the same side of the argument that you are on right now. How can a student pass the class at all when they have such low proficiency in the subject? It just seems so crooked... Well, then I taught high school for five years. More specifically, I taught remedial education for 5 years in high school. I cannot speak for why colleges are offering more remedial courses. Could it be possible that they are trying to appeal to a broader student population consisting of older students who never completed high school and are trying to regain an education for themselves? It seems like you simply justify this query of yours with an unprecedented assumption that it is because high school teachers are slacking. My first managerial job in college was in pizza delivery. When I first started hiring, I asked my regional manager how to sift through the hundreds of applications we got every week. His response was "" make two stacks, one stack is applicants who did finish high school, and the other stack is simply ones who did not"" The ""one's who did not"" was usually a much bigger stack, and it automatically went in the garbage. I asked my manager if this was too harsh, because honestly, how much education do you really need to deliver pizzas? His response was that it is not about the academics, in his mind, it was more about which kids were able to follow rules and complete a program. Diplomas are so much more than just ""the next step to college."" Colleges even know that, that is why most accredited colleges even have their own entrance exams to assess proficiency, otherwise anyone with a diploma would automatically be granted admission. So, with all due respect, step off of your high horse. Could you pass the GED? Apparently, only 60% of high school grads and about 10% of grown adults over 30 can pass it as compared to previous years. Should not this be a testament to the worthlessness of the majority of things that are taught in high school and how they apply to the real world? Nevertheless, you cannot even stock shelves at Wal-Mart without a diploma or GED equivalent.

I have moved a few times, and I have never had trouble finding a job in ELA, especially once I had some experience and good recommendations. Especially with shortages beginning to bubble up in a lot of states and areas; not all areas have shortages, but many areas seem to have jobs. If it is an area with opportunities already evident, you will get a job no problem with your diverse experience.

highschoolteachers,"I teach junior high and high school social studies and I am known for giving quite a bit of homework in class. I believe that homework should reinforce what has been learned to help the student remember and understand the content. Sometimes I assign short essays and other times I assign worksheets that focuses on the vocabulary. Most of the work can be done in my class, but if you miss a day, it tends to be a pain to get caught up. I taught one year where I hardly assigned homework and it turned into a disaster. I had no idea that students did not understand the content, so they would bomb tests. Homework helps me tell where a student is sitting in my class and if they might need extra assistance. It also benefits the student academically: it can help boost a grade and reinforce what we have discussed in class. I do not think homework should be ""pointless"" but I do think it should be assigned appropriately. Outside of the academic benefit, it can be looked as a responsibility that prepares students for the real world. You will be assigned tasks throughout life with deadlines. If you do not complete the task by the assigned deadline, there can be consequences. An example is doing your taxes. If they are not done correctly by a certain day, you may have to pay a fine. You will have deadlines in your job and daily life, so it is our responsibility as teachers to help prepare students for such expectations.

highschoolteachers,"The lows are devastatingly low, the highs are mindblowingly high. You will have both, sometimes in the same day, with a lot of relentless grind and frustration in between. Teaching is like playing whack-a-mole for 8 hours a day. You are always thinking about fifteen different things, readjusting, solving problems, putting out fires, correcting, reteaching, making big and small decisions. It is mentally exhausting. Teaching is not like working in most other settings. You do not get to just quick run to the store, or meet up with a friend for a longer lunch, or even pull out your phone to quickly talk to the plumber whose services you need at your house. You can do those things during your prep, if you are not meeting with a student or doing a thousand other things. You can only run to the bathroom if someone else can watch your class, and in some schools you cannot even leave campus without telling the office or getting permission. You are always being watched. Everything you do, say, the way you do your hair, the fact that you wore two blue shirts last weekend, the cut you got from shaving, the joke you wanted to laugh at but think you caught yourself - they saw the twitch. Kids are very into the minutiae. They will notice, they will talk about you, they will tell stories about you to their friends and families. Some of those stories will even be true. The community at large will form certain expectations, assumptions, and ideals for you based on your profession. They will project their own hopes, fears, disappointments, successes, and concerns onto you, whether or not you have any face-to-face interaction with them whatsoever. If you are dealing with high school students, you will usually find that they get to take credit for their successes, but their failures are all on you. The parents will remind you, lest you forget. If you are teaching English, you will not be Robin Williams in DPS more than two or three times a year many years (although some years you will be from day one, and you will feel like a god/dess). You will not primarily spend your time discussing great literature and holding life-changing discussions. Prepare to love the re-re-re-re-re-re-reteaching of how to write a proper paragraph, you will be doing that sort of thing more often. You will drown in a sea of papers that need to be graded, and your eyes will glaze over when you read about the topic du jour for the 52nd time. You will stand in front of a room full of eyes and have absolutely no idea what to do with them. You will close the door after a long day, sink into your chair, and then realize you have no idea what you are doing the next day. You will have friends and family that get very upset about the fact that you are not going out with them, that you are ready for bed by 8 p.m., that you skip events because you need to grade or plan or go to conferences. Or because you just.will not.stop.talking.about.the.kids. (We all do it.)

highschoolteachers,"Have you tried videoing some of your class periods and watching it to see what went wrong? I am currently an instructional coach and this is really one of the best practices I can recommend. It allows you to see things that you would not normally see or be aware of. I can come into your classroom every day and observe and TELL you what I see- but seeing it yourself is so much more powerful. It really allows YOU to hone in on those mistakes and/or missed opportunities and formulate a plan of attack. Take heart, classroom management is something EVERY new teacher struggles with. It is a delicate balance and to some extent, does come with experience. I wish I could tell you there was a magic fix or a fail-proof behavior system. Not the case. NO TWO GROUPS are the same- a behavior management system or strategy that works beautifully with one group can fail miserably with another. Recognizing when what you are doing is not working and taking steps to correct it is important, but often easier said than done. Some teachers make the mistake of thinking that they have to stick hard and fast with the rules they set on day 1- even if those are failing miserably. Do not be afraid to make adjustments when things are not working. Have you tried talking with the kids and getting their input on what kind of classroom environment they would like to have, and what rules they would consider important? Often kids will feel like they have more buy-in if they have taken part in the process, rather than being handed an arbitrary set of rules by the teacher. My first year teaching, I was working with middle school (6,7,8th here in the US). I am an ESL teacher, and was also their RELA teacher. Behavior management with my 8th grade intermediate ELLs was my biggest struggle. Many days I would collapse on my couch in tears at the end of the day. Over the winter break, I resolved that I WOULD fix this. What I was doing was not working- I knew it, and so did the kids. Over the break I read up on a lot of different strategies and philosophies and systems- even reading into the psychology of it all too. I returned to the classroom, acted like it was day 1 all over again, and put my plan into action. We still had some bumps- but they were few and far between, and we made changes and adjustments as necessary. Pretty soon, the teacher that ran in-school suspension would bring me kids when his room was too full or he had to be out and did not have a sub. The year that began with the kids making me cry ended with me crying to see them go on to high school. You can turn these classes around, but it will take work.

highschoolteachers,"Mostly yes, but in my personal opinion is a culmination of their level of proficiency in things like classroom behavior, punctuality, responsibility, as well as the course content knowledge (at the high school level at least). For stepwise subjects like math, I generally have the option to give the kid a passing grade (so that they get the necessary credit to graduate) but recommend to their guidance counselor that they repeat the course again next year rather than move up to the next math. I honestly have some kids in my classes that genuinely give it their best but simply cannot gain satisfactory mastery of the subject knowledge. These kids are usually the exception, rather than the rule, but when I do come across these kids that genuinely try their hardest yet simply cannot apply this or that concept, my justification is as follows: Is it right for me to setback the life-altering accolade of a diploma for this hard-working and honest student, simply because they cannot master a subject that has such limited practical use in the majority of mainstream jobs on the market today? (a.k.a. Algebra) It should be noted that without mastery of the content, the ""passing"" grade I assign for these types of students is usually a D. But these students are 3-dimensional individuals, and often times their hopes and dreams hang on your discretion as a teacher, and several factors must be taken into account when assigning grades, including what ultimate effect a failure in that class will have on the student, and whether or not they truly deserve that ultimate consequence.",mostly yes personal opinion culmination level proficiency thing like classroom behavior punctuality responsibility well course content knowledge level least stewie subject like math generally option give kid passing grade get necessary credit graduate recommend guidance counselor repeat course next year rather move next math honestly kid class genuinely give best simply cannot gain satisfactory mastery subject knowledge kid usually exception rather rule come across kid genuinely try hardest yet simply cannot apply concept justification follows right setback life altering accolade diploma hard working honest student simply cannot master subject limited practical use majority mainstream job market today i algebra noted without mastery content passing grade assign type student usually student dimensional individual often time hope dream hang discretion teacher several factor must taken account assigning grade including ultimate effect failure class student whether truly deserve ultimate consequence

highschoolteachers,"That is what a certificate of attendance is. It essentially says that this kid come to school and sat in chairs for four years, but did not successfully meet the academic requirements to earn a diploma. The problem with that is the certificate is worth about as much as the paper it is printed on, and without a high school diploma, job options are severely limited. What *should* happen is colleges should stop accepting people with 1.0 (or less) GPAs and actually hold kids to an academic standard. Colleges/universities need/want money, student loans are insanely easy to obtain, schools do not have to worry about chasing down unpaid debt, and kids are programmed that their only path to success is college. Then, after they fail out freshman year, they owe thousands of dollars for an education they did not get. And I completely agree that students who do not know the difference between ""are"" and ""our"" is, to say the least, frustrating. I am blaming curriculum designers for that shit. Teachers are not supposed/allowed to teach grammar in isolation anymore (unless the kids are taking a state test on it), and papers are graded on ideas, not mechanics. Kids are supposed to pick up on proper grammar and mechanics through reading. Clearly, that is worked. /s Needless to say, my first project is about commonly misused words. I do not teach it.

highschoolteachers,"What sorts of readings have you offered that are contemporary? It can be very hard to encourage kids to learn who have absolutely no motivation to do the work. I see this every day at my high school and it is sad. The worst thing is that many of these students were simply passed from grade to grade. Teachers are pressured to move students along to make room for the next class, even though the students do not have the skills to be successful at the next level yet. I think this is a very real problem especially in the poor, urban, minority schools across the nation. I am not really sure what to do but passing these students along only let us future classes know that they do not really have to do anything and they will be passed, just as it has always happened. If it were me I would try to get them interested in what artists like Kendrick Lamar, Tupac, Lupe Fiasco, and others write about in their songs. These artists talk a lot about social issues that are affecting the urban minorities and encourage people to learn about themselves and people.

highschoolteachers,"I use a cloze method, where students fill in specific blanks while the bulk of the information is already printed for them. It works well for English language learners and students with special needs, and to be honest, all of the other students enjoy the simplicity of it. It may sound a bit like spoon-feeding them, but in the end, they have ALL of the information you wanted to convey. Especially at the high school level, students have trouble discerning what is important or necessary to copy down. If you gave them something in a whole sentence, they write the entire thing, no matter how many times you say not to. If you highlighted the main idea / important words in the sentence, then deleted them from your original note set, and gave kids the version with the blanks... that is basically the cloze method. It also makes it acceptable for students to share notes with one another (think: if a kid is absent, how does s/he make up the day's work?). When you ask students to take their own notes, it seems unethical to have them share (a form of plagiarism), but with cloze notes, the information was given exactly like that to the class as a whole and kids can feel free to borrow/share notes and help one another after absences or while studying.",use close method student fill specific blank bulk information already printed work well english language learner student special need honest student enjoy simplicity may sound bit like spoon feeding end information wanted convey especially level student trouble discerning important necessary copy gave something whole sentence write entire thing matter many time say highlighted main idea important word sentence deleted original note set gave kid version blank basically close method also make acceptable student share note one another think kid absent make day work ask student take note seems unethical share form plagiarism close note information given exactly like class whole kid feel free borrow share note help one another absence studying
highschoolteachers,"At the start of each chapter, I write all the notes students need to know on the white board. I do block scheduling, so it usually takes at least 2-3 block periods to go over all of the notes--meaning I only have to write notes once every week or so. When I am done, I take a picture with my phone so that I can write them faster next semester/year. Once the students come in, I let them take notes how they like. Some meticulously copy down every word, others just listen to me and take notes based on what I say. Some do both. The majority, however, just sit and listen. When class is over, they walk up and take a picture with their phones. This method allows those students to engage and participate fully in my instruction, rather than splitting their attention between writing and listening. I have found a lot of students, especially those with ADD/ADHD, do much better on assessments using this method. They remember what we talked about because they were engaged, and they study the picture on their phone for the assessment. I tell my students to use whichever note-taking technique works best for them, and to adapt as the year progresses if they are not happy with their first few assessment scores. I believe this method prepares them for the freedom of college note-taking and provides some ownership over their learning. That key factor (ownership) is why I do not just print the notes out for them. They have to make a choice. It is worked wonderfully the last two years, and I plan to continue. I teach high school drama/oral communication, BTW, but I think anyone can use this method.

highschoolteachers,"I am on board with all of it except #2. Teaching responsibility is important; if the teacher is constantly picking up students' proverbial socks, then how do they learn any? Set your expectations (reasonable ones), indicate and demonstrate that you expect students to be working, but if a given student is consistently off-task or disengaged - and it is not for the reasons of a personal issue in their life or a learning disability - then I really do think that they need to learn to deal with the consequences, and yes, that means making it perfectly clear to a student that they are free to do nothing and will reap the consequences of that choice. It really is a valuable life lesson, and I have seen it turn around many students who were more accustomed to simply having teachers, admin, and parents cover for them. This is not the same as advocating the idea of not trying to engage the student, but if they refuse, then there are 30-ish other students who are in more need of one`s time. I teach only at the high school level. If you are always chasing students to put X away, or to stop doing Y, they will expect that to be the norm, and you will often have to do so - if not frequently, especially in more difficult schools. The rest of the advice is very good indeed. As a new(er) teacher, #1 really strikes me as the best. I was (and still am) concerned over having 'great' lessons, but reality is that as a newer teacher, you just do not have the resources nor expertise of someone who has taught a given subject/grade for many years. I honestly wish there were 'pre-made' unit/lesson plans for new teachers when they are given their first assignment - if they featured a good mix of tech integration, 'active' lessons, and useful tips, think of how much faster teachers would improve their craft, and how many fewer burnouts we would have.",board except teaching responsibility important teacher constantly picking student proverbial sock learn set expectation reasonable one indicate demonstrate expect student working given student consistently task disengaged reason personal issue life learning disability really think need learn deal consequence yes mean making perfectly clear student free nothing reap consequence choice really valuable life lesson seen turn around many student accustomed simply teacher admin parent cover advocating idea trying engage student refuse ish student need one time teach level always chasing student put i away stop expect norm often frequently especially difficult school rest advice good indeed new er teacher really strike best still concerned great lesson reality newer teacher resource expertise someone taught given subject grade many year honestly wish pre made unit lesson plan new teacher given first assignment featured good mix tech integration active lesson useful tip think much faster teacher would improve craft many fewer burnouts would

highschoolteachers,"I agree with John Dewey. The current refrain is to make kids college and career ready. To me this is the least desirable. Because it assumes that we have not been. But it also sets intent - to perpetuate the current system. And how is that working for us peasants? You could go with Jefferson who said education is to perpetuate democracy. Well that assumes democracy is the apex of human achievement. Dewey suggests education is for the child - for education sake. What does this practically mean? First, we cannot measure. Well, we cannot place arbitrary measures of learning as we do now. I should not have to force a thing. If you have observed your class, they seem to learn more from each other than us. Sure we set the subject, but they are fantastic at clarifying. We should just monitor and fill in gaps. We should also, just from our experience, set questions. Why is the YOU.S. so racially divided? Lower grades are tricky, but that is why I see value in not breaking kids out by age. Mix kids with ability with other kids who are temporarily unable. By high school you need content experts. Chemistry should be - let us blow shit up. Let us melt stuff. Physics should be, let us build robots. Math should be engineering. Writing program, building circuits. I often let my kids go with a question. I have 3/4 of the class working which allows me to focus on the 1/4 and really antagonize them into answering the question. Yes antagonize. What?

highschoolteachers,"Thank you for giving me some resources to use. I currently have their IEPs from last year as well as their IEP progress reports. I like to base my goals and objectives off of grade level standards. Unfortunately, and somewhat fortunately none of their goals are standards based but most have achieved mastery or adequate progress. Also kind of off putting is that reading through the ETR data and looking at past OAA scores- the goals are not necessarily based on that. For example: student scores below average in math fluency and computation but has no goal. Another student received a score near the mid 400s on their OAA (proficient is 400) and is average in reading on the WISC but has a reading comprehension goal. Another has a spelling goal but no one teaches spelling in high school and they mastered their last goal. My plan was to get a baseline for ninth grade skills (what I listed in the actual post) and develop their objectives/benchmarks off their present levels.

highschoolteachers,"Same here. I found my students were able to focus a lot more. Most teachers would not do this, either, saying it is disrespectful, but the key is managing it with respect on both sides. If you are respectful and have it put away while I am actively teaching, then who am I to say you cannot listen to music during work time? Students did put up a stink when I told them they had to take their tests without it. The (sound) logic given to me in high school was, ""I do not know what you have recorded on there and are listening to now - maybe you got hold of the test and have the answers.""

highschoolteachers,"I guess that depends on each individual teacher. I am a special education teacher so I obsessively track data and I do see large differences in my students' progress from the beginning of the year to the end.

Can I say that, decades later, I will have changed the course of their life? Of course not. Maybe for some, but definitely not for all. I am a small part of their entire school career. I do think that, if I just phoned it in and did the bare minimum, they would be worse off than they are now. That is enough for me. I see you teach secondary and I can tell you that the teachers that I remember from middle and high school as making a difference are the ones who challenged me to think of things from alternate world views and to form my own opinion on things that I probably would not have cared about otherwise. I also remember the teachers who assured me that there was a bigger word outside of my high school and small home town. None of that can be measured by data but I can tell you that it made a gigantic difference for me. I also never thought to thank them for the difference they made.

highschoolteachers,"Depends. Generally, my admin responds to things in a very heavy-handed way, which I often find to be disrespectful of the students. Example: students made a mess in one teacher's classroom during lunch (unsupervised), admin banned food from all classrooms, even with teacher permission. I turn a blind eye to non-messy snacks, and students clean up their messes in my room. If they do not, they get to come in during lunch and clean. I also sometimes pretend I do not see tardies if I know a student is coming from the other end of the school (we only have a 3-minute passing period). I also let students run to the bathroom if they need to as long add they check in with me before the tardy bell and come back within a couple minutes.

highschoolteachers,I ordered it because of your post. As a long term teacher in a Title I school what you have written makes a lot of sense. It has been my experience that teaching in these circumstances is all about relationships. I cannot convince my students why high school is worth it if they do not trust me and see that I understand where they are coming from. Unfortunately there is little in the way of training for this for teachers which is why I think we have such a high turnover rate. I hope this book can be a resource for this.

highschoolteachers,"1. Be honest and open about why you are there, so they understand and believe that you are invested, and will not abandon them. In my own case, I had a lot of privilege that ""bought"" me several second chances in high school; although I learned to teach at private schools, ""burning off"" that privilege is much more satisfying, and it is going to take a lifetime. I also have children who are currently younger than my students - so I have a personal stake in helping nurture a safe and successful world for THEM. Telling them these things - sharing my own story, in other words - has been a useful tool to help students trust me, and the environment I create. 2. Find and use metaphors and images they can understand which help you build buy-in - ideally through creating a sense of civic responsibility, to school, classroom, and universe. For example, I often point out to my students that their minds are a finite natural resource, like gasoline - something the world needs. When they do not show up, or tune out, I can then point out that the reason I might seem a little frustrated is that they are engaged in the equivalent of going to a gas station and paying to pump gas directly onto the ground - an environmentally toxic thing, and a waste of resources. When they succeed, I can say ""now we are cooking with gas!"", which is silly but rewarding. 3. Many of these kids know, deeply, that they are behind the rest of their peer groups outside the inner city walls. Be honest about their disadvantages - in the community, in their instability - and then show them how to ply those as strengths, and to build from there. Clarify, early and often, that they are NOT stupid, just disadvantaged and inexperienced. Point out that experience is what they are in the classroom to develop. Make the classroom SEEM valuable to them, in other words. Frame it well, from day 1. 4. Be as consistent as possible, and work HARD to maintain it throughout their time with you. These kids have less consistency in their world than any other cohort - they need to see it, and slowly grow to trust it, if you are to get anything at all out of them. 5. Most importantly: love and know the whole student. Practice respect and curiosity. Use questions, not commands. Never, ever, compete with them EXCEPT with humor. (Putting those last three together: I often say ""I get to model how to use a brain, though I am not perfect, I have had a lot more experience. So be careful - if you try to compete with me brain for brain, you will hardly ever win. This is NOT about me being smarter - I may NOT be smarter. I just have more experience with my own brain. My JOB is to help you gain that experience...and to learn how to keep using it and gathering it, beyond and after this classroom experience ends"").",honest open understand believe invested abandon case lot privilege bought several second chance although learned teach private school burning privilege much satisfying going take lifetime also child currently younger student personal stake helping nurture safe successful world telling thing sharing story word useful tool help student trust environment create find use metaphor image understand help build buy ideally creating sense civic responsibility classroom universe example often point student mind finite natural resource like gasoline something world need show tune point reason might seem little frustrated engaged equivalent going gas station paying pump gas directly onto ground environmentally toxic thing waste resource succeed say cooking gas silly rewarding many kid know deeply behind rest peer group outside inner city wall honest disadvantage community instability show ply strength build clarify early often stupid disadvantaged inexperienced point experience classroom develop make classroom seem valuable word frame well day consistent possible work hard maintain throughout time kid le consistency world cohort need see slowly grow trust get anything importantly love know whole student practice respect curiosity use question command never ever compete except humor putting last three together often say get model use brain though perfect lot experience careful try compete brain brain hardly ever win smarter may smarter experience brain job help gain experience learn keep using gathering beyond classroom experience end

I have actually been fortunate to have the author as a professor and mentor throughout my career. He is a former at-risk student who was raised on the streets in LA and who was involved in gangs from when he was young. One day, he decided to turn his life around, and he ended up becoming a professor and educational activist, trying to give voices to students like he was. A lot of the theories revolve around ways to form relationships and open routes of communication with (typically high school aged) students who have classically shut teachers out. He emphasizes making sure the students understand the idea of passion, so they realize the school system is a tool to help them do the things they want in life, rather than an extra burden they do not need in top of finding enough to eat, or protecting siblings from an abusive relationship.

highschoolteachers,"I can think of many sad ones; I have shared on reddit before about a former student who committed suicide (when I was teaching at a university) and how utterly blindsided I was (you are never prepared for that, ever), but when I moved to high school, there were more sad stories that you are not prepared for until it happens, for the first time, in front of you: what do you do when your student cannot turn in the homework because she is literally homeless and spends her time after school finding shelter with her mom; what do you do when your student cannot stay awake in class because there is no food at home, so whatever the cafeteria served for breakfast is all he is had in 24 hours. I worked at a low income school, so things happened a lot...lots of windows into harsh realities that break your heart. ...but instead, I want to share something funnier, something I look back on from the very first semester of teaching and still go, ""WTF?"" This is that icebreaker story you share with colleagues when they are like, ""Oh, I had a student throw up once in class!"" I had a chronic masturbator. **Story time:** I teach high school; my first semester student teaching, I had a student, a senior, in my class who was known around the school for doing one thing in particular...placing his hoody or sweater in his lap, reaching under his pants, and masturbating whenever a female student would get up to do a presentation. This happened in 9th grade. This happened in 10th grade. This happened in 11th grade. Why, after *multiple* offenses, the administration did not remove the student from the school, I do not know. As a student teacher, you walk into an established culture, and the culture of that school was ""do not question the administration."" As I have no kind words to say about the administration of the school where I student taught, this student was *my* problem, and no admin wanted to hear a peep out of me. Plus, to his credit, he had yet to whip it out in my class. Yet. As you might imagine, a student who does this type of behavior also might exhibit a host of other issues. This particular student was extremely antisocial (not in the clinical sense; I am not a licensed psychologist, and the layman definition is very different from the psychological profile) and, given his creepy behavior, no one wanted to be his friend. He would write compulsively, whether you were teaching or not, in all-capital letters in the scrawling handwriting one might expect to see written on a ransom note in a crumpled, black notebook that he always kept in front of him, positioned just-so. Now, at this particular school, I was told what to teach. In grad school, you learn a lot, but let me tell you: maybe I just missed the class on ""what to do if your male student likes to masturbate in class while his female classmates stand in the front of the room,"" but I am pretty sure I did not. We covered assessments, we covered diversity, we covered backwards planning, but hey, I do not know - maybe we just never got around to masturbation and its role in the curriculum. Well, one week I look down at what I am supposed to be teaching...and I shit you not, it is D.H. Lawrence's ""The Rocking Horse Winner."" For those of you unfamiliar with that short story, let me sum it up in brief: ***it is a thinly veiled allegory about a young man who discovers the joys of masturbation.*** And I, a petite female teacher, get to stand up in front of the class with the Chronic Masturabtor, and teach it. By the way, did I mention that he never spoke? Oh, I called on him, but he would not speak: he would only stare. And write. I mean, if you are sitting there right now, thinking, ""Wait, what? Go back to this short story,"" let me just pull a passage straight out of this to show you what I mean about 'thinly-veiled masturbation metaphor': &gt;He went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the clue to 'luck'. Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck. He wanted luck, he wanted it, he wanted it. When the two girls were playing dolls in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse, charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls peer at him uneasily. Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them. The little girls dared not speak to him. &gt;When he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into its lowered face. Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was wide and glassy-bright. &gt;""Now!"" he would silently command the snorting steed. ""Now take me to where there is luck! Now take me!"" &gt;And he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he had asked Uncle Oscar for. He knew the horse could take him to where there was luck, if only he forced it. So he would mount again and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there. &gt;""You will break your horse, Paul!"" said the nurse. &gt;""He is always riding like that! I wish he would leave off!"" said his elder sister Joan. By the way, the climax of the story is something straight out of *We Need to Talk About Kevin* - the mom walks in on the kid as he is furiously riding his rocking horse (...), and he looks at her and is able, to, uh...finish the ride. So, how to handle this situation? Had the kid masturbated yet - well, no, but he had done it *in every one of his English classes every high school year prior.* I felt like I had a timebomb on my hands. I also did not want to approach a teenage boy and discuss his masturbation habits with him for reasons related both to my desire not to jump off a bridge and the desire to not lose my license before I even had it. Plus, I did not want to make him self conscious - did he creep me out? Sure, but our students evoke *a lot* of emotions in us, and a big part of our job is to not them know that all of the time so that they do not feel ashamed. Although maybe you should feel slightly ashamed about masturbating in front of young women, according to the law. I am not a lawyer. So, before class started, when he came in (and sat down at his 'group' of desks, which can normally accommodate 5 students, alone, as usual), I said, ""Hey [student name], how are you?"" I am not sure if he replied, but I remember looking him dead-center in the eyes and saying as clearly as possible to convey my intended meaning, ""If you need to *go to the bathroom*, for *however long*, just raise your hand and let me know."" And do you think he raised his hand during that 90-minute lesson? ***HELL NO.*** Kiddo just sat there grinning like an absolute madman. He did not crack a smile all semester long, and there he was, ear to ear, like the fucking Joker, watching the goddamn world burn. But, an end to the story: later, I had to teach *1984* (which includes a rape fantasy and some other sex) and *Brave New World* *(which includes a drug-induced orgy). Both times his hand went up, and both times he was excused, sometimes uppwards of 30 minutes of class. I was not supposed to let more than one student out at a time, but I made an exception if he was the one in the bathroom, since I never knew how long he would take, and I was determined to avoid a masturbation incident, even at the cost of a reprimand from administration. I could tell when he was going to take a longer trip because he would say ""I need to use the bathroom"" instead of ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" Yes.

highschoolteachers,"I just heard this one yesterday and I will be using it next week on the second day of school with my high schoolers. You pass around a roll of toilet paper and tell the students to ""take what they need."" Some students will take like 10 squares, some will take 1 square. Then once everyone in the class has their toilet paper, however many squares they have is how many facts they have to say about themselves. I teach dance so the other activity I will be doing to learn everyone is names once we start dressing out is an add on name game. We go around the circle and each student comes up with a dance move for their name. We add on each dance move and name until we have a full dance and we repeat everyone is name with their dance move.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school in Australia, so Year 7 - Year 12 (ages 12-ish to 17/18-ish). The kid who got violent was a Year 11 kid (so around 16 years old). I told him three times to put his mobile phone away. He decided to pull out an apple and a knife and start carving slices off the apple, then stabbing said slices with the knife, then eating them off the knife while maintaining eye contact with me. I did not feel that this was an acceptable response to my perfectly reasonable request. Being aware of the class (a group of mostly Pacific Islander boys who I had taught for several years, who had not yet noticed what was going on) and fearing for their safety if any of them got involved, I started dialling the office from my pocket. Although I did not feel it was the best option (but I did not want to escalate the situation with the knife-wielding student) I stepped outside the room for about fifteen seconds, told the office to send admin to my classroom NOW because a student had a knife, then went back inside and kept teaching (again, because I was trying to keep the class from realising what was happening and not escalate the situation). All the while, with this student cutting away at the apple, glaring at me, and making larger flourishes with his knife every time he took another bite. A few minutes later, our principal arrived and told the student to hand over the knife. He did. She then escorted him from the room. Well, everything went wrong from there in terms of how my administration dealt with the incident. But I stuck to my guns, refused to accept the student back into the class, and kept at them until they suspended him (policy in my state is automatic two week suspension for a knife being brought to school - they sent him back to class the very next period, and I later found out that it was the second knife they would confiscated from him that week. So I dug my heels in and refused to budge until they gave him some kind of consequence for his actions). I probably could have handled the whole thing better, but I did the best I could under the circumstances - the amount of adrenaline pumping through my veins left me feeling like I needed to vomit, that day.",teach australia year year age ish ish kid got violent year kid around year old told three time put mobile phone away decided pull apple knife start carving slice apple stabbing said slice knife eating knife maintaining eye contact feel acceptable response perfectly reasonable request aware class group mostly pacific islander boy taught several year yet noticed going fearing safety got involved started dialling office pocket although feel best option want escalate situation knife wielding student stepped outside room fifteen second told office send admin classroom student knife went back inside kept teaching trying keep class realising happening escalate situation student cutting away apple glaring making larger flourish knife every time took another bite minute later principal arrived told student hand knife escorted room well everything went wrong term administration dealt incident stuck gun refused accept student back class kept suspended policy state automatic two week suspension knife brought sent back class next period later found second knife would confiscated week dug heel refused budge gave kind consequence action probably could handled whole thing better best could circumstance amount adrenaline pumping vein left feeling like needed vomit day

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school social studies. I have two things I do in the first two days. 1. I give students a beginning of the year survey. 10 questions like ""what is your favorite movie,"" ""what is your best friend's name,"" ""favorite teacher from last year,"" things like that. Then we go around the room and students pick one thing to share from their list and tell the class which superpower they wish they had. I save the questionnaires all year and have the students answer other questions throughout the year. On the last day of school I pass their question packets back and suggest they put them in their yearbook so in the future when they look through that year's yearbook they have a historical record of themselves for that year. Letting them pick which answer to share and which superpower they want helps bond students instantly I think. 2. The second thing I do is have students list everything they have done in the last 24 hours, then provide a piece of evidence that they completed that. So if they went to Subway for lunch, their receipt is their evidence. It has to be a hard piece of evidence. It is a fun activity that gets students talking with each other, trying to figure out what a piece of evidence would be for something like listening to One Direction. The evidence has to be something a historian could easily use. Both of these things are fun at any age and get students engaged with each other and the content of social studies.

I am judged by engineering and design of my systems as that is my work. If you do not believe in each student you failed. It is just not the job for you. What really pisses me off is the fact that I was one of those slacker kids in high school. The type of kid that teachers portrayed as the lazy student. I had two types of teachers the type that tried to fascinate me and make learning stimulating and the type that assigned 20 vocabulary words as a bullshit activity so they could take a break. If they do not want to study the vocabulary make it an engaging experience put the extra effort in with that kid. See kids are not lazy, they for the most part just lack that quick response stimulation they are used to receiving in modern society. Kids are confused and usually do not receive instant gratification from incremental learning but we know through longitudinal data and studies there is great benefits. So let us discuss some solutions to engage these students in a positive manor. I think the first thing would be to learn the etymology and history of the vocabulary words that is usually fascinating. Next move on to crosswords or a more exciting activity that would keep a kid like myself interested. They will learn faster and respect you. I am telling you this not as a teacher I am an Electrical Engineer, I design substations across the country my point in saying this is teachers gave up hope that I was going to achieve because frankly I just lacked some stimulation in the classroom to get those neurons flowing.

highschoolteachers,"I am a middle school physical science teacher with 12 years of experience. Let me give you some hints. Do not just do notes. Notes are boring. The first thing you should do is figure out how you want to break your class up into units. Measurement. Linear motion. Circular motion. Things like that. After you have decided what your first unit will be, decide what kinds of activities you want your students to do. If you are starting with something really simple like displacement and speed and simple linear motion, work out what you want to cover as notes and how you want to then implement that knowledge. Find some worksheets where they apply the formulas that you are teaching. Then, create (or borrow) hands on labs that the kids can use. I like to start with the big picture. *What are my over all topics?* Then, I look at the subtopics of those topics. *What exactly do the kids need to know about this?* Then, I look at how I can make them use the knowledge. *What is an activity that we can do?* Once you have gotten that out of the way, I suggest breaking your class period into manageable chunks. 5 minutes to go over last night's homework. 20 minutes of direct instruction/guided practice. 10 minutes of independent practice/go over that independent practice. 10 minutes to start on tonight's homework. Tomorrow there will be a lab. (Do not really have a lab every other day. You will drive yourself insane.) Work on one unit at a time. Spend the first week getting to know the kids and assessing their level of knowledge. Do not beat yourself up when things do not work. Heck, there are times when I say to my students, ""Okay, kids, I have never done this before. This whole thing could crash and burn. Let us see what happens."" They are usually pretty cool with that.

highschoolteachers,"I am a high school math teacher, so I do not offer much in the way of extra credit. I do give each student 3 'restroom passes' at the beginning of each quarter, and for any unused ones that they keep and return at the end of the quarter I give 2 extra credit points -- I feel this is justified as it rewards staying in my classroom and not needing to leave it -- if you can come into class every day and not have forgotten your materials, plan on using the restroom before/after my class, and are not going out to get a drink every day, I feel is justified for a small reward. The only other 'extra credit'esque thing I do is allow for test retakes within 2 weeks of a returned test. The caveat is that in order to retake a test, they need to (1) come in either after school or during lunch to look over their test and ask any questions about anything they missed (I pass back tests, let kids look at them for a few minutes, and collect them again -- when they come in to check their tests I make a judgment call on whether they can be left to their own devices in finding what they need to work on or if I should prompt a conversation and look into their thought processes more), and then (2) I do not take the higher grade, nor the average, but the second test grade. It is my belief (learning disabilities exempted) and has been fairly reliable that if you study, look at what you did not know the first time, and ask questions, the second test is ALWAYS the higher grade - the retakes are not any harder, just uses different numbers.

highschoolteachers,"To do list: * Room set-up (decor/posters, desk arrangement, tech ready to go, etc.) * Syllabus or course handout (introduction of class purpose, semester goals/objectives, attendance policy, classroom rules, materials needed, contact information, etc.) * Copies. (Syllabus, first day activity / icebreaker, week 1, and first unit if possible.) * Seating chart. With some classes/years, I let them sit where they like on the first day and make the seating chart based on who annoyed me. With other groups, I start with a seating chart to help smooth the first day. On the first day, I have the students make hanging file folders for crates at the back of my classroom where they will store their work (and receive back graded work) throughout the semester. Then, I go over my syllabus and make sure to point out anything that might be very different in my class compared to others. The students receive a lot of information on that first day (from 6+ teachers), so I try not to overwhelm them with anything that we could easily talk about later in the semester as it comes up. I take attendance and assure students I will learn their names or nicknames and how to pronounce them correctly. I explain my icebreaker and show my own example, and then I give the students time to work on theirs so they do not end up with homework. Then, I just float around and help out anyone who seems to be struggling and make sure the group does not get too loud. I have taught Composition (grade 11) for 8 years at a public high school with 58 minute classes, if that helps provide some context for the information here.

highschoolteachers,"My kind of motto is that I share positive things and I do not share things that high schoolers can use to begin to ask inappropriate questions. Questions about significant others and non-academic experiences in college are off-limits. Usually, my personal life will come through funny stories or when my Seniors want to learn about my life experiences because they are interested in learning about adulthood (that part of teaching Seniors is FUN!). There is something to be said too for the fact that there are a lot of things that I do not say to entire classes, but that I will tell students about when they come into my room at lunch or after school. I had a ""lunch crew"" during both lunches last school year, and so they usually heard more than my other students (however, I still did not talk about personal-personal issues).",kind motto share positive thing share thing schoolers use begin ask inappropriate question question significant others non academic experience college limit usually personal life come funny story senior want learn life experience interested learning adulthood part teaching senior fun something said fact lot thing say entire class tell student come room lunch lunch crew lunch last year usually heard student however still talk personal personal issue

highschoolteachers,"In my experience, once a student takes a ""break"" from school, they typically never come back to finish. It is definitely not a wise idea in general. I had a student who was in a band and he had multiple senior years because his attention was way too divided between school and music. (I would think that musical career refers to a band or something along those lines) I would encourage the student to finish high school first so he is not in a pickle if his musical career falls through. If the student is adamant about pursuing their career, encourage them to look at business or management courses at their local community college. It will help them out when their career takes off and it can serve as a safety net for that student. Our students are still teenagers, they do not have the best long term planning so they may not forsee failure. Whatever the case is, definitely encourage the student to pursue a path where he keeps many options open for himself. Not finishing high school is not necessarily that bad as long as they have alternate options for the future.",experience student take break typically never come back finish definitely wise idea general student band multiple senior year attention way divided music would think musical career refers band something along line would encourage student finish first pickle musical career fall student adamant pursuing career encourage look business management course local community college help career take serve safety net student student still teenager best long term planning may forsee failure whatever case definitely encourage student pursue path keep many option open finishing necessarily bad long alternate option future

Somehow, they figured out I was dating (either overheard me talking to another teacher or pieced it together from me not talking about a boyfriend or husband). They teased me relentlessly but were adorably good-natured about it. It was a writing class so every time we did a sample assignment on the board and they got to choose the topic, it would either be about a bad date or a euphemism for sex. Some of their creative writing pieces sent me on dates with Ronald McDonald and Andrew Lincoln from *The Walking Dead*. We made outlines for breakfast food that got entirely creepy based on their insistence that you must PROTECT your lap with a napkin before eating. I mean, truly, it was all so ridiculous but completely silly and harmless in the end. Not that every class would react that way and turn out so positive, but it sort of restored my faith in [teenage] humanity. When I taught middle school, I was already with my SO.

highschoolteachers,"Fellow Oregonian here, although I am working in California right now! Bad news, I am 90% sure that in Oregon, you must do a credential program through an accredited university.

I did my credential and MEd at PSU (my BA was in History), which was OK, but it general the programs are pretty much just hoops you have to jump through. If you do not want to do a credentialing program, stick with University teaching. I have not taught university, but from my experience, high school students are way below where I think they should be! If you want to be a high school teacher, the only way you can be successful is if you legitimately love and can deal with teenagers.

I like it because it is corny enough that it will not ruin anyone's day who is not being vocal about not wanting to watch a scary movie, but ridiculous enough that no one will get bored. I also like that it takes place on an actual planet, so there is something related to actual science in there. A better movie is Pitch Black, which is totally space related and scary, but in a totally fabricated world. There is also some very brief drug content (not at all glorifying it) and sexually suggestive language, but no sex scenes as far as I can recall. Despite the fake world, they do take advantage of it to do some cool stuff and you can use it to motivate a conversation about different solar systems. If you have not seen the movie, they basically crash land on what seems to be a desert planet that gets intense sunlight nonstop because of a binary star system or something. But there is a single period in the solar system's cycle that causes all light to be blocked off, and there are some very hungry light-phobic monsters underground..",ghost mar super cheesy john carpenter horror flick would say least appropriate like corny enough ruin anyone day vocal wanting watch scary movie ridiculous enough one get bored also like take place actual planet something related actual science better movie pitch black totally space related scary totally fabricated world also brief drug content glorifying sexually suggestive language sex scene far recall despite fake world take advantage cool stuff use motivate conversation different solar system seen movie basically crash land seems desert planet get intense sunlight nonstop binary star system something single period solar system cycle cause light blocked hungry light phobic monster underground

highschoolteachers,"&gt; When kids in these two similar datasets were asked **how much time they spent on math homework** each day, those in the NELS study said 37 minutes, whereas those in the ELS study said 60 minutes. All they are looking at is amount of time spent on homework vs. grades. This is one of the worst metrics to try and rate the effectiveness of homework I could possibly think of. Self reporting is notoriously inaccurate for starters. Second - you would expect your most highly performing students to complete the same assigned task more quickly. Trying to measure the effectiveness of homework as a teaching tool is like trying to measure the effectiveness of using PowerPoint during lessons. Are you using it primarily to organize graphics, links, and prompts in an interactive class discussion? Or are you dumping a wall of text on each slide and reading it verbatim to the class from your lectern? Ineffective teachers will assign mountains of busy work and it will be a tedious waste of time. That does not mean *homework* itself is evil. I am a high school Chemistry teacher. I believe that **well designed** homework assignments that tie into the overall instruction plan are a vital part of student success. To me well designed means: * No more than 10-15 min/night for the average student. Remember you are usually one of EIGHT teachers this kid has. * provides timely feedback (either checked/gone over at the start of class the next day, or given in some online and interactive system which provides right/wrong answer feedback in real time.) * provides the student an immediate benefit, such as having 1-2 questions copied from the homework onto the day's quiz. * typically begun during class, with 30-50% completed before they leave as I circulate and check for understanding.

highschoolteachers,"I was a sub for a year and a half. It is entirely up to you, but when I started subbing I made a list of subjects I felt comfortable *enough* subbing for. Most teachers assume that their sub may not have the total content knowledge that is needed to execute a master lesson. I am certified in 6-12 English and 6-8 Math. Based on my personal skills and abilities, I took sub jobs in any middle school subject except French and Woodshop/""Tech Ed"", and I accepted high school jobs in English, Social Studies, Performing Arts and Home Ec. Now that I am teaching full time, I design my lesson plans so that the sub gives an assignment and the kids work on it. As a sub, I never encountered a sub plan that actually asked me to execute a lesson; I do not ask my subs to pull off a full lesson plan. I subbed in areas I was comfortable in just so I could walk in knowing that I could *probably* answer questions during the lesson. But do not stress.

highschoolteachers,"Absolutely, 100% agree. My philosophy always has been to quench the thirst for knowledge, whatever it may be. I indulge valuable student questions in my high school history classes all the time. Just the other day, I was conducting a discussion of the differences among capitalism, socialism, and communism, and a student raised his hand and asked me if the ""cut open"" spaces on an [interrupted projection](http://i.imgur.com/L9D0Hl9.gif) of a world map that I had on my bulletin board were transversable by plane, or if you would have to go around them. I laughed, and explained the differences in map projections for about 2 minutes before moving on. I am never going to say no to answering an honest, intrinsically developed question.

highschoolteachers,"As a special educator and also someone who struggled in school with learning as a child, I can appreciate your situation. I really do hope you find some success for your child. But bear with me while I question critically some of what I read you saying. What makes you think what you describe qualifies as 'unprofessional conduct'? Or is it more that you mostly did not ""appreciate"" or like what she had to say? You might want to look into what the professional conduct requirements of a principal are exactly before making a such a serious accusation. Do not send email when you are feeling angry after a bad meeting. Give it some time and reflect first. (Also consider the potential fall-out since you work in the same board.) I understand that parents feel the need to advocate for their children and it can be a challenge to help them succeed in school. I know that parents feel the need to demand more, and the need to push until (ideally) the issues are solved. But know that educators care, and a school is typically is doing the best they can day to day to support all the different children. (As a teacher it can get pretty ridiculous when a third to almost half the students in the school all have IEPs with special individualized accommodations. It just is not realistic. ) That being said I have worked with some amazing students coping with severe dyslexia and dysgraphia. Their IEPS's provided accommodation because they needed speech recognition for writing and print to speech adaptive technologies in order to be successful in high school. In those cases the learning problems to resolve had nothing to do with the child's poor behavior choices. In our system, (which may be similar to yours) modifications mean the curriculum is delivered at a reduced level from the regular program. Its usually reserved for children at the lower percentile of intellectual capacity (which does not sound like your child). Accommodation is most often what is in an IEP for most children... double time for assessments, distraction free seating arrangements, adaptive learning technologies etc Also from what you have described, it sounds like your child can potentially be rather difficult at times? Perhaps that is the way things are, and it is not necessarily the fault of the teacher, principal or the school? Is not it entirely possible that some of his learning and behavior issues are also at times from poor choices on his part? Maybe that is part of where the principal is coming from? Maybe he does need to take on some of the responsibility for his choices as a student?",special educator also someone struggled learning child appreciate situation really hope find success child bear question critically read saying make think describe qualifies unprofessional conduct mostly appreciate like say might want look professional conduct requirement principal exactly making serious accusation send email feeling angry bad meeting give time reflect first also consider potential fall since work board understand parent feel need advocate child challenge help succeed know parent feel need demand need push ideally issue solved know educator care typically best day day support different child teacher get pretty ridiculous third almost half student reps special individualized accommodation realistic said worked amazing student coping severe dyslexia dysgraphia reps provided accommodation needed speech recognition writing print speech adaptive technology order successful case learning problem resolve nothing child poor behavior choice system may similar modification mean curriculum delivered reduced level regular program usually reserved child lower percentile intellectual capacity sound like child accommodation often pep child double time assessment distraction free seating arrangement adaptive learning technology etc also described sound like child potentially rather difficult time perhaps way thing necessarily fault teacher principal entirely possible learning behavior issue also time poor choice part maybe part principal coming maybe need take responsibility choice student

highschoolteachers,"I am a second-year teacher in a multi-grade classroom. Most of the students at our school are low achievers and/or cognitively impaired. We have two high school teachers who ""do not play nice"" with the rest of the staff, insomuch that they actually conspire and stir up drama within the tiny community to ""push"" out other staff members. (I wish I could say that it were actually as crazy as it sounds, but it is true; the rest of us are baffled about who any of this could truly benefit, including themselves.) Today, I put out a call for a set of eighth-grade textbooks that I needed for my eighth-graders since last year; the set I had was destroyed in a flood and the insurance claim never received, so I never had them replaced. It was almost just as well, since last year's students were about proficient with the 6th- and 7th-grade texts, and nobody would clarify for me just how I could get my hands on the grade-level stuff, anyway. My students this year are similar, but since somebody has finally told me how to put out a call, I did so, and the high school teachers caught wind; my entire lunch period, and a good fifteen minutes after school were spent listening to the high school teachers berate me for not having done this last year, especially with the students I had (admittedly some of the higher-ability kids in the school), and question my decision to even pursue getting the materials for the kids I have this year, who are ""idiots"".

highschoolteachers,"I got my MAT before going into teaching (I had a BA in History but needed the certification and figured that if I was taking the classes to get certified, I might as well get my Masters and be paid more). I lost count of the number of people who told me districts would not hire a new teacher with a Masters. Not sure how the rumor got started (perhaps some jaded people looking for a reason why they were not hired) but in my experience, the people who do the hiring (principles, department heads, etc.) have absolutely no interest in trying to save money by hiring someone with less experience. It does not even factor into the equation. The Board of Ed is responsible for coming up with a budget. Now, if it was a very small district, with low resources, I could see it possibly making a difference, but the majority of district budgets are in the millions. The extra 2 k that they pay a teacher with a Masters is a drop in the bucket. They spend more in an hour than the extra salary they would have to pay you. That being said, since you are already going to school for education (I am assuming that your program is a certification based program), you might be better off finding a job first and letting the district pay for your continuing education. Also, a new teacher in English has very few opportunities of landing a high school job (job saturation). You might have to teach middle school for a few years first. I am not saying it is impossible, more like improbable. If you have the right connection, you might very well end up in a high school.

highschoolteachers,"Hi, thanks very much for your input. The preparation that TFA provides is my biggest concern atm. I am fairly confident in my ability to prepare and teach a subject....but like someone else on here said, there is more to teaching than that. I answered your first Q in another reply: As far as being a new teacher goes, I am a non-traditional student right now, I will be 29 when I get my bachelor's. I had taken a few years off of studying to work, surprisingly, in academia (oh how I love the irony). Anyhow, I have several years of tutoring experience with elementary and middle school kids, and 2 years as an instructor w/ one of the big test-prep companies teaching LSAT and GMAT to college students and adults. It is some classroom management experience, although I know it is not the same as teaching, especially not in one of the poorer performing districts. And yes, ideally I would teach high school but I would not mind having a middle school classroom. As far as disadvantaged youths- I had a few as tutoring students, and I would say they struggled far more than their peers, even in basic language skills. It always took more work on my part to understand the particular motivation and needs of an underprivileged kid and they tended to require more support and guidance from me. So, it is tougher over all. I guess my question to you, then, is how do your TFA colleagues compare to your traditional-teacher colleagues when it comes to that first year in the classroom?

I was doing it because many of my other friends in the humanities were doing it, probably for the safety net reason. 3. These things made me doubt, and then I started googling TFA stories and that is what changed my mind. The horrible, morally and emotionally, situations these TFAers were writing about made me very, very anxious. I am now in an education program where I will have my license to teach high school English next December and then it will only take me 18 more credit hours after that for my master's. Also, I have a very good friend who did two internships with TFA before she actually became a TFA teacher, and she said she would not recommend it to anyone.

highschoolteachers,"Here is something better than advice: contact a local high school and volunteer your services as a guest speaker or substitute teach. No amount of advice is the same as actually being in a classroom with 25-30 kids.

highschoolteachers,"I am new to teaching too and one thing I have learnt is that there is nothing black and I white about it. It sounds like you are just struggling with your classroom Management and if you can get a handle on that you will be just fine. The kids need the structure and routine as much as you do. You seem to have supportive administration and that is a big benefit, you obviously are not comfortable with the idea of quitting so I would hang in there so you do not regret it. You may never go back of if you get out now. $1000 is low but if you worked full time it would more than double to my knowledge but then again, I do not know any teachers who got into teaching for the salary. Retail has more earning potential but brings it is own stresses and it is very competitive. My best advice would be to spend a lesson with your classes and work together to come up with a list of classroom expectations and consequences for each. Let the students participate so that they understand the process and the rules of your class. Do not be too strict. They know they can push you and will get away with it so anything you decide on Will require 100%follow through. Whatever you decide though, be clear and consistent. Also, in high school, be honest. Tell the kids that it is clearly not working for you or them and that you want to spend the lesson working out the best way forward. The next lesson, implement these rules, follow through with the consequences and get administration involved at the start if you need them so you feel like you have some weight behind your words and actions. Once the kids understand exactly what you want and what is and is not acceptable they will have no excuse to misbehave and if they do they will understand what the result will be. Without classroom managenent you cannot do anything in the classroom. It is undoubtedly the most difficult part of teaching because no matter how nice or good you might be, if you cannot get them to listen, you cannot get them to learn.

highschoolteachers,"I completely agree that your first priority needs to be your own health and sanity. You need to take care of yourself - and only you know what you can handle. That being said, when I was in 10th grade, my inner-city, poverty-stricken high school hired a new choir teacher, a short petite white woman who was homeschooled before college. She had the WORST first year ever, with wayyyyy too many students being incredibly disrespectful and just plain rude to her. But she managed to get through it. For some reason, she decided to come back the next year, and the year after that. By the end of her 3rd year, she was one of the most well-loved teachers in the school. So IF you do decide to stick things out (and again, DO NOT do that if your health is at risk), know that it will get better as time goes on. Also, if you do decide to stick things out, remember to make time in your schedule for YOU outside of teaching. Find people who can support you and remind you that you are a great person, regardless of how shitty of a day you are having.

Whether it be for behavior, attendance, or consistently turning in homework. The students want to know that they are working toward something other than staying out of trouble. This is why I have started carrying a goody bag filled with suckers, peppermints, jolly ranchers, and the likes. My high school students will monitor themselves as far as noise level and behavior. And I do not have to remind or ask them near as often to quiet down or consider their actions. They will tell each other to whisper or stop talking when they begin to get too loud. A lot of students will even add on that it is because they want the rewards that they know are coming at the end of class if they behave/ do not lose talking privileges as a class. (I have a three warning system. I allow talking, but the noise level must stay at a minimum. If I have to raise my voice to be heard, they are too loud. They get three warnings.

highschoolteachers,"I do not know what year you are in but when you are starting to look into colleges, find schools that have 5 year combined BA+MA(T) programs. Unless you specifically want to be an elementary school teacher, I advise against elementary education, and unless all you want to work with for the rest of your life is special ed (SPED) kids or move your way up to admin (not a bad deal) also avoid pigeonholing yourself into SPED. Teaching is becoming more and more competitive so your best bet is to always to be a star candidate with the proper certifications coming in and with a substantial educational background. There are counties that pay very well and produce top notch students and those require a masters for their teachers at a minimum. As mentioned elsewhere, your best bet is a major + teacher cert to get you started (can be done in 4 years). The major HAS to be a high school subject (such as english, biology, chemistry). Unless you minor in the subject you plan on teaching, it is actually difficult to meet the certification requirements outside of the major without having to take post-bac classes. I was told during a School of Education open house that the #1 reason why most people do not get the proper cert is that they do not have the proper coursework to even start certification in a specific subject. If you are interested in social studies, this is especially the case (no social studies major; history majors have to go back and take geography and other coursework to round out their education.) Work closely with an advisor to plan your career! Once you get certification as undergrad, it frees you up for what you can do for your masters. Most districts do not care what you do for your masters as long as you have one. The teacher cert masters are short enough, but you may be interested in other masters degrees other than teacher cert masters. If you choose to become an admin, you can get a MEd in educational administration, MEd in curiculum planning, MS in counseling (if you choose that instead), even a MBA if you decide to run a side business! Many of our teachers have full blown STEM and economy PhDs and just got certification tagged on via community college. This seems all overwhelming but once you get a hold of a career counselor (in your HS and in your future college) it becomes easy peasy. Contrary to popular belief, teaching is not dead end and there are so many options out there for teaching / teachers getting in and out of the field so always keep your eyes out for opportunities. If there is any advice to give: do not drop large sums of money for a teacher education, you will be sad. There are programs and scholarships that will pay for teacher education so there is little to no reason to be in 6 figure debt to become a teacher. Oh and do not pigeonhole yourself to your locale- anyone who is successful in life makes major sacrifices and push themselves far to make their life work. You may have to move to find a good position. In fact, if you like travel, I would highly suggest trying to teach overseas in your 20s and try to pursue international/embassy, and military schools before settling for your community school because that is when you have the most flexibility.

highschoolteachers,"It is always great to see more people wanting to join the ranks of us teachers. When making the decision about whether or not to go into teaching I think there are a few questions you must ask yourself 1. Where do you want to teach? (urban, rural, suburban, alternative?) This question could also be asked in many different ways. Do I want to work at a school like the one that I went to? Do I want to save the world through education? There are different cultures among the students and staff in all of the different types of schools. I have worked in only urban schools, but one was neighborhood and the other charter. I have had a couple of friends move from urban to rural and encountered a different world out there. This question is important because it helps to inform how you start your path towards certification. If you want to save the world through education alt-cert programs are fine. If you want to work at a school similar to your own background then alt-cert may work, but only if you are from an urban area. Normal teaching certification gives you more choice once you have your certification. 1. It appears that you are interested in an alt-cert program in Houston. Are you sure that the schools there will allow you to grow into the teacher that you want to be? I know this is an odd question to ask so let me add some context from my own personal story. I accepted a position in an alternative teaching certification program in Chicago. Once through the summer program I got a job at a high school, teaching physics, with a population of students who had very low skills. Many of my students only met the mathematical, reading, and science standards for someone 6 years younger than them. Therefore I had an infinite amount of remediation that I had to perform in my classes. I was constantly going over reading and mathematics skills. After two years there I came to terms with the fact that I just did not care to play catch up with my students skills. In order to be the teacher I wanted to be needed to move to a school where I could teach my content primarily. When I first started out I figured I was ""strong"" enough to work in these under-served areas for my entire career. Two years later I am still teaching, but at another school 1. What kind of teacher do you think you will be in terms of classroom management? Answering this question helps to inform where you should probably work. Personally I am a nice guy. This does not really work to well to progress a classroom full of ""urban youths."" So I needed to learn to become an asshole. My guess is that my niceness could be more easily accepted by moving to different schools, aka the burbs. In my third year of teaching I moved to a charter school with a very strict but well thought out and communicated discipline policy. The school-wide discipline policy helped me to become a much better teacher and actually focus on making my instruction the best it could be. 1. How comfortable communicating with parents do you anticipated you will be? I actually hate calling parents, because it usually does not change a student's behavior. Also I am required to have 7 successful parent contacts per week. This is a function of me working in the schools that I do. However I have heard that the parents at urban or highly successful schools can also be quite annoying and intrusive. Are you comfortable with either? I hope these questions help you to identify if teaching is right for your, or maybe they help you identify the next steps you should take. Beyond the questions, I suggest observing some classrooms. Try to observe in a neighborhood school urban, rural, and suburban just to see the differences. To do so just e-mail or call the principal of these schools stating that you are interested in teaching and that you would like to do some observations before going into it. Principals really do like showing off their schools even to people like you. Pay careful attention to the halls during passing periods, there is a lot to learn about the culture of the school by watching students as they move around. I did this, and really enjoyed it.

highschoolteachers,"That sounds terrible! I work in a county where teachers are clamoring to work here so much so many become subs as an intermediate before landing a full-time position. If anyone's asked to cover someone else's class, it is a sub giving up a free period (we are contracted to cover 6/7 periods). My so is school barely ever has a class left uncovered. I actually have a hard time finding jobs as a sub even though last year I was doing it full time (sans benefits) and this year I am doing it 3/5 days. I only get hired about ~4x a week last year factoring all the holidays and PD days. I actually have the luxury to pick and choose a little more because I do not have anyone to support and my SO makes enough so I do not have to pay rent or utilities. The only jobs I see having a hard time getting picked up are half day assignments and elementary school jobs. There are significantly more elementary school teachers than high school not to mention elementary school can be a major turn off to subs. It is a lot more work and less break time not to mention because children are so touchy feely adult men feel uncomfortable around small children.

highschoolteachers,"I am student teaching in a school that uses a lot of responsive classroom activities for morning meetings, etc. This was something we did a couple weeks ago in third grade, but I feel like it would be good through middle and high school too. Call two students to the front of the class. Student A has one minute to make Student B laugh. Student A can use jokes, make faces, and so on. Student A cannot touch Student B, so no tickling or anything. If Student A makes Student B laugh, B returns to their seat, and Student A gets another minute to make another classmate laugh. If Student B does not laugh, Student A sits down, and it is Student B's turn to make another student laugh.

highschoolteachers,"Oh my gosh this is mind blowing! **7.30** starts at high school?! **8** for elementary?! *(I would have struggled so much with high school starting that early!)* In NZ it is pretty much similar throughout the country (with exceptions here and there of course) Most high schools start at 8.30/9 and finish around 3/3.15 with 2 breaks - half an hour morning tea and between 40-50 minutes of lunch. These breaks are free for students to play sports, hang out etc. At primary and intermediate (our elementary and middle) most schools start at 9 and finish at 3. Again 2 breaks but most schools give 45minutes to an hour for lunch break. This usually starts with 10/15 minutes sit down eating at the start of lunch and then free time outside. (With teachers on duty of course.) Most schools have play grounds, fields, sports equipment etc. which students choose where/what to play. Most schools also have cultural group/music/dance/sport meetings at lunch for students to join at this time too. Lots of primary schools also have 10-20 minutes of fitness everyday (on top of 1+ PE lessons a week.) And if my class is getting a bit restless (or particular students) it is not a big deal to send them outside for a quick run around the field or something similar. Our ratings are pretty good internationally and we are a very multicultural society.",oh gosh mind blowing start would struggled much starting early no pretty much similar throughout country exception course school start finish around break half hour morning tea minute lunch break free student play sport hang etc primary intermediate school start finish break school give minute hour lunch break usually start minute sit eating start lunch free time outside teacher duty course school play ground field sport equipment etc student choose play school also cultural group music dance sport meeting lunch student join time lot primary school also minute fitness everyday top pe lesson week class getting bit restless particular student big deal send outside quick run around field something similar rating pretty good internationally multicultural society
highschoolteachers,"I am responding to your updated cover letter. Point 1: No contractions in formal letters like this, e.g. I have, do not, should not. Spell it out. Yes, it varies per district and person, but spelling out the entire contraction never got any eyebrow raises than someone who used a contraction. Point 2: Put your name and contact information in the header above the district's address, similar to how you have it in your resume. If not that (which I recommend), put your contact information (email, number) at the end. Make this process as easy for them as possible. Flipping pages is a pain when you are doing it 500 times. Point 3: (Trying not to offend the poster who said this but...) NO TO THE PHOTO SUGGESTION. Please, for the love of teaching, do not do this. It will make you stand out for all the wrong reasons. They can easily discriminate based off of appearance if you do this as well. It is the same reason why you do not include your age or birth date on a resume. Why can Dan Meyer get away with it? Because he is Dan Meyer. Point 4: No generic cover letters. Your revisions do not indicate that you have a spot where you are going to talk about the district or school's mission statement or beliefs. Do not send out the same cover letter to different schools. You can have a slot where you will change the wording; there is a high chance that most districts have similar statements anyway. I will be brutally honest: The issue with your cover letter is that it is all just a lot of fluff. You literally have not told me anything unique about yourself that sets you apart from others. This varies QUITE a bit with districts, but if I was reading a cover letter with a bunch of quotes and quasi-analyses of said quotes, I would be thinking, ""This person has absolutely nothing substantial to say."" If you feel the need to explicitly tell me how you feel and not what you did, you either do not have anything important to say (which obviously is not true based on your resume) or have no idea how to say it. I mean, you love working with kids? That is really nothing new. Every teacher you are up against does -- or will damn pretend it at the least. You are going to help students with technology? Well, duh. That is the way education is going. You HAVE to do that anyway. What TYPE of technology are you going to implement that will benefit the district and its students? &gt; Just like anything in life, a good support is needed in order to succeed. Education is one of the biggest building blocks to life. Students now no longer just understand the material but also get excited to learn. You told me nothing to make me believe that you are capable of doing this. If you tell me WHAT you did to make students feel excited to learn, then everything you said above is implied. Hell, you would not even NEED the above quote. I, your reader, would know by implication. &gt; Your cover letter needs to hook them so they hopefully look at your resume (and this is if you have made it past their online application filter process). Talking about what is already on your resume does not do this. I noticed you took out most of the information on your resume in your cover letter because of this comment, but you are misunderstanding what this poster meant. Your resume covers the basics of what you did to prepare yourself; your cover letter is used to expand on a particular set of incidents that will demonstrate to future employees why you are going to be a benefit. For example, my resume may state that I have worked in a middle school for x amount of years and helped pilot the 1-to-1 iPad implementation in my school, but my cover letter says that my students did a project in order to prepare them for the upcoming SBAC and state-wide tests that use iPads and computers. I told them that I was asked quite a bit to demonstrate iPad applications at staff meetings. I told them that having a teacher who is comfortable with iPads is beneficial because their students will need to be comfortable with technology anyway when they head to university or trade school or employment after high school. You need more concrete, real views and ideas in your cover letter. What you are saying you are going to do is much, much harder to prove. While you do not need to follow this formula, perhaps this will frame your thinking a bit more: * Par 1: The position you are interested in, a comment about the school's mission statement (I noticed with _____ that your district values ...) and why your experiences match those values. Pick one value or quality you have yourself (use of technology, etc.) and have that as your focal point to guide the rest of your letter. * Par 2-3: Preparation. What did you do to match this value the school holds highly? How is what you did going to actually benefit the school and its students whether presently or in the near future? * Par 4: A bit on your philosophy or what you see your students doing or what they are capable of (the answer to this is capable of anything so long as they have clear and high expectations). How will your teaching philosophy benefit your students and the world they will be living in? * Par 5: Wrap up. Repeat what position you are interested in and your contact information.",responding updated cover letter point contraction formal letter like e i spell yes varies per district person spelling entire contraction never got eyebrow raise someone used contraction point put name contact information header district address similar resume recommend put contact information email number end make process easy possible flipping page pain time point trying offend poster said photo suggestion please love teaching make stand wrong reason easily discriminate based appearance well reason include age birth date resume dan meyer get away dan meyer point generic cover letter revision indicate spot going talk district mission statement belief send cover letter different school slot change wording chance district similar statement anyway brutally honest issue cover letter lot fluff literally told anything unique set apart others varies quite bit district reading cover letter bunch quote quasi analysis said quote would thinking person absolutely nothing substantial say feel need explicitly tell feel either anything important say obviously true based resume idea say mean love working kid really nothing new every teacher damn pretend least going help student technology well duh way education going anyway type technology going implement benefit district student it like anything life good support needed order succeed education one biggest building block life student longer understand material also get excited learn told nothing make believe capable tell make student feel excited learn everything said implied hell would even need quote reader would know implication it cover letter need hook hopefully look resume made past online application filter process talking already resume noticed took information resume cover letter comment misunderstanding poster meant resume cover basic prepare cover letter used expand particular set incident demonstrate future employee going benefit example resume may state worked i amount year helped pilot ipad implementation cover letter say student project order prepare upcoming sac state wide test use ipads computer told asked quite bit demonstrate ipad application staff meeting told teacher comfortable ipads beneficial student need comfortable technology anyway head university trade employment need concrete real view idea cover letter saying going much much harder prove need follow formula perhaps frame thinking bit par position interested comment mission statement noticed district value experience match value pick one value quality use technology etc focal point guide rest letter par preparation match value hold highly going actually benefit student whether presently near future par bit philosophy see student capable answer capable anything long clear expectation teaching philosophy benefit student world living par wrap repeat position interested contact information
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school in Texas. Children who attend public school in Texas must have at least 7.5 hours of school each day. Some districts have slightly longer times, but that is not typical. The start and end times for each school are set by the individual districts, but generally have staggered times due to buses. My district has high school from 7:30-3:00, elementary from 8:00-3:30, and middle from 8:30-4:00. In Texas, teachers by law must have a minimum of 450 minutes of student-free planning time every 2 weeks, in blocks of no less than 45 minutes. We are also to have a 30-minute duty-free lunch daily.

highschoolteachers,"CC is NOT just standards....I have no real problem with the standards but I am going to copy past a past post of mine bc there are some good points about cc in it. I did my home work....and here are the key points: Standardized testing is changing due to Common Core standards. Thus the curriculum is being geared towed these tests. Colleges DO care about ACT and SAT scores. The experts seem to think that these standards will not prepare students for college. Employers may not care how you did on these standardized test but they do care if you graduated college with a particular degree. Meanwhile your students testing data and personal information will collected by private corporations who promise to keep it secure. Watch me justify my ""misinformation and ranting"" with total disregard to how I organize the content. 1. Ambassadorship: From the Department of Educations site, learn why the PAF program exists: principals should have meaningful opportunities to both contribute to and understand the [federal] policies to implement needed reforms, all stakeholders... must understand the intent of [federal] policy... PAFs will spend time gaining greater knowledge of the content of key federal programs and policies... Principal Ambassador Fellows (PAF) are hired.. to facilitate cooperation between the Federal Government and the non-Federal entity... So, a federal employee is going to take political policy and private corporation interests and use it to ""implement reform"" in public schools. However, I am sure they only care about maximizing your tax dollars and students education. 2. Sex ed standards: By the end of 2nd grade, students should be able to: Use proper names for body parts, including male and female anatomy. On page 14 it says: By the end of 5th grade, students should be able to: Describe male and female reproductive systems including body parts and their functions. Identify medically-accurate information about female and male reproductive anatomy. Define sexual orientation as the romantic attraction of an individual to someone of the same gender or a different gender. On page 9 under Guiding Values and Principles Instruction by qualified sexuality education teachers is essential for student achievement. Would Not that be the parents? Who decides who is qualified? Students need opportunities to engage in cooperative and active (lol funny word choise) learning strategies, and sufficient time must be allocated for students to practice (bow chia-wow wow) skills relating to sexuality education. What does that mean? I guess it dosnt really matter I am a fox news puppet and I clearly did not read the standards. Ohh wait, I am not a puppet and I just quoted the standards that are already being taught to some 7 year olds aka 2nd grade. And I just have to highlight this principle: Students need multiple opportunities and a variety of assessment strategies to determine their achievement of the sexuality education standards and performance. **3. Results of standardized: ** tests are used for high-stakes decisions, ranging from which schools to close to which students to hold back a grade to which teachers to fire. I hope little Timmy tests well today because his future and the futures of his teacher and administrators are counting on it. 4.The ACT: most widely known for the college admissions test of the same name, which is launching its Aspire testing system in the spring of 2014. Aspire will include a suite of yearly tests in English, math, reading, science, and writing in grades 3-10 that is being billed as linked to the ACT exam (and ACTs college-readiness standards) and aligned to the Common Core. I have already been discredited so who cares what I think right! Well the ACT publishers seem to think that standardized testing has an impact on future employment; probably because you cannot accomplish jack in academia if you cannot get into college. But what if you do..... 5.What the experts say about the standards themselfs: ""With the exception of a few standards in trigonometry, the math standards END after Algebra II, reported Stanford emeritus professor James Milgram (Milgram was also an official member of the Common Core validation committee.) Both Milgram and Stotsky refused to sign off on the academic quality of the national standards, and made public their explanation and criticism of the final version of Common Cores standards. At a March 2010 meeting of the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, Jason Zimba, a lead writer, told the board that the standards are not only not for STEM, they are also not for selective colleges. Stotsky explains: YOU.S. government data show that only one out of every 50 prospective STEM majors who begin their undergraduate math coursework at the precalculus level or lower will earn bachelors degrees in a STEM area. Moreover, students whose last high school mathematics course was Algebra II or lower have less than a 40 percent chance of earning any kind of four-year college degree. Dr. Stotsky also notes that there are other consequences to over 46 states having a college readiness test with low expectations. The YOU.S. Department of Educations competitive grant program, Race to the Top, required states to place students who have been admitted by their public colleges and universities into credit-bearing (non-remedial) mathematics (and English) courses if they have passed a Common Corebased college readiness test. Stotsky writes: Selective public colleges and universities will likely have to lower the level of their introductory math courses to avoid unacceptably high failure rates. Stotsky says, It is still astonishing that over 46 boards of education adopted Common Cores standardsusually at the recommendation of their commissioner of education and department of education staffwithout asking the faculty who teach mathematics and English at their own higher education institutions (and in their own high schools) to do an analysis of Common Cores definition of college readiness... Who could be better judges of college readiness? Well, I might not be an expert on the standards or how they will be reflected on standardized testing but Dr. Stotsky and Milgram are. Sooooo....it looks like the guy who did the math to get rockets to the moon and the lady who is the leading expert at language arts standards are on my side of the argument to some extent. 6. Data Dat Data In 2010, the National Center for Education Statistics released a technical brief about Guidance for Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS), which formulated a detailed plan for data stewardship in education. The SLDS created a grant program in 2005, each grant lasting three to five years at up to $20 million per grantee. In 2012, a combination of 24 states and territories struck a deal to implement data mining to receive grants. Personally Identifiable Information will be extracted from each student, which will include the following data: parents names, address, Social Security Number, date of birth, place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. On the other hand, according to the SLDS brief, Sensitive Information will also be extracted, which delves into the intimate details of students lives: Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or parent; Mental and psychological problems of the student or the students family; Sex behavior or attitudes; Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, and demeaning behavior; Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships; Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers; Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or the students parent; or Income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such program). It is unclear whether students will be required to answer the aforementioned questions while being analyzed by the four kinds of sensors promoted by the DOE report, but all students will be subjected to questioning. Although the SLDS claims that this particular information requires written parental consent before a minor is forced to disclose it, loopholes still exist that could circumvent parental authority. I am sure that this information will not be compromised or abused in any way because we all know ""that is not the purpose of standardized testing"". I hope this will encourage you to go educate yourselves on the topic of high stakes testing and the monopolization of public schools.",ca standard real problem standard going copy past past post mine

highschoolteachers,"There is backstabbing. It can be very political. You are but a number to them and not really a person in many cases. It is always about the bottom line and if they can save money by getting rid of you, they will. I have seen people lose their jobs at 55 years old and those people cannot get back on their feet because ageism is a real thing. 70 hour weeks are a common thing these days and so are two weeks of vacation where you are also expected to be hooked up to work the entire time. Then there is the reality of what you are doing that sets in. In my case it was yelling at teams of people for not having impossible projects done with unrealistic expectations. I just really got to the point where I could not be passionate about spreadsheets and I could not stand making other people miserable at the behest of management who had no clue how to actually perform the jobs of the people under them. Nepotism is a thing. Favoritism is a thing. Unfair treatment is a thing...and I have seen this across different companies. It exists everywhere. I am not saying that it does not happen in teaching too...but you are there for the kids at the end of the day.

Yesterday, while teaching about the early slave trade in the 700s, a student raised his hand and asked ""when are we going to learn about Morgan Freeman?"" I had to almost walk out of the room I was so dumbfounded haha. It can also be incredibly rewarding when you see students take an interest in a historical era or event.

highschoolteachers,"Sincere question, do you have experience teaching in these schools? Have you worked as a teacher in an under performing low ses school? Because I have and let me tell you, three years of full time classroom teacher in the lowest performing high school in my county made me realize the solutions are not easy and the situation can be damn near impossible. TFA is not perfect and it is commodifying teaching in the worst possible way, all brushed with the glossy paint of Ivy League prestige. I am not a fan. I have met Wendy Kopp and she is so out of touch in her ivory tower it is ridiculous. But this is not a one dimensional issue. &gt;Millions upon millions are being thrown at TFA by major corporations instead of being thrown to the schools that could hire veteran teachers and improve all aspects of their impoverished schools. Look let us be real. No veteran teacher is going to the hood. NONE. The teachers in these schools are young, idealistic, scrappy and willing to give their all for their job. They are first year teachers and take this job because all the cushy suburban ones are taken. They work and work until they bleed and burn out, then leave the profession all together. Veteran teachers 10 years from retirement are not going to move to a difficult teaching scenario no matter how good the pay is. Case in point, I had a colleague who got a $250,000 grant from the state to teach science for 5 years in a struggling high school because he had some of the best test scores in his other district. He was getting an extra $50k a year on top of his salary of $70k. All he has to do was stay here and survive, then move back to his original district. He quit after two years and forfeited his grant. He even paid it BACK. Why? Because the school killed his spirit, it absolutely destroyed him. He was smart, passionate, and very dedicated. He was an awesome teacher, I went to his PDs myself. Unfortunately he was wholly unprepared for this job for a number of reasons that was no reflection on his teaching skills or motivation. He told me he nearly got a divorce while working with us, which is no reflection on us or the kids but the sheer draining quality of being in this day in and day out. It is because teaching in the inner city is HARD. You cannot teach. You are so passionate and you want to do well and help these kids, but so many factors come into play. Social issues in the community, racial tension between teachers and students, the culture of schooling at large. It is little wonder people dedicate their lives to understanding and finding the answer, and no one has it yet. And I say bullshit to those who say ""just care, just love, just work."" Fuck that. I cannot name one person at my school who did not want the kids to succeed, from the principal down to the secretary. My school was a united team to build these students to success, and we still failed. It was not due to lack of talent, passion, effort or even support. It was because the infinite factors beyond our control overtook many of our efforts. I am not a TFA fan and I agree with you that too much money is given to TFA programs and veteran teachers are pushed out in pretty shading hiring dealings. However, money and financial incentives for teachers are not the answer. Community building, outside support and a solution against generational poverty is the first step to building a successful educational system, not administration support or teacher training. &gt;Ohhhh, so if they have the money to attract veteran teachers, but fail to do so, there is *one* thing to blame: administration. Teachers are up to the challenge. The one thing that tears a teacher down is lack of support from administration. Experienced teachers have seen and handled it all. The one thing they will not put up with forever is a bad supervisor (which is what a principal essentially is). You cannot handle hiking through Hell while hoisting the devil on your shoulders. Teachers are NOT up to the challenge. I am sick of this idealization of teacher motivation and the sainthood we all have to fit under. Look, teachers have lives, we need to do this long term. I lived in my classroom for three years and I gave my all to these kids. I can honestly say I did everything and I had a great principal on top of it all, I have no complaints on the support I received up top and I can honestly look back and not question an iota of my effort. Yet I still quit. I moved to a suburban district with more pay and less stress. I did it because I was having problems in my personal life that my dedication to teaching was creating, and I needed to make a decision. Because it is unrealistic for any human being to ask anyone else to give up work-life balance for the sake of a losing battle. Being in a hopeless situation, working tirelessly to keep from drowning while struggling every day not to lose the faith or your sense of direction is spiritually crippling. &gt;And they are only asked to serve 2 years, assuring they never become experienced, unlike a traditional teacher with proper training who started teaching that first year with the expectation of making teaching his or her career. No school needs or deserves temps, let alone our neediest schools. I went the traditional route, got my master's degree from an Ivy League university, published research on poverty in the Bronx with an acclaimed professor, had two years classroom experience when I decided to move into inner city and I got my ass handed to me my first year. I nearly died. Nothing can prepare you for this teaching scenario, nothing. It is really baptism by fire and very few teachers competent and educated with options survive for longer than five years. When I left after year 3, only four teachers at the school had been there longer than me. FOUR. Out of a staff of 40. The turn over was a travesty and so depressing, but I did not blame the teachers in the least. One teacher tried to commit suicide over winter break one year and her husband had to come in and quit for her. TFA will not do any better and their lack of preparation is a total sham for the kids going into it. But hell, I did horrible my first year, the only thing that sustained me was my sheer stubbornness. Inner city is not a joke. I loved my kids, miss them terribly and harbor so much guilt for leaving them. I had really great successes and horrible failures. I think about my quitting all the time and I do feel it was a personal failure on my part. Sorry for the long rant and I went off on crazy tangents that you will probably pick apart and negate, but I just want to say as someone who thinks Wendy Kopp has no idea what she is talking about and who thinks TFA is a flawed system, I give credit to the efforts they put into trying something, at the very least. Society is poison and educational systems are just a reflection of that. I do not think TFA is the solution but I hardly think it is the problem. I go through periods of being hyper critical and mildly disapproving of them since a lot of my friends went through it (TFA was big at my grad school), but at the end of the day our system is broken and some solution is needed. TFA is not poison, it is an imperfect promise packaged as a marketing scheme for the misinformed seduced by prestige. But I have met tons of passionate, smart and dedicated individuals that graduated from the program. I have also met idiots, but that is true for all jobs. **WAY TL;DR** Inner city teaching is hard, TFA will not prepare you but then again nothing will.

To my surprise, I have far more 3rd and 4th grade students as clients than any other grade because their parents see the extra steps and assume it is too difficult for the kids to learn, which really has not been the case. I have ended up teaching more to the parents than working with the kids in many sessions. To see what all the fuss was about, I worked through the math books they are using in class. The steps seem excessive but it amazed me how much my math skills improved. To have had those skills before I took my basic math, algebra, calculus classes in high school and discrete math, number theory, and linear equations classes in college would have eased my anxiety an immeasurable amount.

I have to say that when I was a student I respected a teacher who had some ""real world experience"" in their field of teaching. One thing I would suggest you look into is what I do; environmental education. It is often nontraditional style, where you actually take the students outside every day, every class, basically no matter the weather (kind of like a field biologist). You are teaching the same basic concepts oftentimes, but in a far more hands-on manner, which was absolutely amazing for me after working hard to become a field researcher in college.

In Standard, I give 0-30 minutes of homework weekly (planning for everu minute in the classroom to be utilized, so some kids do more at home if they miss time in class or do not focus and work or need additional time) and often there is time built into class to do homework if you stay on task 100% (this is the time built in to accommodate for the difficulty of squeezing every single minute, bell-to-bell out of Standard kids... it is really not easy to do this). Most of the time homework is just ""finish this thing"" or a small review activity.

highschoolteachers,"The point of homework is practice. That said, I do not think that practice necessarily needs to be done at home. I teach high school math at a school with block schedules, so each class period is pretty long. I typically devote half of each block to a guided lesson, and the other half to independent practice. I am always available to answer questions and such if students have issues with the practice. If a student does not finish their work for the day in class they are allowed to take it home, but that is never my intent when I am making the assignment. I prefer that a student be able to finish comfortably before the class ends. So far, I have found the strategy to work well. I teach in a title 1 school and have pass rates on the state test that are well above average, so I think my strategy is working fine.",point homework practice said think practice necessarily need done home teach math block schedule class period pretty long typically devote half block guided lesson half independent practice always available answer question student issue practice student finish work day class allowed take home never intent making assignment prefer student able finish comfortably class end far found strategy work well teach title pas rate state test well average think strategy working fine
highschoolteachers,"No problem. I see what you are saying, but I am going to offer a slightly different perspective. Feel free to take this all with a grain of salt because it is completely unsolicited. My undergrad is in physics, and I am working on certification. It looks like we may have a somewhat similar background there (The only difference is that I got to skip out on student teaching because I was hired straight out of college with no teaching credentials. My current full-time teaching job is counting for that in my state). Moving from a primarily upper-level university environment to high school was a major culture shock for me. The direction in which high school physics instruction is headed is drastically different from the way we learned it in high school and college. I spent SO MUCH TIME during my first year trying to make useful summary handouts and to emulate my college professors And I got horrendously frustrated. The vast majority of the time, they ended up lost, wadded up in the floor, or in the recycle bin, and the kids had not really absorbed enough for a summary to be useful anyway. We are a Google school, but even before then, my students--even the laziest ones--were and are much more inclined to check online than to keep up with paper anything. I post a brief summary of all of our plans for the week (like, really brief. Think: ""Discuss Types of Thermodynamic Processes"" or ""LAB: Finding the Speed of Sound in a Closed-Ended Air Column"" or ""Rotational Motion Problem Set #1 due Thursday) and all of the problem sets and examples that we plan to do for the entire chapter in advance, so if my kids miss a day (or just are not mentally present in class), they know what to look for. Solutions are posted after class. Anything beyond that point is on the student to come and discuss with me. Also, do not write off the text as completely horrendous just yet. Yes, the one I had my first year was the worst book I have ever seen in my life, but I had input into the adoption of a new one. Many of the evaluation copies from recent editions of certain texts are actually pretty impressive. I love the one I am currently using for general physics.

highschoolteachers,"I have heard that it is a lot easier to transfer from California out to other states because of all the stuff they make you do here. You might find [this](http://www.ctc.ca.gov/credentials/leaflets/cl560c.pdf) helpful. Basically, you will not be able to teach at a public school without a Single Subject credential. There is no Economics credential so I am guessing it would fall under Social Science (?). You will probably want to double check on that. You need to complete a student teaching placement and coursework to get your credential - along with other things like a basic skills test and subject test etc. I have heard that skills test can be transferred if your state has a similar one. After you are done with that, you are issued a preliminary credential which you have to clear within 5 years. That is done through a few more years of working with a mentor teacher, being observed etc. Basically student teaching again but you will have your own classroom. So getting a credential in CA is pretty difficult which is why it is hard to transfer it in. But I would also call a county office of education and talk to their credential department because they might be able to clarify what hoops you can skip over if you are trying to transfer a certificate. For private schools, you may not need a credential. A lot of them prefer one but it is not required by law and I know some around here need teachers and will hire - especially if you studied that particular area during college. Also, I am pretty sure economics is required in California high school for one semester. It might be hard finding a job if you are *only* willing to teach economics.

I am going to tell you something, as a substitute who has worked in some ghetto-ass places, their opinions of your performance do not fucking matter.

Lastly, if you are credential program is anything like mine was then they are probably teaching you that any failure in your students is your fault. It is not. Some kids are fuck-ups and will remain fuck-ups until they change their attitudes. You cannot change their attitudes with more ""universal design for learning"" or ""meeting your students at their level"" so you should not feel responsible for that. Remember, that the professors in your credential program have a job to do and in many cases that is push fluffy bunnies shit and conformity.

highschoolteachers,"I had a kid start cursing me out today because I would not let him leave the room and just go wherever (I am actually surprised he did not walk out, but I think he is in danger of getting kicked off his team and was hoping to avoid a worse referral? I did not write him up yet because I want to talk to him tomorrow, as the behavior was erratic and seemed triggered by something and I want the full story first -- there will be *a* consequence but what consequence, I have to talk to him to see). I addressed the fact that he could not leave, instructed him on the behavior I expected and the consequences, and then moved on and kept teaching ignoring the rest of his rant. It is things like this that really make the kids think you are serious about teaching, I feel -- I am not going to waste 24 other kids time to get into a rant with a teenager. It just does not even factor in. The key is to never take anything personally but still issue consequences and take everything seriously. The distinction between ""seriously"" and ""personally"" is simple: Is it about the work? I am very serious about the work. Everything serves the work, including me. The work of learning is what we are here for. My own personal feelings are pretty irrelevant to that. I was in teacher mode, so the kid cursing me out honestly did not even factor in on a personal level. It was all about assessing how I could best move on with the class. How did I get that way? I do not know. More than half a decade of Title 1 middle school probably did not hurt -- you get numb to being cursed out after awhile, I guess? When I have to make an actual ""mad voice"" (because it is all some kids respond to, honestly), I have to pretend usually. I just do not get angry feelings from what the kids do 99% of the time.

Special needs students? How is curriculum different from when you were a kid? What about the school day, is there an equal number or hours devoted to ELA? What about critical thinking?

highschoolteachers,"umm.... occasionally. I do a pretty good job of connecting the ""content"" with real life. My philosophy on learning history in high school is that students need to learn the skills necessary to become effective citizens. We do not study history in order to learn a bunch of dead white guys' names and dates. We learn it in order to make sense of our own world, to understand how the systems and institutions that affect our lives developed and, perhaps most importantly, how to change them for the better. I like to tell my kids that it does not matter what the founding fathers wanted; instead, it is up to us, as the people of the YOU.S., to ""establish a more perfect union"" that is representative of our needs, wants and dreams. But in order to effect change, we must understand the foundations and traditions that we have developed in our society. Therefore, I always try to show how something from the past is analogous today. This is pretty easy to do in YOU.S. History as we are always rehashing the same issues. (We are currently talking about the Great Depression and the New Deal - the role of government in stimulating the economy is as important in the 1930s as it is today.)

Honestly, can you do both? Having more than one licensure can be super beneficial in that you are open to a wider range of possibilities and can switch between them if the opportunity comes up. Districts like it too. You may find that once you start your training you much prefer one path or age group over another, it is not uncommon for teachers to switch their plans as a result of a field experience!

The district can overload classes, but they have to pay more each time. Eventually it gets cheaper to hire another teacher, which is the point.

They have to use that money, plus whatever they get from federal and state sources, to cover all the bills. The superintendent and business manager create the budget, which is approved by a locally elected board of directors. The principals have a building budget, which includes the money for each teacher in the building.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;I am currently undergoing training to become a secondary science teacher and right now we are discussing state standards and how they apply to curriculum development. (In general, I get the impression of ""create curriculum and find a way to align it later."") That is the opposite of what standards and standards-based teaching should do. I hate when teachers just make stuff they like and say how it fits (I teach English, and this is a real problem in both English and Elementary school IME with both because a lot of teachers want to do ""fun projects"" with little real value or just read the stories/texts they like because they always have or whatever). I am a big fan of standards-based teaching. Not ""kill and drill"" testing or anything, but the actual concept of teaching from a framework of meaningful standards, rather than just shoehorning what you think goes and pretending it aligns later. &gt;One of the points the teacher made is that all of her students are expected to meet the same criteria despite a vast age difference (anywhere from 5-7 years old), and the standards are not developmentally appropriate. Are you talking about the Core specifically? People say this, but for the most part, the standards are developmentally reasonable for the lowest age of students in a grade (this gets iffier when you consider how middle and high schools force the on-target kids to accelerate math and is a little iffy in 3rd/4th grade math as well, but it is not unreasonable accept the acceleration issues which are unrelated to CCSS). The ELA standards are developmentally reasonable throughout. I taught Kindergarten overseas and wanted to teach it in America until I observed classes. Kindergarten teachers do not teach rigorously enough here, by far, for me. This has probably gotten better with Core? (This was awhile ago. I am happily settled in high school now.) At least I hope it has gotten better. Too much circle time, construction paper stuff with no purpose (I love project based learning, but only when it starts with the standards), friends time, etc, and it did not really feel like a workplace to me. I think a lot of people do not realize what 5-7 year olds can do if you push them. They should go observe classrooms in more countries to see just how much small children can do in many places where they are trusted to engage intelligently. This is why we fall behind. Obviously, students need differentiation, but it is not necessarily just an age thing. One student may be ESE and need to be identified (especially in the primary grades -- they do not have help/skills yet or even a diagnosis usually). Another student may struggle with particular subject matter. Different students will develop different cognitive and even motor skills at different times, as they mature (no 2 children are the same). Some students are ESOL and need help with language. Some students are having rougher times emotionally. Some students came with more vocabulary and their parents spoke to them more, so they know more words. That is not about age though. Making it into ""A 5 year old cannot do X"" is done far too often. The problem is the resources the teachers are given are often not up to the task (or the teacher does not understand how to differentiate and scaffold), not that the tasks are not appropriate for the kids. Things like 40 kids in a room, a kid who throws chairs but admin never deals with him, parents who do not answer the phone, a lack of planning time and materials, etc, are all big problems. But a lot of teachers fall back on what is easier because of it, and that is not a real societal solution. &gt;For those of you who teach in high school, do you still see differences among age groups? Or have students pretty much evened out by that point? Does that teacher have a mixed grade level class? I am wondering why would 7 year olds be in Kinder routinely or 5 year olds in 2nd? I would not expect that gap to start showing up until kids are old enough to be held back (usually after primary for sure). In HS, I have that kind of gap -- for example, I have a 10th grade Standard class with 11th grade repeaters in it too that has kids ranging 15-18, but it is still a 10th grade class. The ages do not matter much (older means further behind, of course, and those kids usually need more support, as they have already failed the class at least once).",it currently undergoing training become secondary science teacher right discussing state standard apply curriculum development general get impression create curriculum find way align later opposite standard standard based teaching hate teacher make stuff like say fit teach english real problem english ime lot teacher want fun project little real value read story text like always whatever big fan standard based teaching kill drill testing anything actual concept teaching framework meaningful standard rather shoehorning think go pretending aligns later it one point teacher made student expected meet criterion despite vast age difference anywhere year old standard developmentally appropriate talking core specifically people say part standard developmentally reasonable lowest age student grade get offer consider school force target kid accelerate math little iffy red the grade math well unreasonable accept acceleration issue unrelated ca ela standard developmentally reasonable throughout taught kindergarten overseas wanted teach america observed class kindergarten teacher teach rigorously enough far probably gotten better core awhile ago happily settled least hope gotten better much circle time construction paper stuff purpose love project based learning start standard friend time etc really feel like workplace think lot people realize year old push go observe classroom country see much small child many place trusted engage intelligently fall behind obviously student need differentiation necessarily age thing one student may ese need identified especially primary grade help skill yet even diagnosis usually another student may struggle particular subject matter different student develop different cognitive even motor skill different time mature child student sol need help language student rougher time emotionally student came vocabulary parent spoke know word age though making year old cannot i done far often problem resource teacher given often task teacher understand differentiate scaffold task appropriate kid thing like kid room kid throw chair admin never deal parent answer phone lack planning time material etc big problem lot teacher fall back easier real societal solution it teach still see difference among age group student pretty much evened point teacher mixed grade level class wondering would year old kinder routinely year old and would expect gap start showing kid old enough held back usually primary sure i kind gap example the grade standard class the grade repeater kid ranging still the grade class age matter much older mean behind course kid usually need support already failed class least

They had divided students into cohorts, and I happened to have all of the cohorts of the high achieving kids.

Most of my work was graded on whether students put any effort into it, so the kids who thought my class was useless (like their parents were instilling in them), did not put any effort into considerate annotations for their readings or putting together projects that were all about them.

highschoolteachers,"I always worry about my students who are doing well and then they seem to falter. Now I do not teach high school, so I do not see as many students as a high school teacher sees, so I first try to find out from the student if there is something going on outside of school that is affecting their performance. There usually is because I teach elementary. It amazes me that parents do not think that what happens at home does not effect school. I like if they tell me because then I can support the student in quiet ways. Now as a high school student in AP class who admits they are having trouble studying, it is on you. If you need extra help go talk to your teacher. I know my own children did AP classes and their teachers always worried about their progress. The teachers hosted extra study sessions, so if they failed it was not on the teacher. You had to be motivated to take AP and doing well on the tests pays off. One of my own was a sophomore in college after one quarter because of his AP classes. They gave him a great foundation. That saved us a lot of money.

highschoolteachers,"My district has an extremely detailed ""Student Code of Conduct"" I could not possibly get into every infraction, but it is what you would expect. At the school level, we have our own skipping policy, tardy policy, etc, and they work OK. I do not think you can ever really make a 100% effective skipping/tardy policy for high school students that keeps them from being late or skipping, but we do alright. I feel like my school is very simple compared to a lot of other places with their fancy systems: * If a kid sells drugs, has sex on campus more than once (they get enrolled in a strict counseling program and put on a NO PASS list the first time), threatens or hits a staff member, brings weapons, makes deadly threats against other students (any threats against staff vs. serious threats against students)... it is pretty much automatic expulsion and things work out fine. Repeated theft, fighting, possession (they get enrolled in an addiction program the first time and put on a strict NO PASS list and agree to be searched daily) and documented bullying all get expulsions as well. My administration is pretty good at the paperwork, and the kids that should not be here get tossed to the alternative system, as they should, where there are more restrictions and the structure suits their needs better to keep all students safe. * Less serious things like electronics violations, classroom disruption (repeated), cursing out teachers, skipping/tardies, etc, are all handled with In School Suspension (which is a joke, but that is not anyone's fault per se) and Administrative Detentions. The deans do a good job at trying to assign the kids the punishment they would hate the most, but your repeat offenders in ISS make up like ~1-5% of our population and are what they are. There is not a magic bullet. Removing them from classes so a) they cannot ""get lost"" midday because they are stuck in 1 room ALL day and b) they cannot disrupt or corrupt other kids is about the best anyone can do. I understand that. Admin tries to reach out to parents, find kids mentors, work with the kids, figure them out, etc, to their credit. But the free will is with the kid, and the kid has to want to change. My school has a lot of counseling programs and psychologists who come in as well, to deal with the stress of adolescence and mental health problems. We also have a Physician's Assistant and a Nurse Practitioner who can and do write prescriptions and treat medical issues FOR FREE. These two things help immensely and is something every school in the country should have. * Suspensions are mostly for fighting or other extreme behaviors that will eventually lead to expulsion if repeated or for kids awaiting expulsion hearings. My school is not a big fan of OSS and prefers to use ISS to make the kids at least come to school and be monitored. As to the teacher experience, they expect a fair amount of documentation from us. Some people are bothered by that, but I am not. We live in a litigious society. And if they are building a case for expulsion especially, there is a lot of paperwork the district/school board requires. Teachers have to do their bit. For smaller offenses, like issuing a tardy detention, we just have forms in triplicate and it is extremely easy. But when developing a case for why a kid needs a different class or setting, we have a lot of paperwork and documentation to do. There are no ""rewards"" at my school for doing what you are supposed to do (some class rewards, vary by teacher -- I do not really give any, but I do give kids privileges at various times, based on behaviors: i.e. you can go to the RR when needed as long as you always come back quickly/come to class on time/do your work, but that gets taken away if you are on my LIST; you can listen to music while doing X work, but only if you are not trying to sneakily text/do something on your phone, you did not have your phone out at an inappropriate time previously, you are not behind on your work, AND the work is appearing on your screen, etc -- I do not consider these rewards but the natural result of the students building trust or mistrust and getting treated appropriately by me, as their manager). However, more recently, there is a positive behavior system for attendance (being to classes, on time, on a regular basis) because we have had a lot of absence issues lately, in addition to the normal skipping/tardies. They do small celebrations with snacks for the kids who have been in school or only had ""excused absences"" every day for the quarter and enter kids in raffles. It is nice and seems effective for 9th and 10th graders, though upperclassmen do not care (but it is new, so the current 10th graders might like it more as they age still, etc). For the most part, though, my admin agrees with me that a school discipline system is about rules and consequences, not some kind of carrot-style rewards. Kids are expected to do what they should be doing. Teachers are not really questioned unless they deserve to be (i.e. you have discipline issues in every class and even with kids who never bother anyone else, and then they observe you and it is clear you are unreasonable). Admin takes our sides against parents and students regularly when we have proper documentation and are reasonable. Demographics: My school is the #1 ranked HS in the district, but not the richest. We are in a wealthy area, so people think our kids are rich but we are 35% free and reduced lunch (vs. many schools in the area which are less than 10%) and a lot of people do not know that. We have a very diverse population. However, we have a lot of super rich kids and they (their parents massive donations) and the fact that our local community is so proud of the school are a big reason my school has all the services and options we do.",district extremely detailed student code conduct could possibly get every infraction would expect level skipping policy tardy policy etc work ok think ever really make effective skipping tardy policy student keep late skipping alright feel like simple compared lot place fancy system kid sell drug sex campus get enrolled strict counseling program put pas list first time threatens hit staff member brings weapon make deadly threat student threat staff i serious threat student pretty much automatic expulsion thing work fine repeated theft fighting possession get enrolled addiction program first time put strict pas list agree searched daily documented bullying get expulsion well administration pretty good paperwork kid get tossed alternative system restriction structure suit need better keep student safe le serious thing like electronics violation classroom disruption repeated cursing teacher skipping tardies etc handled suspension joke anyone fault per se administrative detention dean good job trying assign kid punishment would hate repeat offender i make like population magic bullet removing class cannot get lost midday stuck room day i cannot disrupt corrupt kid best anyone understand admin try reach parent find kid mentor work kid figure etc credit free kid kid want change lot counseling program psychologist come well deal stress adolescence mental health problem also physician assistant nurse practitioner write prescription treat medical issue free two thing help immensely something every country suspension mostly fighting extreme behavior eventually lead expulsion repeated kid awaiting expulsion hearing big fan os prefers use i make kid least come monitored teacher experience expect fair amount documentation u people bothered live litigious society building case expulsion especially lot paperwork district board requires teacher bit smaller offense like issuing tardy detention form triplicate extremely easy developing case kid need different class setting lot paperwork documentation reward supposed class reward vary teacher really give give kid privilege various time based behavior e go or needed long always come back quickly come class time work get taken away list listen music i work trying sneakily text something phone phone inappropriate time previously behind work work appearing screen etc consider reward natural result student building trust mistrust getting treated appropriately manager however recently positive behavior system attendance class time regular basis lot absence issue lately addition normal skipping tardies small celebration snack kid excused absence every day quarter enter kid raffle nice seems effective the the grader though upperclassmen care new current the grader might like age still etc part though admin agrees discipline system rule consequence kind carrot style reward kid expected teacher really questioned unless deserve e discipline issue every class even kid never bother anyone else observe clear unreasonable admin take side parent student regularly proper documentation reasonable demographic ranked i district richest wealthy area people think kid rich free reduced lunch i many school area le lot people know diverse population however lot super rich kid parent massive donation fact local community proud big reason service option

It is important to note what jobs look for in the ever changing world. Now technology skills and teamwork skills are important and we incorporate that into our lessons. However I do not think I should know or care what jobs are available at any given moment. Not all students want to go to college, not all students want to be a business major just because Amazon has an opening.

highschoolteachers,"They lost me at the rant about standardized testing. If it is done poorly or too often it is a problem. And in many places that has happened. However, people forget why standardized testing came about in the first place. Teaching quality varied drastically from one school to the next. Students were graduating that were borderline illiterate or could not work simple math problems. Teachers in a given subject could teach whatever they wanted, however they wanted, without consequence. That is how I ended up spending 2 weeks in middle school making a collection of pressed leaves for my science teacher. Standardized testing provides an objective metric by which to judge student progress between teachers and schools. When done well it is actually highly effective, such as AP courses offered in high school.

I am a first year high school science and my admin has been positive all year.

When he brought it up to me, I realized that yea, I had been doing that and was able to pretty quickly discern why I would developed the habit. In the majority of my classes, when a girl at a table would ask a question, I had a maybe 50/50 chance the boys would pay attention to the answer, which of course often ended up with them asking the same question 5 minutes later. If a boy asked a question, the girls were generally right there paying attention without any prompting. So I would started, almost unconsciously, preemptively redirecting the boys but not the girls. Apparently the girls who would noticed actually thought it was funny and had started having the guys at the table ask questions so they could laugh at it, rather than being offended by it. However, needless to say, I have tried to correct this habit and I try to answer questions either much more ""individually"" or include the whole group on a much less ""gender-specific"" basis.",sure exactly thinking question first thing came mind first year science admin positive year closest thing criticism received year principal alerting would heard grapevine girl class apparently picked slightly bias one girl group asked question would sure include boy conversation vice versa brought realized yea able pretty quickly discern would developed habit majority class girl table would ask question maybe chance boy would pay attention answer course often ended asking question minute later boy asked question girl generally right paying attention without prompting would started almost unconsciously preemptively redirecting boy girl apparently girl would noticed actually thought funny started guy table ask question could laugh rather offended however needle say tried correct habit try answer question either much individually include whole group much le gender specific basis

And if it is a luxury right now, you cannot just say that it is a reflection of the education system. You must be fair and say it is a reflection of the education system AND a capitalist society that has allowed inequality to fester."" Certain people are not at an appropriate developmental stage to read Hamlet when they are 17 years old and truly appreciate its meaning. Every week we have English teachers on here complaining that half of their students are not motivated to read the assignments, and even as a science teacher I am privy to the fact over half of the regular students in even middle class suburbs are spark noting the assigned readings instead of actually analyzing the source material. They see no purpose behind the act. What is actually being accomplished by quizzing and testing students who would be better served pursuing their machines in the trades? I have numerous students who should not be taking physics but are excellent at reconstructing a car engine (which requires a different skill set of applied physics). I devoured classics like Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky in my early 20s, but I went through the motions in high school. ""I am the socialist I probably sound like, but I firmly believe that education should not be subjected to market forces (like school choice and all that) because there are winners and losers in every market, like the top comment in this thread suggests."" Let us not conjure up utopian alternatives. History reveals that there are winners and losers in all systems, but in the free market you at least get the luxury of choice, and competition promotes meritocracy to a much better degree than any other system attempted thus far. The alternative to school choice turns everyone into an educational serf except the upper middle class and rich. Vouchers also negate the concern about the poor being locked out of education because the public still subsidizes their children. In Texas, for example, families that make less than $70,000 will get an additional $1,000 if the pending legislation is passed. Yes, free markets are amoral, which is precisely why they cannot be socially engineered by a small class of authoritarians. You do not have idiots like Rick Perry in control of a million students.

I do not know if you are in a position to go to bat for this kid -- are you new? how much of a rabble-rouser could you safely be? if you did, would your style be direct, like a conversation with admin, or indirect, like wearing your own pink shirt? Stuff to consider. A related story: I went to a rural high school, and it was big news in my freshman year when a boy a few grades ahead (a friend of a friend, also a class clown type) came to school wearing a skirt one day, just because he felt like it. He refused to change, arguing that the skirt was long enough to meet the dress code and there was nothing in the school policy barring him from wearing it, and they issued him a one-day suspension. A few of his friends came to school with tutus over their pants to support him the day he was suspended (their tutus were confiscated), and once his suspension was served he walked into school the next day wearing a *different* skirt, only to be kicked out yet again. I do not remember exactly how it all played out (I know at one point he was required to come to the office before going to class to make sure he was dressed appropriately, which he did, then halfway through the day met his sister and switched his pants for her skirt in the bathroom), but his parents mostly stayed out of it (they were big hippie types that I think were encouraging him to ""fight the power"" on his own). The whole ""controversy"" made the school newspaper and I am pretty sure the discussion escalated, maybe to the next school board meeting? In any event, he ultimately won the right to wear a skirt, although I do not remember if that was thanks to admin conceding to his points or just giving up. The interesting thing was that even though my school was very rural and very homphobic, because he was a good student and a well-liked (albeit silly) kid, it felt like almost all the students and many of the teachers were on board with his because at the time. In any case, I felt like it was a good example of somebody standing up for their rights and actually giving a shit about something, which I personally would love to see more often out of my students.

highschoolteachers,"I was teaching English medical terms to prospective young nurses (16-18yrs) in an Asian country and we were reviewing how to ask an English-speaking patient where it hurts. Things were going fine until we came to the genital area. I gave them the technical terms (penis, vagina, buttocks) and one of the girls asked about a slang word she would heard, ""cock."" I explained that in English there are a lot of slang terms for those areas. My co-teacher excitedly asked me to give as complete a list of terms as I could, so the nursing students would be informed. Fifteen minutes later, already bright red from embarrassment, I was then asked to come up with a song to help them remember these terms as I typically did for organs and illnesses. I spent the next excruciating hour or so shakily singing an exhaustive list of below the belt terms to the tune of ABCs with a group of 45 utterly tickled pink high school girls, who proceeded to skip away from class in pairs singing ""penis, cock and tool and dick, johnson, wang, wiener and prick"".",teaching english medical term prospective young nurse yr asian country reviewing ask english speaking patient hurt thing going fine came genital area gave technical term penis vagina buttock one girl asked slang word would heard cock explained english lot slang term area co teacher excitedly asked give complete list term could nursing student would informed fifteen minute later already bright red embarrassment asked come song help remember term typically organ illness spent next excruciating hour shakily singing exhaustive list belt term tune abc group utterly tickled pink girl proceeded skip away class pair singing penis cock tool dick johnson wang wiener prick

If the only thing you are willing to teach in terms of age group and subject is high school Social Studies, and you do not want to spend time in middle school or doing English, then you may have a hard time getting the position you want. Plus, in California, Social Studies is fairly broadly defined: history, ancient to modern, world and US, psychology, geography, civics, economics and ethnic studies. With high school social studies, you have no guarantee that you will not get a subject that you are not very familiar with. When I did my student teaching, I almost got economics, which I really did not want. LAUSD has passed something recently to push towards ethnic studies mandatory for high school graduation. If you eventually want to teach college, think really carefully about whether you want to do academia and research - because AFAIK that is what will determine if a four year school will hire you. Are you doing cutting edge research and writing grants and making them money? And if the answer is no, you just want to teach older students, Social Sciences at junior colleges are filled with PhDs who did not make it in academia.

When I needed everyone is attention, I started with a gentle, gradually quieting shush and slow arm movements, like a conductor of an orchestra letting the last note fade. It did not work. So I channeled my inner drum major(guy who leads a marching band, who I was my senior year of high school) and used a militaristic-sounding ""EYES FRONT!"" It was effective in quieting the class, but the sudden sharpness of the shout, which is part of its effectiveness, scared some students at the front of the class, and even startles my mentor teacher. Looking back at recordings of my teaching, it sounded uncomfortable when I was not saying it, but listening to myself. Later in the semester, my mentor teacher gave out cards to the students giving me some feedback while I was absent: Something I do well, and something I should improve on. Nobody said this to my face, but ""EYES FRONT"" was really poorly received. They HATED it. Near the end of student-teaching, I stopped it, and for the time being, used ""your attention up here, please."" It worked fine, but I want to try something else when I have my own classroom.

Perhaps my experience would have been better had I been teaching outside of Chicago. Now, I teach in MD and my pay is really great... COL is higher here, but we are frugal so the biggest adjustment has been housing.

highschoolteachers,"""Confrontational"" is the wrong word. Taking a kid's bait is not what you want to do - teachers who get into shouting matches with their kids have lost. You do have to confront bad behavior, but it can be pretty simple and mellow - call a student to your desk when everyone else is busy, or right when the bell rings.

He broke down and started sobbing right at my desk, during class. Totally took me by surprise. Turns out his behavior was so out of whack in junior high that he had to sign a behavior contract to be allowed into high school that said he would be out on his ass if he ever got out of line. He thought my write up was going to get him expelled.

highschoolteachers,"I had a student who I taught as a senior but knew as an athlete on the team I coached. He transferred from a different district where he was classified as special Ed, severely handicapped. He was nowhere close, he was mildly dyslexic. Once he was reassessed in our district (in 9th grade) he began to thrive. This is around the point where I met him. I was lucky enough to have him as a student his senior year. I liked having a nice student in my class and I know that he respected me as his coach. He would often stay 2-3 minutes after class to ask how I was doing, or vacation plans etc. I always had the impression that this kid really cared and thought it was valuable for him to chat for a few minutes. During one of these chats I asked him what his future plans were for after high school. He replied "" I am just going to go into the military"". I said ""You are JUST going to do that? Are you even aware of WHY you want to?"" He gave a standard statement about the benefits, and AFTER it is all over he will have a good standard of living. I told him those were all good reasons, but did he really research military life? or was he just settling for something that is not too bad. He felt that he was too academically inferior to go through community college and transfer to a university and that the military was the only remaining option. A few weeks later an announcement came through our school about a $10,000 scholarship for students who are interested in earning a vocational certificate from a regional community college. The following week, during our after class chats, I sat him down and explained the scholarship, we looked at he local community college and looked at some of the course options. There was an informational meeting on campus the following week and I said I thought he should go to discover other options. I told him that it was ultimately up to him to make a decision, but if he wanted help I would be there to help him. The following week the student returns from the meeting.

The pay schedules cam vary, so I cannot really comment on anything other than the fact that you should negotiate the highest salary you can, because all pay raises will be based on your starting pay. Many higher ed jobs like this are not unionized, so some of the stability of a collective bargaining agreement might not exist. My college has shared senate governance, but I have no representation and the president, on behalf of the board of trustees, can veto almost anything. This makes it imperative that you feel out the culture. In my case, I get paid less, but I have a great supervisor, and the job is much easier and less exhausting than teaching. When I leave to go home, I do not bring any work with me. It is its own set of opportunites, especially if you like higher ed, however, I do look back on K-12 teaching with rose colored nostalgia. Seeing as you have had toxic work experiences and that you can spot red flags, feel out the college to see if it is a good fit. If it looks kosher, then apply and see what happens. Because you would potentially work with brand new college students straight out of high school, your K-12 background can really be marketed as a strength in helping those students succeed and to help maintain retention.",nice change pace depending college job vary many way university might someone type disability smaller college might two three people total handle everything student support finance invoice pay schedule cam vary cannot really comment anything fact negotiate highest salary pay raise based starting pay many higher ed job like unionized stability collective bargaining agreement might exist college shared senate governance representation president behalf board trustee veto almost anything make imperative feel culture case get paid le great supervisor job much easier le exhausting teaching leave go home bring work set opportunities especially like higher ed however look back i teaching rose colored nostalgia seeing toxic work experience spot red flag feel college see good fit look kosher apply see happens would potentially work brand new college student straight i background really marketed strength helping student succeed help maintain retention

highschoolteachers,"Hi. I need to put a disclaimer that I am not a teacher yet-- I am going into my fourth year. I attended a few CSET workshops at my CSU school recently, so I am knee deep in this stuff. What you heard about the situation on the ground with lack of job postings at the secondary level is true, at least from hearsay. Both friends and faculty have attested to it. The fact really is that English &amp; Social Science jobs are the hottest jobs to get in K-12. I will say, however, that you cannot think about things like that. I am not necessarily a person that believes in fate... But you never know when a job posting will open up for you, and you will be the right person for it. That said, going the multiple subject route is probably the way to go. You have to pass an exam called the RICA which is supposedly a beast. It is heavy on linguistics content. And of course, the CSETs. I have since learned that with a multiple subject credential, one can teach at the middle school level, provided you took a 'block' i.e. English and Social Science. And finally, if you still want the high school English job, then all you have to do is pass the English CSET (heh, easier said then done) and go back to school once more for a single methods course to add on. No additional internship needed if you already have one credential. I have a friend right now is pursuing a high school credential (decided elementary was not for him), and he explained that his methods course was a cake walk, and had he had to do the internship in the high school subject, it would have so much more difficult. This is heavily anecdotal--I cannot substantiate it myself--but from rumblings like those, it seems that single subject internships are tougher than elementary ones. Again, this is probably heavily situational. Every credential program is different and hard asses can be found anywhere.",hi need put disclaimer teacher yet going fourth year attended set workshop csu recently knee deep stuff heard situation ground lack job posting secondary level true least hearsay friend faculty attested fact really english amp social science job hottest job get i say however cannot think thing like necessarily person belief fate never know job posting open right person said going multiple subject route probably way go pas exam called rica supposedly beast heavy linguistics content course sets since learned multiple subject credential one teach level provided took block e english social science finally still want english job pas english set heh easier said done go back single method course add additional internship needed already one credential friend right pursuing credential decided explained method course cake walk internship subject would much difficult heavily anecdotal cannot substantiate rumbling like seems single subject internship tougher one probably heavily situational every credential program different hard ass found anywhere

highschoolteachers,"My class is mostly reading instruction, essay composition, and a small amount of research and grammar; I use literature as a means to those ends, not as the end in itself. I think building reading stamina with rich, authentic texts is really important in the middle grades, rather than just learning to master the easy answers and short lessons found in basal readers. I would also like to see a stronger focus on grammar and punctuation during middle school than what currently occurs in my district, along with a higher standard for proper letter formation in handwriting. Its really, really hard to get a 14-18-year-old to stop putting random capital letters in their writing, or to stop drawing lowercase Bs like plus signs, or to put full spaces between their words, or to remember to use apostrophes for possessives, if they have not been held accountable for those things in a long time (if ever) - they want to argue that these things do not matter, because their prior teachers, and teachers in other subjects areas, do not prioritize it. I think its easier to teach good habits when they are younger than it is to un-teach bad ones in high school. But most of my ninth graders come in with little skill in all of these areas, and we work through it regardless. I know MS/JH teachers are doing the best they can, just like the rest of us.

highschoolteachers,"I teach at a rural middle school and I agree with your comments about marks for mediocrity. My honors 8th graders were pissed when they did not get full points on their essays simply because they did one. When we practiced revision, they said it was perfect, did not make changes that were suggested and turned in final drafts with edit marks on their essays. This happened for both students who used Google Classroom and those who chose to hand write it. This lead me to teach a mini unit on editing. Things like capitalization and punctuation are still issues with my students. I just wish I could get my 8th graders to try. Many of them are still concrete but the helplessness and apathy with the knowledge they will go on to high school and middle school grades do not matter is frustrating at times.

highschoolteachers,"I had an aha moment recently at a training with other teachers from my school. We were practicing grading student writing samples according to a very specific rubric, and I gave something a C that many other teachers felt was worthy of an A. (C was the correct answer, BTW.) One of them was disgruntled and said, Id like to see you all write a better essay than this! My mind was blown. I had never before realized what the end result would be of allowing teacher candidates to slide through college without learning how to read and write critically, but in that moment, it was so obvious why my students always struggled and dragged their feet when it came time to revise and improve their mediocre essays - it was because most of the adults they knew gave them full marks for mediocrity, and did not see any need to improve upon the first draft. Its a cycle - the teachers accepted that level of work because they themselves got away with that level of work in high school, and it just continues on through the generations.

With the exception of swimming (if your school has a pool) students are not required to change clothes because the unfortunate truth is many of them struggle enough for clothes.

highschoolteachers,"I think you should continue with the degree/program. You mentioned that you will be getting your certification in May if all goes well, and that means you will have graduated with a degree. I feel like it is a waste of money to drop it all now because you are hesitating.. Here is what I can tell you about teaching/my advice for you moving forward: 1) yes, there are long hours, however depending on the grade level, content, and people you work with (teachers willing to share lessons or help out in any way), this can be a lot less time consuming than you would expect. There are also a TON of resources out there on the interwebs so you can definitely find useful places to help you out. (Check out the Reddit subs for starters.. also, I know we all hate that they require accounts for viewing pictures, but Pinterest actually has a lot of useful lessons on their site so maybe make an account and browse through there; teachers pay teachers is also useful). 2) depending on where you want to teach (private/public school), I can almost guarantee you do not have to create a formal lesson plan for every lesson in the real world of teaching. I only lesson plan formally when I am being observed and they require one. So yeah, I get that you hate lesson planning, most people do lol, just suck it up for this last semester - think of it as one of the things you just need to do get your degree. 3) working with kids is going to be great, it is one of the most motivating factors for most teachers (including myself), but remember that they are not going to be perfect angels and even if you have that wonderful, perfect, lesson plan it is not going to go the way you want it to, so expect that when you are going into the full time internship next semester. 4) if you are not sure of other careers you want to get into as opposed to teaching, it can serve as a good buffer for you while you figure it out.. you will probably teach the same grade again in the years to come (and that is really the benefit of staying in the profession in the long run - you become familiar with the content and ways to teach it so it will require less time to prepare and consciously think about each thing you teach). However if you want to figure out something else for your career, you can have a full time job, decent pay upon graduation, long breaks to research for your next job/fill out applications/etc and still enjoy some time you get with the kids while teaching. I want to leave you with this: yeah, if you look at it short sighted it is just a job, and maybe if you are slacking one day it is not a big deal, I mean the kids will still learn something right?!and truly, to not burn out that first year, there may be one of those ""watch a video and answer some questions"" days for your own sanity, that is okay. However in the grand scheme of things, do not tell yourself that you are absolutely going to refuse putting in any extra time to plan for the kids before you have even gotten the job - you may find that the relationship you have with the kids makes you enjoy coming up with new plans and figuring out what to teach. Plus, you cannot go into work not prepared, it is not like a regular 9-5 job where often (not always), if you screw up, it is on you and hey the worst that can happen is you get fired. Here, you have a class full of kids and if you are not prepared they are either going to are your life miserable (lack of classroom management/lack of activities to do/etc) or you will drive yourself crazy. TLDR; Do not quit when you are just about about to graduate with a degree for something you can use at least as a backup/filler career till you find what you really want to do in life. Also, go to work prepared (that does not mean you need to spend 50+ hours to prepare). Source: 2nd year of being a full time high school teacher.

highschoolteachers,"Hey that is my area! Early intervention is ESSENTIAL for student success if the student is struggling. The biggest thing I like about RTI models is that it stresses continual changes to groupings - if Student A is really having a hard time with oral fluency, then that student is put into my fluency group and for several weeks that is ALL we do. Student A can then test out. An effective RTI model can really help more students because the groupings can change every few weeks. You have to be careful with RTI though because it stresses a magic pill way of thinking - If I can just fix Student Bs informational text comprehension then everything will be okay again! Reading is not like that, there is many processes occurring at the same time to lead to understanding and you cannot isolate one and expect it to be the magic solution. I teach at a 5, 6, 7 middle school and we have five reading teachers in our school, of which I am one. When we were doing our initial round of assessments and data combing and grouping, it was very clear that A LOT of students needed our help, but due to limits of our schedules and not enough people, some kids who could really use a semester of reading intervention do not qualify.

highschoolteachers,"That is part of the equation and yes, it is done in many places. For example, I grew up in New Jersey where there was a court case called ABBOTT V. BURKE which stipulated that funding to low income districts needed to be supplemented by state and federal monies so that it would be nearly equal (it also limited class sizes and added a tech component in later years). I am sure there are similar regulations in other states. Here is the issue. Fair is not always equal. While this decision makes funding to low income and high income schools equal, it does not take into account the increased needs of students in low income districts. Things like a higher proportion of IEP/ESOL students, physiological issues caused by living in poverty, achievement gap (which starts before they even enter school and grows with age), food access/security, feeling of safety and security in the home and in the community, family drug use/abuse, undiagnosed ADD/ADHD, less access to medical treatment/dentist/eye doctor, and increased school security are all issues faced mainly by low income schools. All of the aforementioned issues cost money. My suburban high school had ONE ""security officer"" in the building (just a retired cop who sat in the lunch room all day). The school I currently work for has a team of 10 security guards, and we only have a 25% FARMS rate and are located in a pretty wealthy community. Security teams in rough school would be even bigger. Add all the costs for the other issues faced by low income students and you can see how quickly the extra money would be eaten up. What you would really need to make things fair would be to divert *more* funding to high needs schools and cut the budgets in the high income schools. This would help address the myriad issues that I mentioned before. However, there is not the political will to do that because the people making that decision would have to put the needs of high poverty schools in front of high income schools (and their parents).",part equation yes done many place example grew new jersey court case called abbott i burke stipulated funding low income district needed supplemented state federal monies would nearly equal also limited class size added tech component later year sure similar regulation state issue fair always equal decision make funding low income income school equal take account increased need student low income district thing like higher proportion pep sol student physiological issue caused living poverty achievement gap start even enter grows age food access security feeling safety security home community family drug use abuse undiagnosed add adhd le access medical treatment dentist eye doctor increased security issue faced mainly low income school aforementioned issue cost money suburban one security officer building retired cop sat lunch room day currently work team security guard farm rate located pretty wealthy community security team rough would even bigger add cost issue faced low income student see quickly extra money would eaten would really need make thing fair would divert funding need school cut budget income school would help address myriad issue mentioned however political people making decision would put need poverty school front income school parent

So it will make finding a job easier, but you are likely to be a SPED teacher. If you do not want to teach SPED, do not do it.

Edit: that being said, I do have a SS endorsment and am working on my Sped endorsment, but I want to teach sped, not ss. I just realized a bit late. Actually, you might be better off getting a Language Arts/Social Studies cert, especially if you want to do middle school.

highschoolteachers,"Administration at ALL levels (school, district, state, and federal) need to nix social promotion for good. Instead of social promotion, we need serious tiered support for our struggling students and, in upper grades, tracked paths for students who continue to not show an interest in advancing their academic studies and would rather study a trade/vocational discipline. In my district, students can be held back twice: once in elementary school, and once in middle school. Not in high school. I teach the inaugural year at my middle school and most of the kids come in as complete messes. While a little bit of transitional struggle is expected, I was stunned to find out that out of my 105 kids, 20 were socially promoted--and I am sure these numbers are much higher in other areas. Social promotion does nothing to help these students. By the time they come to me, they already assume that they are going to be passed on forever. In high school, several of them drop out or just barely pass 12th grade and then have extreme difficulty finding work. It is ridiculous. Stopping this ludicrous policy of social promotion and instead implementing real supports/pathways for our students would be an excellent start to give ALL students the education that they deserve.",administration level district state federal need nix social promotion good instead social promotion need serious tiered support struggling student upper grade tracked path student continue show interest advancing academic study would rather study trade vocational discipline district student held back twice teach inaugural year kid come complete mess little bit transitional struggle expected stunned find kid socially promoted sure number much higher area social promotion nothing help student time come already assume going passed forever several drop barely pas the grade extreme difficulty finding work ridiculous stopping ludicrous policy social promotion instead implementing real support pathway student would excellent start give student education deserve

highschoolteachers,"100% this. There is no accountability for academic performance pre-high school. I can have one fourth grader who can do algebra and another who tells me that 5-5=5 (because there is two fives, and two fives is 10, and then you take away 5) and they both get passed to fifth grade without a second thought. Our district holds summer school over their heads, but there is no follow through. I firmly believe that if we started requiring 3rd graders to pass the state test, it would at least start to fix some things. It would be a nightmare at first to manage, but it would be a wake up call to those who are completely capable but just not motivated to put forth the effort or maybe just need some extra time to grasp the material. People say that holding students back harms self-esteem, but I think it is way more damaging to keep pushing kids ahead when they are not ready because they will just continue to feel stupid.",accountability academic performance pre one fourth grader algebra another tell two five two five take away get passed fifth grade without second thought district hold summer head follow firmly believe started requiring red grader pas state test would least start fix thing would nightmare first manage would wake call completely capable motivated put forth effort maybe need extra time grasp material people say holding student back harm self esteem think way damaging keep pushing kid ahead ready continue feel stupid

highschoolteachers,"The biggest problem with education is that we are still using a model from the 1800s, BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER. That is why we still have up to 34 kids to 1 teacher in most classrooms. Because it is CHEAP. That is also why most teachers are female. If more men were in the profession they would demand higher pay and fewer hours of work at home. (They have already demanded that by not being the in profession and choosing more lucrative professions that provide them with more down-time after work and more camaraderie with colleagues.) How to fix this? Maybe all schools starting in 1st grade should have class periods with specialists? The kids go from room to room, switching every hour or two. Two hours for LA, 90 minutes for math, 90 minutes for science, 150 minutes spread through the week for music and art, and 2 hours a week on social studies and history. (I am shorting SS and history only because there is not enough hours in the week.) Why would this work? Because teachers would no longer have to prep for 5 or 6 subjects in the day. They would just have to worry about one. They could become experts. HOWEVER, this also means we need smaller class sizes. 20 max, in K-12. WHY? Because for all but high-income families, being a kid in America today is HARD. 1 out of every 4 or 5 kids lives in poverty with all the insecurity and mayhem that brings. I think it is about 50% that are being raised in single parent households now. Kids lives SUCK in many ways these days. The system designed in the 1800s was built on small-town life, two parent families with one parent home most of the day to handle emergencies. Plus, in the 1800s, basic RESPECT of adults was taught at home. Those teachings, or respecting your place in the pecking order of a school, flew out the window starting in the 1980s. NO ONE respects teachers anymore, and respecting teachers is not taught in many homes. So if the kids are not learning social skills and respect at home, that teaching duty falls to the schools. Elementary teachers spend hours and hours every year teaching little kids how to function in society. That is the MAIN reason classes should never be more than 20 - so kids can be a part of a large family during the day, to learn this stuff, and not just a face lost in the crowd. Same with middle school and high school - no more than 20 per class, to meet their emotional and maturation needs. ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY. The federal government is like a Deadbeat Dad who does not want to pay. So then, because we do not fix all these issues early, Deadbeat Dad gets to be employed by the local prison, where all his failed children wind up. Oh, and one easy fix that also costs MONEY - every school with more than 500 kids should have at least one full-time counselor, and every school district should have at least one full-time child psychologist on staff to supervise and advise all the counselors.",biggest problem education still using model cheaper still kid teacher classroom cheap also teacher female men profession would demand higher pay fewer hour work home already demanded profession choosing lucrative profession provide time work camaraderie colleague fix maybe school starting it grade class period specialist kid go room room switching every hour two two hour la minute math minute science minute spread week music art hour week social study history shorting i history enough hour week would work teacher would longer prep subject day would worry one could become expert however also mean need smaller class size max i income family kid america today hard every kid life poverty insecurity mayhem brings think raised single parent household kid life suck many way day system designed built small town life two parent family one parent home day handle emergency plus basic respect adult taught home teaching respecting place pecking order flew window starting one respect teacher anymore respecting teacher taught many home kid learning social skill respect home teaching duty fall school teacher spend hour hour every year teaching little kid function society main reason class never kid part large family day learn stuff face lost crowd per class meet emotional maturation need cost money federal government like deadbeat dad want pay fix issue early deadbeat dad get employed local prison failed child wind oh one easy fix also cost money every kid least one full time counselor every district least one full time child psychologist staff supervise advise counselor

highschoolteachers,"On the whole, I think TFA amounts to a badly executed good intention, and I am highly skeptical that it accomplishes any of the things it claims to on an organizational scale. BUT, as with most things, I think it can be a positive experience in some cases. My sister went into college wanting to be a teacher, was talked out of it by my parents, then got a work-study job in a preschool her sophomore year which rekindled her interest too late to switch back from sociology to education without severely delaying her graduation. She applied for TFA because it was the most direct route into a classroom, which at that point she knew she wanted. She spoke well of the training - a whirlwind, fast paced, sometimes overwhelming experience, but run by people who knew what they were talking about. The school she was placed at had caring staff, decent climate, some administrative headaches, like pretty much every school in this country. She did her two years in Oklahoma and generally enjoyed it, then moved back to Chicago and found that her license would not transfer to Illinois until she went and got her master's degree. Most of the people she met through TFA ended up in professions other than teaching, which the research I have seen supports, and the ones that stayed and succeeded were the ones that already had experience in some school environment. On a personal level, she still reflects on it as a positive experience. She even worked as a trainer for TFA over the summer a couple years ago. In my opinion, if you are going into it with experience in some capacity in education, you might be okay. If you have never stepped foot in a classroom as something other than a student, the training they give you will be insufficient and you could easily come to hate the job... A couple people from my high school went TFA and ended up in that boat, and are now all in law school or an MBA program. If you stay in teaching your license will restrict your options in some states, and you will be labeled a TFA teacher, which may not be a good thing. If you think you might want to be a teacher but you are not sure, go volunteer at a school, shadow a teacher, work/volunteer at a Boys &amp; Girls Club or recreation center or YMCA. Look into graduate programs that offer licensure and find out what kind of field experience you will get in those programs.

highschoolteachers,"Pull this young lady aside. Have an adult conversation with her, as much as appropriate given her age and maturity level. Calmly explain that this is your class and she is there at your discretion. Then offer her some kind of position of responsibility in class which allows her to be in a spotlight but in a manner you control, not her. An example could be having her pass out materials, get all the laptops powered up, etc. If she bites, and in time most will, she will end up buying into your classroom culture and help to enforce it with her peers. Of course it can take months for this to happen, but I have used this approach to successfully wrangle some very tough high school students who sound very similar to your ringleader.

Kiddos with moderate disabilities should not necessarily be in the same setting as those with severe because students are legally entitled to be in the least restrictive environment. So for example, high school students with moderate disabilities could be successful with a 15:1 classroom with access to the general Ed curriculum (or even ICT with appropriate supports) while students with severe disabilities could require an 8:1 with an Alternative/ life skills curriculum. All students should always be placed in the LRE, with the greatest access to the Gen Ed curriculum.

The only time they got into trouble for their phone was if she asked a question and you could not answer because you were not paying attention, which that was when you had to put your phone away, so kids paid attention so they would not have to put their phone away.

I teach high school math and get very strong feedback from administration and students alike.

A big part of that is precisely because I do not plan for the next two months or two weeks or even two days.

Today I will teach a certain topic and I will see how well the kids understand it. They may have classwork or homework to practice that topic. I check on their classwork to see what they are doing correctly or incorrectly, and I consider what they said and asked during the lesson itself, and often I even wait until the beginning of class the next day to see what successes and difficulties they had with the homework and what we do next is based on all of *that*. Did they understand the topic perfectly and just need to move on so they do not get bored? Were they completely lost and need to go over everything again but broken down into even smaller chunks? Did they understand most of it but need some kind of practice or lesson or activity to address one particular step or part of the topic?

Of course work hard, and do the best you can, but if you learn how to roll with the special education chaos and adapt accordingly that will be huge. Also with your kids, its all about building relationships and being positive. Have consequences for clear rule breaking (this will look different with individual kids and rules) but also tons of positivity and praise. Do Not baby talk, make it natural.

highschoolteachers,I taught one year in middle school and it was where the school readily hired me without full interview as I did not have to give a lesson plan example or demo teach. I found teaching middle school was more about managing middle school age kids behaviorally than the content or academic teaching. I was told by my administration that no matter what happened every student would pass my class and go to high school. The students knew this so it created a lot of behavior management challenges as I could not encourage them to behave for a grade they did not care about. I am not worried about your ability to handle the academics. My concern would be if you would be comfortable with constantly managing the middle school behaviors and antics. Especially if this is at a needy school where there are lots of behavior issues that come from home.,taught one year readily hired without full interview give lesson plan example demo teach found teaching managing age kid behaviorally content academic teaching told administration matter happened every student would pas class go student knew created lot behavior management challenge could encourage behave grade care worried ability handle academic concern would would comfortable constantly managing behavior antic especially needy lot behavior issue come home

highschoolteachers,"The HS I student taught at used RTI. Teachers would split up into 4 groups (one for each grade level) to discuss students that were on the list for RTI. This made things difficult for teachers who taught more than one grade level (aka most teachers in the school) because sometimes they were not able to say their pieces about all RTI students they had that were on the list due to being in different grade levels. Other than that, it was a pretty good system. Counselors were good about revisiting certain students cases after a period of time to see if any interventions worked. If nothing the teachers did worked after that point, it would become an issue for admin to deal with. This particular school had just over 1000 students and I think it would be more difficult for schools that are much bigger than that because the whole RTI meeting process would be more complicated.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; all the X people they have met are Y way and claim that you are not generalizing. Who said ""ALL"" are one way or the other? The OP said the immature behavior came from ""*mostly*'' the elementary teachers. And that just began a conversation of teachers sharing their experiences saying ""oh yeah, I can relate to that.'' Even elementary teachers (myself included,) find ourselves nodding in agreement. But we also acknowledge that the conversation splits among age level and school demographics (e.g. suburban vs. urban.) No one here is making a statement that ""ALL elementary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" nor are they saying that ""ALL secondary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'' We are just sharing our collective experiences and observations. ""Hey, I noticed .... too.""

And we even acknowledge on this Reddit that some HS teachers are cocky a-holes (see the other post about AP teachers.) But even then nobody is saying ""ALL secondary teachers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.''

Just like a good relationship you get out of it what you put into it. If you are driven, innovative, adaptive, cheerful and focused it makes it easy to care about you and your stated goals. So let me give you a piece of advice. Attend class every day, give your best, get enough sleep and use every opportunity to show that your education is important to you.

highschoolteachers,"Seattle-area born and raised, glad you are looking to move here! The Puget Sound is a weird mix of massive schools and smaller rural ones, as the metropolitan sprawl is blocked by mountains, islands, and rivers. There are high schools of thousands just fifteen miles from a high school of 400. For that reason, most of the smaller population districts hire PhysEd teachers who can also teach other subjects, like history or computer science. It helps give, for example, Sultan students the same variety of classes students in Snohomish or Bellevue might have access to. Definitely get your foot in the door through subbing if you can, or be willing to take a part time position. The further outside King County you are willing to go, the better the opportunities - and better cost of living. I mentioned Snohomish and Sultan, but Lakewood and Tacoma are also nice, and Bellingham is a dream. Granite Falls is improving every day. Difficult districts to teach in would probably be Renton and Tukwila, and Everett is hit or miss. My only big warning would be Marysville. Marysville is notoriously awful for teachers, students, and parents; administration is impossible to deal with and there is little effort to meet the needs of students with disabilities. Another option would be to teach in sunny Eastern WA for a couple years then make the move to rainy Western WA. They honestly feel like two different states. Eastern WA has been growing in recent years with increasing demand for teachers.

highschoolteachers,"My district did this when I was a kid. It had...flaws. Kids from the ""whiter"" side of town were bussed into the city for only three years of the 13 years of schooling. The remaining time, we stayed and the kids from the city came to us. So, they spent a significantly disproportionate amount of time riding the bus. Other than deciding to mix the kids together, there was zero social support within the schools and they were extremely segregated, both racially and socioeconomically. The year I graduated from high school, they stopped bussing, initiated school choice, and a ton of charter schools opened. The school district I attended is now considered extremely poor, has severe underpopulation problems due to white flight to other opportunities, and is in danger of closing schools. Thoughts on it all? If done well, with significant socio-cultural supports, it could be a boon for the community. If done like it was when I grew up, it will be a huge bust and because bigger problems. However, I learned a lot about the real world because of it. Most I was not ready for. Today's parents would rip their kids out of schools like I was in so fast that the people next to them would have whiplash. I had my first pregnant peer when in 5th grade. In 7th grade, the boy I sat next to in science saw both of his parents murdered and still came to school the next day. We learned to never sit on the ground at recess because there was a chance of used needles being there. Three kids committed suicide in 6th grade.

highschoolteachers,"I have only been at this 9 years so it is not like I have decades of wizened experience to share, but here are my thoughts. I have always been a high achiever: valedictorian in high school, summa cum laude at university, teacher of the year, state academic UIL teams, etc. I only mention this to say that I simply do not understand, at a fundamental level, the lack of interest most students have in anything school related; that type of attitude is completely opposite of everything I value. My first few years of teaching were quite the wake up call; I realized that my views of school were shared by, at most, about 5 kids all day. I have great classes; as you described they are obedient, do not because any trouble, and strive to do well enough to keep parents, coaches, sponsors, etc. off their back. At the same time, they would be perfectly happy if we did not do anything. There are always 5 at the bottom who need to be threatened almost daily. &amp;#x200B; After coming to terms with reality, I resolved two things. First of all, I am not going to stress over a student's work any more than they are; if they are not concerned, I am not going to lose sleep. I want every student to *want* to do well, but that is not realistic. I try to make lessons as interesting as possible, keep students as involved as possible, and help them in every way that I can. I give a every student a new chance every single day. I will not give up on a student, but I will not get any more worked up than they do. Much like you, I tend to gravitate toward the students that work hard and want to do well. There is always the rare student that you have a dramatic impact on; but in my experience, and that of others I teach with, it just does not happen as often as the movies would have you believe. &amp;#x200B; Thus, I prioritize my time in class. If Johnny is working incredibly hard and wants to master the material, I am going to spend more time with him than little Steven that just wants to be left alone. I will not allow Steven to be off task, but as long as he is at least pretending to work and not disrupting class, I am good. Steven may never use chemistry, but Johnny certainly will. Year after year, I am emailed by former Johnny's thanking me for preparing them for college; I have a folder full of letters and emails that affirms my decision to focus on students that want to learn. &amp;#x200B; My other resolution was to take a larger perspective. Most of the Steven's truly feel they will never use chemistry, but then they get out of high school, start looking into careers and all of a sudden chemistry is a prerequisite. I can at least know that even if Steven did not care as a 15 year old, I did everything I could to prepare him no matter how hard he resisted. So, in every instance I try to think to myself ""Okay, he is an apathetic jerk now, but maybe in 5-10 years when he lands in a college chemistry class he will appreciate the fact he knows stoichiometry."" &amp;#x200B; My advice is to do carry out your professional responsibilities to the best of your ability and remember that you are the adult with perspective and they are not. They may not appreciate you now, or ever, but I never want a student to look back at my classes and think ""man, I wish that guy had taught me something."" The teachers that give up and give in to students are awful cool to a 15 year old, but much less so later in life when they are sitting in remedial classes.",year like decade wizened experience share thought always achiever valedictorian summa cum laude university teacher year state academic oil team etc mention say simply understand fundamental level lack interest student anything related type attitude completely opposite everything value first year teaching quite wake call realized view shared kid day great class described obedient trouble strive well enough keep parent coach sponsor etc back time would perfectly happy anything always bottom need threatened almost daily amp i i coming term reality resolved two thing first going stress student work concerned going lose sleep want every student want well realistic try make lesson interesting possible keep student involved possible help every way give every student new chance every single day give student get worked much like tend gravitate toward student work hard want well always rare student dramatic impact experience others teach happen often movie would believe amp i i thus prioritize time class johnny working incredibly hard want master material going spend time little steven want left alone allow steven task long least pretending work disrupting class good steven may never use chemistry johnny certainly year year emailed former johnny thanking preparing college folder full letter email affirms decision focus student want learn amp i i resolution take larger perspective steven truly feel never use chemistry get start looking career sudden chemistry prerequisite least know even steven care year old everything could prepare matter hard resisted every instance try think okay apathetic jerk maybe year land college chemistry class appreciate fact know stoichiometry amp i i advice carry professional responsibility best ability remember adult perspective may appreciate ever never want student look back class think man wish guy taught something teacher give give student awful cool year old much le later life sitting remedial class

highschoolteachers,"I personally carry the game Math Dice Chase for such emergencies. Some other suggestions: 1. Kahoot (if it is allowed). I usually play a couple that relate to their academic subject, then let the winner choose one, it can be whatever. (This might not work well in classes that have a history of making inappropriate choices.) 2. Team vocabulary review with fly swatters. Kids make two teams them make two lines while teacher writes vocab words spaced over the entire whiteboard. To play, one student from each team goes forward and stands with their back to the whiteboard, with a fly swatter in hand . Teacher reads a definition, and students turn around and slap their swatter over the correct word. First one gets a point for their team. Thise students hand their swatter to the next student on their team andgo to the back of their love. The next students step forward and rinse, repeat. If there is time, go through the words twice. (This could also be done with math facts, ie times tables.) 3. Teachers Pay Teachers. I know there is some hate on here for that site. But a few dollars for a peaceful and fun class period is soooo worth it. 4. Play a trivia game or take a quiz using Plickers. You can hand the student cards out randomly and have kids write their names on the back, then collect them at the end, in order to keep record of their answers. 5. Look online for other ideas for learning games to play with the students. If the teacher does not leave me homework to assign, then I assume nobody is going to do any homework I assign. Because why would they? Use candy and/or stickers to reward. Even high school students like stickers, especially if they are smelly stickers. If the regular teacher does not bother to leave lesson plans for the sub, they have no room to complain about what does happen in their classroom when a sub is there. Next time, maybe they will leave lesson plans. If this is due to there being no regular teacher available, then admin needs to step up and provide lesson plans.

However they do not need to do it again. Same could perhaps be said for the students you are talking about. I do not always see the value in failing. Summer school is a joke. If you are failing and you are coming to class, chances are you have learning gaps that 40 hours in an I air conditioned room with 30 other kids will not fix.

highschoolteachers,"I used to be an elementary teacher and I once worked with an administrator who told me not to waste my time with remediation because the kids in question were ""statistically insignificant."" This was the last year I ever taught at the elementary level. After 17 years I just hung up my teaching certificate and walked way from this job. A few years have passed. During the interim, I went to culinary school. After graduating with honors, I spent a few years in the food service industry and returned to education 12 years ago as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.

Since I work with food, my students are motivated to be in the kitchen ... so I have less disciplinary problems than other teachers. Grading is usually a cinch.

Here are some options that you might want to consider. 1) Use your teaching certificate to travel abroad. I am a product of the international American schools. I also spent 8 years during my elementary career teaching abroad. There are lots of American schools overseas. In addition to teaching locals, they serve the educational needs of dependents of State Department personnel, business people, and missionaries. If you are interested in teaching abroad, check out [https://www.iss.edu/Home](https://www.iss.edu/Home) 2) Consider moving on. Find a school with a principal you can live with. I know that moving on can be hard but sometimes you have to do what is best for you. Most teachers spend a lot of time on their respective jobs.

highschoolteachers,"Every time I Have done Teacher Appreciation, I Have run it through student council. They tend to have a decent pulse on the school, on what the teachers like, etc. My experience is with high school, so I cannot speak for elementary or middle school teachers. I put together a cool thing with them last year that required a shit ton of work, but ended up being awesome. I surveyed the teachers to find out where they graduated from and contacted the alumni departments of all the universities seeking donated gifts. Each teacher got a gift bag with supplies and gifts from their alma mater. It was a cool way to talk with our students about college, too, and why we chose the schools we did. I personally think a discount would be better, but Ill be honest some people will not use it. If it requires work on their end, it does not feel like appreciation the way free stuff does! Not that Ill sneeze at a discount when its for something I want or need, but I will not go out of my way to get limited-time things like that. What teachers appreciate when being appreciated is time my best teacher appreciation gift was my principal coming in, taking over my class for 15-20 minutes, handing me a cupcake and a soda, and telling me to just take a break.

highschoolteachers,"I have not been teaching long enough to speak on trends but I can offer an anecdote. Last year, our admin introduced a new lunch system. Instead of an extra long class period with classes dismissing at different times to eat, we have a extra long period where all students eat and sort of office hours for teachers. Last year, most of our students used it as a time to sort of recharge mid-day. I never had a single student come to my office hours, but the attitude and engagement in that 5th hour (which had previous eaten last lunch and was no eating before coming to my class) was night and day. Other teachers reported similar results, with some actually having students come in for help. This was consistent with teachers who taught all levels, seniors to freshmen, though unsurprisingly, the freshmen were less likely to look for help. This year, while the seniors-sophomores are actually using the time pretty well, better than last year certainly, the freshmen use it like recess. We literally have freshman running through the halls shrieking. And not just one or two, this is large gangs of them. Our old crotchety union-rep now spends most of his office hours standing outside his door keeping these monkeys from injuring themselves and others and yelling at them to act their age. Freshmen teachers have reported similar things in class. This cohort is just, as a whole, ridiculously immature. Freshmen are always going to be the most immature of high schoolers, but this group is beyond normal. The last couple of years were nowhere near this. Our school is relatively small (400ish students) and socializing between classes is the norm (this has always seemed strange to me, coming from my high school experience with ~600 in my class alone, and my student teaching, which was even larger than my high school). Seniors dating sophomores, bffs in different grades, etc. This year, the seniors, juniors, and sophomores refuse to associate with the freshmen. Like, at all.

I taught Kindergarten overseas at an IB PYP program / International School and it was pretty fun. I would hate Elementary in the US because of the testing focus, scripted programs, and culture. I did not mind the emotional neediness of the kids (they were super needy) and taught my kiddos a lot of independence BUT my model had a coteacher (not in the room the whole time together - we taught different subjects but she did lunch and recess which were the hardest non field trip parts I AM GOING TO), only 14 students max, and was focused on whole child learning through the PYP stuff so it was not as exhausting as it probably is for you. My kids all had rich and relatively involved parents too -- though a few were sort of emotionally neglected. But parental attention helps curb the neediness to some degree. You still have to teach them literally EVERYTHING. I think teaching Kinder CAN be really fun. Singing. Games. Art projects. Reading storybooks. Creative writing. My kiddos were doing very rigorous work (to be fair, they usually came to me from preschools reading at a 1st-2nd grade level but most were reading at a 4th level when we finished the year). We wrote, read, they did math up to multiplication with my coteacher, we did science experiments.

highschoolteachers,"I would pretty rarely assign a 5 page paper (though I do not assign by pages but by word count when there are length requirements, and depending on your font and spacing rules, that could be pretty close to my research paper length) because I am honestly going to struggle to find time to carefully read and mark them. So, it is partially just because what you are asking is rare. I teach top students and prepare them for AP/IB so we write a lot but usually shorter essays. Honestly, in the 90s, I wrote a lot of short papers but rarely one that long. AP writing is fairly short so most of my AP classes required tons of shorter writing frequently. My senior year, after I would taken all APs, I took dual enrollment at the Community College and I do not think I wrote anything that long. In regular college, I did for sure, but I was literally a Writing major (English but specialization in Writing, not Lit). While I wrote papers of that length for my specialty college classes and even my Minor of Marketing, I think it was pretty rare I wrote anything that long -- but again depends on spacing rules etc -- for a Gen Ed. Though to be fair I would gotten out of most Gen Eds via AP or CLEP or dual enrollment. But my point is that it is a fairly decent length we are talking most likely. And in high school when I did write something that long, teachers often did not read it. I know my 10th English Honors teacher who was the basketball coach assigned long papers but never really read them. We would embed, ""Are you reading this?"" In the paper with no response / noticing. I always got 100s. One time I wrote pages 2- end on an episode of Buffy because I already had so much extra credit I did not have to do the paper, and nothing. My AP Psych teacher assigned long essays but he never made comments or knew who would written which topics. Also everyone with the pages got 100. (He graded short writings harshly to his credit.) The only other teacher I remember assigning anything lengthy was my drama teacher to his highest level class and we were only 20 and he only had one period. He did read and comment. But I think it was usually 3-4 pages, not quite 5. I often wrote over minimum because I had a lot to say in my reviews/analysis and he read stuff. I loved writing papers but always tried to figure out who actually read them because I craved feedback and to be heard. But I do think testing and low expectations are making lazier kids. I just do not think I would have seen that assignment much even as a top student in the 90s. Now the reading...I for sure had TONS more reading than kids today in comparable classes.

I remember my high school teachers laying out their grading systems would often talk about other systems they had dealt with. One system I often heard was the bell curve, statistically forcing the grades onto a symmetrical curve which groups the majority of the grades into the C range and for every A guarantees an F. With the bell curve, probably, less common today than in the past, how can you quantify grade inflation? Most teachers use assessment systems that quantifies the correlation between material presented with material mastery. The bell curve method quantifies mastery assuming that the top scores (however high) demonstrate complete mastery and low scores (regardless of the size in the gap between top and bottom) demonstrate total failure. If you had a data set where one teacher used a bell curve then, statistically, you cannot measure grade inflation.

highschoolteachers,"Here is a rant about our districts central office. I will apologize in advance for the length. I teach in a state where accountability for high school has been boiled down to Junior ACT scores. I realize the necessary evil of the ACT and other standardized tests. I get that they help hold teachers accountable and are one of the only ways for colleges to assess if kids are ready to take on college material. I do not agree with it, but I get it. Within the past month our English department was told we were going to switch around every students schedule in order to group kids based off ACT scores. In October. One quarter in. Our department decides to take Wednesdays and group everyone in different classes on that day, that way students (even seniors) get ACT RTI. Fine, I understand. I am not happy that my seniors have to do it because I teach in a rural county and I might have 10 total kids in my English IV classes that plan on ever looking at another ACT. I gripe, but I do my job and teach the groups I am given on Wednesday (yesterday). I was expecting a cluster...well, you know. But things actually went over pretty well and even my seniors did not really complain. Well, today our department was in meetings all day with our Curriculum Coordinator and our Director of Pupil personnel and they bring up adding another day for reading. We agreed that we would do a Reading ACT day in our own classes (once again, I have seniors and the overwhelming majority will not ever see another ACT) in the morning meeting. I go along with it, whatever. I still get 3 days to actually teach things that might interest my kids. The English teachers who have juniors then go into the meetings for the second half of the day (we only had enough subs for half the department to go at a time). They come back with the news that they have to spend 1 day on English ACT stuff given to us by a consultant our school has hired, and then 2 more days a week teaching out of this Mastery ACT book our district just bought.

There was a chance I was going to stick with it before all this happened, but these past few weeks have been the final nails in the coffin. Why am I so far in student debt if they can hand us scripts to read from and expect us to teach that. Why have I spent all this money on a masters degree when they could bring in someone from the street to essentially do the same thing I will be doing? Why do my seniors not get the chance to learn to like reading and writing by doing stuff that interests them in English, rather than going over the same grammar rules and reading bull shit ACT reading passages every single day?

highschoolteachers,"I think expectations have been consistently getting lowered over the years. I was not an honors student in high school, and I had homework on a regular basis. Now, its considered a ridiculous idea to give homework in non honors classes because the students will not do it. Work ethic seems to have dropped off because expectation of work ethic has dropped. That Is my view at least. For what its worth, I give homework occasionally in my non honors classes, and most of the kids actually do it! Its not much, and its only once a week or so, but about 75% of them do it consistently, which is not much worse than the percentage of my honors kids who consistently do their assigned reading.",think expectation consistently getting lowered year honor student homework regular basis considered ridiculous idea give homework non honor class student work ethic seems dropped expectation work ethic dropped view least worth give homework occasionally non honor class kid actually much week consistently much worse percentage honor kid consistently assigned reading

Looking for some kind of proof that you, an admittedly terrible student, were somehow wronged by all the teachers who ""gave up""on you? I do not know what you are after, but I will tell you that honestly, your kind is a dime a dozen. By the time you get to high school, it is time to learn to self-motivate, self-redirect, and get shit done. I have compassion to a point. I do not give up on students, but there is some kids every year who are just plain unteachable, and at some point I choose to focus the bulk of my energy on the kids who actually demonstrate that they care. I am sure there is a superstar teacher out there who makes kids like you their personal project, and I am glad that someone found your magic bullet. Great. I have probably done that for my students in the past, too, without knowing. But my course are overloaded, I am already unable to do the best I could do at teaching what I have already got because of multiple factors, and I have got my own needs and hobbies and problems to deal with outside of school. I do what I can for the students while they are in my room and in my school, but at the end of the day, at the end of the year, I walk away. You know what I find more obnoxious about being a teacher than anything else? The whole mentality that kids get to take credit for their success but I am supposed to take all the blame for their failures. In reality? I am thrilled when my students are successful, however that is defined. I love hearing about kids who were shitty human beings while they were in school but have pulled their act together and made something good of their lives. I am sure I played a small part in that, so yay. But I am not a social worker, I am not a mind reader, and I am not omniscient. I cannot magically figure out every student who sits in my room and makes little or no effort to be known. You go get to know every aspect of the lives of 140 strangers real quick and get back to me on how much you really know about them after a few weeks. And I rarely (not never, just rarely) obsess years later about what I could have should have might have done differently to deal with a kid I barely knew who made no effort. It is not that teachers do not care, it is just that the way you expect them to demonstrate caring and the reality of who they are and what they can do do not usually match up with your expectations, and teenagers are generally too immature and inwardly-focused to recognize the difference.",yeah sure want validation absolution shitty student still apathetic adult looking kind proof admittedly terrible student somehow wronged teacher gave know tell honestly kind dime dozen time get time learn self motivate self redirect get shit done compassion point give student kid every year plain unteachable point choose focus bulk energy kid actually demonstrate care sure superstar teacher make kid like personal project glad someone found magic bullet great probably done student past without knowing course overloaded already unable best could teaching already got multiple factor got need hobby problem deal outside student room end day end year walk away know find obnoxious teacher anything else whole mentality kid get take credit success supposed take blame failure reality thrilled student successful however defined love hearing kid shitty human being pulled act together made something good life sure played small part yay social worker mind reader omniscient cannot magically figure every student sits room make little effort known go get know every aspect life stranger real quick get back much really know week rarely never rarely ob year later could might done differently deal kid barely knew made effort teacher care way expect demonstrate caring reality usually match expectation teenager generally immature inwardly focused recognize difference

Like, are there actually human beings who wake up naturally at 6am??? Who are these bizarre creatures and why was their schedule preference chosen above ours? I live 15 minutes from school and can get away with getting up at 7:15 if I shower at night instead of in the morning. I did this intentionally for my mental health. A therapist once straight-out told me I might not be able to take certain jobs that require certain schedules. It is just something I have had to accept about myself. I usually aim for 6:45 wake-up. I am absolutely not at my most productive hour in the early morning and I despise people who are all ""go get  them!"" If it were pushed just one hour back, it would make such a huge difference.

highschoolteachers,"r/unpopularopinion But seriously, this is an important question our society has been ignoring. Yes, we do need everyone to be basically literate and numerate - people who cannot read will be a menace on the highway, at the very least. But beyond a certain point (maybe, 8th-10th grade?), should not we allow kids to opt out of school? A few generations of that and kids would take their education more seriously. Another strategy the US needs to seriously consider is adopting a European-style model of tiered schooling, where kids are stratified into different types of schools depending on ability/effort. Some kids will target trade schools and graduate with a marketable skill, others can take all the pre-collegiate courses they want. The districts where I grew up had 'magnet' high schools, which specialized in certain disciplines (e.g., fine arts, STEM) and accepted applications from rising high schoolers. If you were not interested, you just went to your local high school. The fine arts school had an advanced computer lab for graphics and web design, and the STEM school had a nifty robotics lab. No high school could afford that shit on its own.

highschoolteachers,"Well financially it is tricky. But there is also retooling. If I leave education I want to leave it completely. I do not want to go onto the parasitic side and work for EdTech or Curricular shit. I want to do Data Science, but that is going to require a good amount of retooling. I can code in a couple of languages but its probably not enough. Kids make it tricky as well. Teaching was a second career for me. So I know the type of time investment I will have to give starting out in a new field- the same was true for teaching. My kids are school aged and I know that I can not rely on the school system to give them the skills and knowledge they need. Being on a similar schedule to them assists in this. But I am not going to lie, I have been in this for 12 years and its the worst it has ever been and I see no light at the end of this tunnel. What has become apparent is that the consumer model of education has reached a new low, where the lives of staff are expendable for the glory of the high school athletes. That is what we high school teachers are going to work for next week.

highschoolteachers,"I experience a fair number of gifted students who have skated through our school system's elementary and middle schools. Most of our students come from extreme poverty and homes where their parents, when present, have no respect for school. Ultimately, the teachers end up focusing so much on the struggling students who need all the extra help that they often ignore the gifted students, who by comparison, seem super smart although they are really not. When they come to me, many of them openly tell me they have never had to study in their lives because there was no rigor involved, and they never really had to do any homework. They also have realized by high school that most of their teachers never actually read their work or offer feedback so they do not view assignments as anything more than busy work that is not important. When I get them, they suddenly realize they are not as smart as all their prior teachers told them they were \[a phrase I hear them say often themselves\] - and when they struggle with my subject, many of them just give up early because they have never experienced struggle.",experience fair number gifted student skated system school student come extreme poverty home parent present respect ultimately teacher end focusing much struggling student need extra help often ignore gifted student comparison seem super smart although really come many openly tell never study life rigor involved never really homework also realized teacher never actually read work offer feedback view assignment anything busy work important get suddenly realize smart prior teacher told phrase hear say often struggle subject many give early never experienced struggle

highschoolteachers,"From my personal experience- I was that student. I was a troubled youth who was fortunate enough to be accepted into and environmental charter school. It changed my life for the better, but my grades and work ethic did not reflect that. The senior project was worth a large percentage of our final grades. We did not do testing other than standardized. I did nothing for my final project. Not a single ounce of work. My teachers collectively decided to pass me anyway. They say me down and told me they were doing this because they did not want me jeopardizing my own future. Because of their actions against my inability to perform academically, 12 years later, I am now a teacher myself. I was able to be accepted into multiple private universities (with the help of my SAT score). I am now an advocate for environmental education and strong supporter of charter schools. Without that decision, my life would have undoubtably been more difficult and less fulfilling. A friend of mine during high school was in the exact same position as me. He did not complete his final project, and wailed miserably when they announced he had failed. I kept my mouth shut about what they had done for me and felt awful. He has since been subjected to alcoholism, depression, drug use, hospitalization and to this day suffers from his actions senior year. I will never forget the blatant favoritism I was a part of. I have wrestled with gratitude and shame over their decision for years. I have built a beautiful life for myself, and I see my friend suffering constantly. You have the power to make or break a persons life. But ultimately, what they do with your decision is up to them. We are bound by decisions made by others, and the consequences of our own actions.

highschoolteachers,"If I can be honest: yes, so many of that kind of student! Some it is clearly because other stuff is going on in their lives so school is not their priority. I get it, but it does suck. They will not get a do-over of high school, so I just hope that their life improves and they make it out with enough skills to make progress. Sometimes these issues are honestly really big and really suck and I just hope I contribute to them making it through, even if they fail my class. Sometimes these issues are not that big but I know they feel big to the teenager, and I wish I could help them put it all in perspective, but sometimes you just got to grow and learn on your own. Sometimes it is because they have not figured out their why/motivation yet. That sucks for me, because I can try giving them a bunch of reasons I think they should care, but some are just determined not to care. I struggle with this one the most, I think, because I am a person who cares about everything (hi, anxiety/ADHD), so I do not fully understand the mindset here. Sometimes they decide to prioritize their other classes instead of my class, proving that they are a capable student.. but just not for my class. On the one hand, I get it, you got to do what you got to do to make it through. On the other hand, sometimes it can feel personal, like I am the teacher they care least about or something, and that can suck. I have many friends who would probably claim to be that student. They talk about how it is partly about protesting the system, boycotting busy work and being so smart they were so bored so they failed etc. I admit I do not fully understand this one, though I try and I know I also see it. It is easy to claim that you obviously would have aced it if you would done any of the work but you were too smart to bother doing any of the work, but, frankly, we as teachers need evidence, so, sorry if the fact that we give you work to grade offends you. Some of them state their failing grades proudly as though it helps change the system. But honestly, the only person it affects is you.

highschoolteachers,"As a physics teacher for more then 20 years I would say the biggest pros are the summers off, the relatively high amount of autonomy, and the decent workload after the first year or two building up your classroom management routines and personal curriculum. In particular, physics has the advantage that many students want to take it either to look good for college or because they are interested in a STEM field but it is not required for high school graduation. Together those mean you often miss most of the weaker students and the biggest troublemakers. In the US the pay can be a negative although if you are willing to move you can find some parts of the country with decent ratios of pay to cost of living.

highschoolteachers,"The problem is that even under harsher grading students still needed remedial math.

They recited ""the mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell"" to get credit but had no idea what the electron transport chain did. I went to high school 6 years ago when every teacher gave 0s, when homework was still 1.5 hours/night, when phones were not allowed, and nobody retained that information for a year, much less long enough to apply it. I think we can all agree that many students do not deserve to pass. But the issue is that strict grading prioritizes optimizing for points rather than optimizing for content mastery. Many of the people I went to school with never really developed an appreciation for any of the subjects, and my opinion is that it is because it was presented as a series of tasks needed to get a grade rather than as a quest for scientific understanding.",problem even harsher grading student still needed remedial math still idea dna transcribed mrna base pair code protein recited mitochondrion powerhouse cell get credit idea electron transport chain went year ago every teacher gave homework still hour night phone allowed nobody retained information year much le long enough apply think agree many student deserve pas issue strict grading prioritizes optimizing point rather optimizing content mastery many people went never really developed appreciation subject opinion presented series task needed get grade rather quest scientific understanding

But in high school grade inflation is a joke - when the average grade is 80-90% there just is not room for an exceptional performance to shine.

highschoolteachers,"This is what I am wondering too. I have posted this in another thread on this subreddit before. My dad was not educated. He dropped out of high school, later became a nurse when it was still possible to be a nurse with a technical program (now requires a bachelor's in my state, but they grandfathered all existing nurses in.) I do not think my dad even knew what traditional college was. He did not know about the existence of college dorms. Had not the slightest clue what scholarships or college applications even were. He did not know what a bachelor's vs master's vs PhD was. Did not know what it meant to ""major"" in something. He never talked to me about school. Never looked at my grades. I could have had a 4.0 or a 2.0 he would not have known, and would not have cared if he did know. But I will say this, if he saw a video of me disrupting class, disrespecting my teachers, or got a call from the school that I was doing that there would have been hell to pay. I am glad we have moved past beating children as a form of discipline, and I will not sit here and try to celebrate or encourage it. But if I had flagrantly disrespected my teachers, threatened them, continuously disrupted their class, and my dad got a call from the school I would have been scared to go home. I would have been terrified if there was a TikTok video of me hitting a teacher or calling a teacher names directly to their face. He absolutely would have fucked me up. He may have not ""highly valued education"" but he would not stand for hooligan behavior. So I get how some of these parents also are not educated and thus do not really care about their kids grades.

The steps are not big increases and you do not start stepping up until after probation. Its literally not worth it at all unless you get a PhD. And that costs a fortune and is a luxury that most can not afford. The schools purposefully hire newbies so they can control them. They of course quit immediately.

highschoolteachers,"I have no recommendations for books but will happily share my experience. First, I am curious what level of buy-in will you have from your colleagues, admin, and district? That will define your experience. I am in a district that is moving 100% to SBG in an entirely top-down fashion, so my experience will be vastly different from someone who is moving to SBG in their own classroom out of their own genuine curiosity. I do not know how to distinguish between ""standards based grading"" and ""my own district's application of standards based grading,"" so forgive me if I say something that is specific to my district and needs additional context. Feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to follow up. In my district, we are moving to get to the point where all ages K12 will have their grades be entirely based on standards. In the elementary and middle schools, we are abolishing letter grades altogether, but in high school, we are keeping letter grades to maintain compatibility with the rest of the nation (but are pushing to have those grades be tied to standards instead of whatever a teacher may choose). We use the standard 4-tiered scale. The first thing is to learn that this is not a 4 *point* scale. Everyone wants to treat them as ""points"" which is wrong and frustrating to deal with. Correcting students' and parents' incorrect intuition will become your life. * Level 1: No mastery * Level 2: Partial mastery * Level 3: Meets expectations (the goal) * Level 4: Advanced/mastery Expect absolutely no buy-in from parents whatsoever. Especially if you are doing it on your own, make sure either (1) you are simply dipping your toes in the water and not upending the traditional grading model too much, or (2) you are an untouchable veteran teacher willing to make this the hill you die on. Grading is such a huge part of education, for better or for worse, and SBG rocks the boat well beyond an amount that gets the attention of every single parent and student. Expect very difficult conversations with every single kind, hard-working, straight-A student. We all have *tons* of straight-A students who are used to ""playing the game"" of schoolthey know how to turn work in on time, complete test corrections after their tests, resubmit assignments for additional points back, whatever. They are not used to being told that they are currently sitting at a level-3 understanding on a 4-level scale, representing that they have met expectations in a standard but have not reached mastery. They will interpret that to mean that they are being given a 75%, even though they did all of the work they have been asked to do, which they see as unfair. (Their entire educational career until that point has taught them the importance of ""playing the game"" which is the craft that they have mastered, so I have sympathy with themyes, it really is unfair.) When discussing SBG with colleagues, admin, or parents, expect for every single person to want to use the conversation as an opportunity to shoehorn in their own philosophy on grades, and expect everyone to be using different definitions of things and interpreting everything differently. Have you ever listened to two people discuss politics, and one person says ""socialism is bad, just look at Venezuela"" and the other person says ""socialism is good, just look at Finland,"" and you have thought to yourself ""um, I think you guys might be using two different definitions of the word 'socialism,' but that is none of my business?"" No one will have the same philosophical understanding of what a ""level 3"" is or what a ""level 4"" is. People will want to spend the bulk of the conversation talking about their own philosophies on grading instead of working towards a shared definition of what is meant by ""level 3"" or ""level 4."" If admin gets involved, expect clueless implementations that completely miss the point. I have had an administrator tell an entire school that all teachers *must* tie all grades directly to standards, and simultaneously tell an entire school that we *must* reduce the numbers of D's and F's. These are completely, 100% contradictory. A huge feature of SBG is that it takes grading decisions out of teachers' hands and ties it to more universal standards. The admin team literally ran reports of which teachers had the most F's and would confront them about it. &gt; &gt; Why do you have so many students on track to fail this quarter? &gt; &gt; Because I have adopted the standards and rubrics set forth by my department, and all of these students are objectively at a 'level 1' according to those rubrics. Maybe it is a terrible class, or maybe I am a bad teacher compared to my colleagues. Either way, these students are objectively at a 'level 1' (here are the assessments to prove it) and their performance is being assessed in the exact same way as other students, so even if it is a bit worrisome, it is at least fair and consistent which is a major goal/feature of SBG. &gt; &gt; &gt; You need to give fewer F's. That same admin team also unilaterally created a scale that said that a ""level 3"" should translate to a ""B,"" with no input from teachers or the community and with no consistency among other schools. This is a deep philosophical issue about what a grade *should* represent (if you have to have them at all); instead of being discussed at-length by all stakeholders, the answer was drafted up in an afternoon and thrown onto all teachers. There are many other philosophical discussions to be had, and none of them will be had. Expect to have difficulty with classroom behavior without being able to use grades as a carrot/stick, at least until you figure out a new paradigm. No extra credit, no participation points, no points off for late work. Philosophically it is perhaps not ideal to have to tie those things to a grade, but for better or for worse every teachers has managed student behavior by using their classroom grades. I AM GOING TO grades have historically been an important tool for teacher autonomy*you* get to pick *your* grading philosophy based on how *you* teach, how *you* assess, how *you* manage student behavior, etc. If there are new expectations thrown on you, your grading philosophy can be adjusted to incorporate the new stuff. But by tying grades to only standards, everything else about your teaching needs to find a new way to be enforced. If you cannot lower a student's homework score when they refuse to do homework, what are you going to do instead to motivate that student? Odds are it requires a cohesive approach from the entire school, or district, or community, and it *certainly* means you need admin or counseling to be on your side when you have an issue with a student. It also means much more work on your end. Instead of just lowering the kid's grade, you now need to loop in all the kid's other teachers, counseling, parents, etc. to find a new solution. Maybe that is a good thingit forces those types of issues to come to the forefront so that they can actually be addressed, but it requires an incomprehensible amount of time. I would estimate that the average teacher at our school spends maybe an hour peer week before/after school in intervention meetings with counselors/parents/admin/etc. to address things like a student's late work habit or whatever else. (Keep in mind we are talking about squeezing many meetings per week into short amounts of time before/after school, so any time you have a meeting that means you will not be getting anything else done that morning or afternoon. Do you ever make copies in the morning? Not anymore you do not.) It is a hell of a lot more time than we get per week to sit down with our PLCs. It is also just not as effective as simply giving partial credit for late work or giving a certain number of late passes per quarter or something. I think I am probably approaching the character limit so I will stop there. Overall my impression is quite negative on moving an entire district to it and I think it is a solution looking for a problem.

highschoolteachers,"Thank you for telling me about your experiences. It is very valuable to hear about it, and I find your perspective on teaching being more about the pedagogy than the content a good perspective to take even though I do not often think about it that way. Being in an elementary school really gave you new challenges and changed your perspective on literacy, and it made you able to work with many different varieties of students. As to why I do not want to do elementary, I value being able to teach in a way that allows the students to develop their ability to show insight into what they are learning and make new discoveries through the research and inquiry process. I want to go into depth about what we are covering and make the topics come alive to the students. I do not want to spend my instructional time singing songs, playing games, and doing social-emotional activities that are not relevant to what we are learning. In addition, I want to be able to give students the opportunity to participate in the learning process and creatively displaying their knowledge, something I do not think they can do sophisticatedly at the lower elementary level. I am against patronizing students in any way, which I think is necessary at times at the elementary level because they do not have the attention span to focus on lessons in the same way that middle school and high school students do. But to some extent, my dislike could be because I do not really know what they do in elementary (especially K-3) outside of my experiences as a student 11-16 years ago, talking to my former neighbor's children, and brief chats with customers who have young kids at my grocery store job. I have had roughly 15 hours of observation in an urban elementary school library before. The students were very rowdy and the school librarian was perhaps a little too strict with them. I did not like the experience.

If it is not a science classroom (or against a teachers personal classroom rules) and a student wants to bring their own snack, that is fine, but a teacher bringing food is unnecessary and I have rarely seen a reason for it other than 'cool points' or bribery. I get that it is an easy way to earn brownie points with students but to me it is just that, the easy way and not a way that is at all meaningful. It starts to teach bad food habits (food = reward), sets an expectation that teachers should be spending money like that on students, and also isolates. In the era of smartphones where everyone has a camera, I know of 3 instances where an obese student was filmed eating and the video shared to make fun of the student. Plus the big one to me, why are we putting students in a situation where they have to disclose their medical history, religious beliefs, or personal diet choices to the entire class of students so we can be cool?

highschoolteachers,"Out of curiosity, why are you so dead-set against elementary? I ask because when I first started looking for teaching jobs, I was sure that I wanted to teach high school ELA or Social Studies, but would unenthusiastically accept 8th grade - definitely not younger. I wanted to teach content that excited me - whether it be history with nuance or texts with depth. I wanted material to spark deep, Socratic discourse. My training year, I was placed into 6th grade ELA. The following year, I was moved into 4th grade Reading. That was five years ago, and I am still doing that (though I added Writing into the fold this year). Why? Well, one thing I have learned is that, no matter the name of your subject, *your* field of study is *how kids learn it*. In the case of elementary ELA, that is litera*cy*. By high school, at least insofar as the standards are concerned, that is more litera*ture*. Coming out of college, I was certain that my interest in the former far exceeded my interest in the latter. Now, it is the reverse: litera*cy* is a massive, terrible, beautiful, dark and deep monster full of utterly fascinating mystery and challenge. I teach fourth grade, and, after several years of seeing younger students from afar, I am comfortable saying that I would prefer not to teach younger than that. Also, after a year in a middle school, I am comfortable saying that I would prefer to not teach sixth grade again, and probably not seventh, either. I do still have some curiosity about eighth grade and above, but would only pursue such a change if/when I become bored with 4th grade or simply fed up with the direction my district academics team has been going. (From what I can tell, students and content in fifth grade are pretty similar to those in 4th, but where I am, 5th is middle school, and I would not want to make such a drastic environmental change without getting to experience new content and pedagogy.)

I still thought of it as problem sets and laborious computations. Then one day, one of my professors summoned me to his office, handed me a book and suggested that I think about a particular problem. Understanding it, I realized, required reading other, more elementary books. I would make my way down one path only to hit a dead end. It was not easy, but it was fascinating. My professor kept giving me problems, and I kept pursuing them, even though I could not always solve them immediately. Before long, he was introducing me to problems that had never been solved before, and urging me to find new techniques to help crack them. The mathematical research I was doing had little in common with what I did in my high school classrooms. Instead, it was closer to the math and logic puzzles I did on my own as a boy. It gave me that same sense of wonder and curiosity, and it rewarded creativity.

But the main reasoning is that I do not have the guts to teach younger kids, I do not want to mess up the kids' basic learning. I would rather try to ""fix"" some else's messes and/or put the finishing touches on the gems the kids are before I send them out into the world As I teach at a vocational high school, I only teach English and Social studies/Civics.

highschoolteachers,"Like others have said, it varies by state and area. I got my master's degree and leveraged that into a teacher specialist type role where I was coaching teachers, then applied to different AP positions. Regardless, most schools are going to want to see ""leadership"" roles as part of your teaching, e.g. department/plc lead, or spearheading some type of initiative as well as at least 3-4 years teaching experience. Then for principals, they generally want to see at least 3-4 years AP experience before you can start applying for principal roles. Regardless of all that though, focus on building your professional network and getting to know as many people as possible in your district. One massive disadvantage that teachers have is they are only on their campus, they do not consistently get off campus with others from the district. That was one big advantage I had in my teacher specialist role is we had consistent PDs and meetings throughout the year at campuses around the district, so over the course of two years I met every high school principal and got to know the people in my related position at each campus, including some district personnel as well.

This mom tried to tell me to excuse her son from any reading because of Lent, denied any of her childs wrong doing, blamed everything on the other students, would not discipline her child, asked that we start a boxing class so her child could just get his aggression out on the other kids, and with the end of year prank incident she said I made it up and probably had it coming.

highschoolteachers,"Um, ""It is by far the best literature to exist""? No. It is not. It is very immersive, but Tolkien, by his own admission, was not a storyteller. He was an historian, and created this fictional world in order to give it history. I love the books, but trust me, as a teacher, there is not a lot we can do with them for a class, especially given how much time would be required to get through them. My high school students balk at being given almost any reading, but the three books of the main trilogy total 1296 pages (432+352+512). If I wanted to get through the story in, say, two weeks, so that we could then spend some time talking about them, writing about them, etc, I would have to assign 129 pages per day of reading. Or, if I limit myself to a 10th grader-friendly 12 pages per evening, it would take us 100 days to get through them, in a 180-day school year.

highschoolteachers,"Listen in on conversations of veteran teachers in your building. I hardly ever hear older faculty complain about working around the clock (this year an exception due to Covid). Case in point both my wife and I have been teaching 15 years. We hardly ever bring grading home except maybe a little catch-up on weekends or holidays. Once you have lessons that work you spend less time making plans freeing up planning time for grading. That does not mean you do not refine plans and make new ones, it just means you do not have to do it every day. Also you learn over time that not every shred of work needs grading. Some things you are doing formatively to see if a student gets it or not. A quick glance over that will tell you where they stand and your comments to the students let them know that you are paying attention to them. They will still work without a grade because they want the praise and reassurance and do not want you to assign more practice. I teach high school bio. Each section I have roughly 2 graded homeworks, 1 graded lab, 1 graded quiz and 1 graded tests. Now that can vary as on certain topics I may do a project, but that is it. 5 things to grade per topic (approximately 2 weeks per topic). There is tons of other ungraded work, lab activities, computer tutorials, at the bells, etc but those are glanced over, commented on, and instruction adapted accordingly.

highschoolteachers,"This right here. If we were to spend the same amount of money on every extra curricular opportunity for students and they still chose sports good for them, that is their choice. But that is definitely not the case as we all know. We glorify sports in so many ways in and out of school. Nothing wrong with sports themselves but the emphasis and importance of sports has eclipse pretty much every other facet of school. Ignoring the actual legal obligations, if sports is the only reason you do school, how did you make it to middle school/high school? Its the images you see in media that perpetuate sports being the fantasy life that you can achieve through hard work, when in reality its an extremely small portion of even the most talented players that get called for that.",right spend amount money every extra curricular opportunity student still chose sport good choice definitely case know glorify sport many way nothing wrong sport emphasis importance sport eclipse pretty much every facet ignoring actual legal obligation sport reason make image see medium perpetuate sport fantasy life achieve hard work reality extremely small portion even talented player get called
highschoolteachers,"Let us say you are looking at Chicago Public Schools. CPS is located in a city where wealth is very, very segmented on race. The 30% of the city that is white is for the most part, exceedingly wealthy compared to the city as a whole (on average, they make 2.5x the median household income for the city). Meanwhile, about 60% of the city is made of predominately poor blacks and Hispanics. Now let us say that a magnet high school, such as Lane Tech College Prep High School, the number one rated school in the entire state of Illinois according to ISBE, has a 6/10 rating on Great Schools (https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1221-Lane-Technical-High-School/). Now, we are not saying the test is biased, but the data analysis definitely is. Somehow, by taking in more students that start at a lower level compared to the wealthier students, because those students are segmented on race instead of on wealth (like what happens in NYC due to its smaller income disparity between racial groups in the city), the school gets rated as mediocre instead of as a 10/10 school. Essentially, the tests are not necessarily biased but the data analysis being done by a third party (in this case, GreatSchools) most definitely is biased against greater diversity within a school.",let u say looking chicago public school cops located city wealth segmented race city white part exceedingly wealthy compared city whole average make i median household income city meanwhile city made predominately poor black hispanic let u say magnet lane tech college prep number one rated entire state illinois according isle rating great school help wow greatschools org illinois chicago lane technical saying test biased data analysis definitely somehow taking student start lower level compared wealthier student student segmented race instead wealth like happens ny due smaller income disparity racial group city get rated mediocre instead essentially test necessarily biased data analysis done third party case greatschools definitely biased greater diversity within
highschoolteachers,Here is the best high school in the entire state of Illinois according ISBE: https://www.greatschools.org/illinois/chicago/1221-Lane-Technical-High-School/ It is rated 6/10. Why? Because they have a minimum threshold of low income students that they accept every year. The ratings literally make no sense and the data they have on it even seems wrong. This is one of the schools that parents in Lincoln Park (overwhelming wealthy and white) will stay in the city to try to get their kids into because there is literally no other school as good as it in the entire state. Many parents that I know through work left the city when their kids lost the lottery to get into it. Yet Great Schools thinks it is mediocre at best.

highschoolteachers,"Depends what country (and state, if US) you are in. I spent 7 years in the classroom in FL. Statistically, most teachers leave the profession after 5. Teaching is a very rewarding job, but it also pays like shit, and America as a whole generally expects teachers to willingly act the role of martyr. It is why burnout is so common. I burned out by the age of 28. Luckily, early in my career, another veteran teacher gave me the best advice I have ever received: ""When it is not fun anymore, do not feel guilty about leaving. You will feel this coming, so have an exit strategy! Otherwise, you will be stuck in this career and be too burned out to find a new one"". I am glad I spent time as a teacher, and I will definitely go back to teaching at some point in the future, once I am retired. But I am glad I left. I see a stark difference between my friends and former colleagues that left the profession, versus those that stayed. It is hard being a punching bag for administration, parents, and (some) students year after year for shit pay. My advice? If you become a teacher, have an exit strategy. Go into it knowing that statistically, you will not be doing this forever. Around year 5, when the burnout started to set it, I began teaching myself to code. Eventually, I made the jump to coding. I now teach Machjne Learning trainings. My time is valued, and the pay is *much* better. I still get my teaching fix, and I help coach at a local high school on the side to still get the impact ""high"" that I got from helping students as a teacher. Teaching is great, and I am glad I did it, but I am more glad that I left before it made me depressed and bitter.

Actually it does because if you did not do it have fun sitting next game. My coaches did not play around. It is not an action as you are require to do it. Even in the pros you are looked down upon for not doing it. I dare you to go to an MMA or boxing gym and challenge someone to a spar and not touch gloves while they are and sucker punching them.

They just do not even bother to do the work at all because either they will pass anyway, or they will do credit recovery online (which in itself is a total joke) and they will still graduate.

highschoolteachers,"I had a parent about a month ago force a Zoom meeting with every single one of the student's teachers present in the same meeting (high school) and the district office present, which is clearly a HUGE pain in the neck to schedule. The reason for the meeting is that the parent *claimed* that all teacher communication had been unacceptable and that was the reason for all the student's variety of issues. To start the meeting, I carefully asked if she was having trouble accessing Google Classroom, the online gradebook, the parent email system, or any other automatic parent access that we have available, since I (and everyone) could see that she had not even accepted the *automatic* parent invite that all of these systems sent out back in August. I also carefully asked if we all had the right email address, since I use an email tracker and I could see that the various emails I had sent out had never been opened (I already knew we absolutely had the right address, but this was a much better tactic, to ""assume"" a technology issue.). Also, I snuck in a compliment for her attentive and witty student and their solid grades (at the time). The meeting only lasted another 5 minutes before the sibling (who was slightly offscreen) grabbed the parent's phone, signed her up, and handed it back. The parent then rambled for a bit, and the totally solid district representative just rolled on through the precedent I had set. I got a private thank you from the SPED teacher who had been saying the *same thing* that I had asked for the *entire* school year to no success.

highschoolteachers,"The kids at my school have a Discord server where the the students share past assignments with each other. Some of them FORGET TO CHANGE THE NAME ON THE ASSIGNMENT. I am a millennial high school teacher with Gen Z kids. They are absolutely atrocious with tech. I do not know what happened with the freshman this year, but they do not have any basic computer skills (I teach at a $42,000/ year private school so its not an equity issue). I have to walk students step by step to DOWNLOAD A FILE TO THEIR COMPUTER AND SAVE SOMEWHERE THEY CAN FIND IT. I have several kids who are not able to type with both hands. I have a few theories for why my 9th graders do not have basic computer skills. 1. Yeah, these guys were born in the digital age, but they were born when user interface has become incredibly simple. If there is not an icon or a big red arrow telling them what they are supposed to do next, they do not have the skills to figure it out. 2. I am just going to flat out say it, my ninth graders are helpless. They are not use to problem solving on their own, or Googling the solution to a problem. I Have spent this year modeling it for them. I am teaching them how to write a research paper, and if they cannot find what they are looking for in the top 2 results they give up and say its not possible. 3.

highschoolteachers,"I defo understand the lack of enthusiasm and how it can be soul crushing and draining. I basically made it my goal this year to see what (if anything) I can do to increase engagement. While its definitely tempting to just give up and wait for in person school, I think there is some things worth trying that have worked well for me. (Disclaimer: I teach high school seniors at a title 1 school so they are high on the disengaged meter but every teachers situation is different.) Cameras &amp; unmuting. I get why they do not want to do it. While my school technically **requires** it, enforcement is impossible. Especially when some students cannot turn them on without it killing their internet. What I have tried is telling my students how I feel. Like that when I feel like I am talking to a blank wall it drives me crazy and makes me feel like my work is meaningless. I tell them that this is not their fault but it is how I feel and that I need some people to have their cameras on for my sanity. This did not get everyone to turn them on (obviously) but it did help. I also give a (tiny) bit of EC for students who volunteer to unmute and who have their cameras on so that has helped as well. It is a little more work but I have trusted students help me keep track of it so not too much work. Student choice and independence. A couple of months ago I read an article about UDL in online courses and I found it to be very helpful. Online it is difficult to keep everyone engaged when the activity is passive. So while I am talking, my assumption is that they are on their phone half listening. I try as often as possible to make all activities projects etc to be their responsibility to complete on their own. And I try to give as many options for how to engage with it/complete it as possible. This approach takes more planning but I have found that spending class time checking in on their progress and giving feedback to feel much more enriching of an experience. It helps me feel like I am actually helping students make progress. Give yourself a break. It is ok to feel drained, this year sucks! You will make it through and your students will too. It feels bad sometimes but do not give up. There are ways to improve things you just have to keep looking, but do not kill yourself in the process.

highschoolteachers,"Spanish teacher here. Last year, I conducted class in target language 75-90% of the time. I had students creating meaning with the language, working in small groups on extended creative projects, writing and speaking and constantly pushing their own boundaries. We had an actual class culture. There was genuine rapport between me and my students, and between my students and my other students. This year, I am teaching my students Spanish in pretty much the way that I learned it when I was in high school back in the early 2000s. It is the way most people learn Spanish - worksheets and verb conjugations and vocabulary quizzes. Except everything's digital, any writing assignment that we do is almost guaranteed to be 80% Google translated, and you know what? I have honestly stopped caring. I have been teaching for 10 years. I know that progress in language acquisition is not linear. I know that students do not retain everything that they are taught, and that I will have to continue spiraling content up and down the curriculum. But this year, it is like trying to put out a fire by carrying the water in a sieve. A student in Spanish 2 asked me the other day, ""what does 'un' mean?"" That is where we are at.

highschoolteachers,"This is really hard for me to answer. I have been in situations in the past where I have stayed after school for hours to help a student who I do not even have for class catch up on her work so she does not fail. Or I have sat with a kid and walked him through an assignment step by step so he could just get it turned the fuck in. Or I have pulled regular ed kids who needed extra help along with my special ed kids (as a para). I do not regret doing any of those things, because some of those kids were willing to work their asses off and were just dealt a shit hand. But I have learned to be really cautious about stuff like this, because kids get really dependent and helpless on their own, and you are not always going to be there. Obviously you know your kids and their situation much better than I possibly ever could, but I would be really careful if they are totally unwilling to put forth effort of their own. On the flip side, there SHOULD be more options for kids like that who just need real world skills and if you can give them that you should. But do not give so much that you are running yourself ragged over someone who does not give a fuck and is not willing to meet you halfway. I think their age is a huge factor too....high school kids need to take more responsibility for themselves, while younger kids do need more structure.

highschoolteachers,Hopefully others will add on with some Florida-specific details. A lot of what you are asking is very specific to the building or district. I have often said I expect kids to be kids...so I did not see a huge difference between high school and elementary--it is just a different range of behaviors/knowledge but similar strategies. I have learned to protect my summers and use that as time to catch up on a lot of my side interests. The time is there if you learn to step away from the job. In the districts I have been in AP jobs tend to be more coveted--but that is district specific and you may find job postings that are assignment specific.,hopefully others add florida specific detail lot asking specific building district often said expect kid kid see huge difference different range behavior knowledge similar strategy learned protect summer use time catch lot side interest time learn step away job district ap job tend coveted district specific may find job posting assignment specific

A college would rather take an A mathematics student in Calc BC over an average student who took Calc AB and Calc II. They do not really see a difference in Calc I and Calc II...they are looking if you will be successful in college math courses (which most likely result in retaking Calc II at anyrate).

highschoolteachers,"I am personally not worried about trans students, but I am concerned about immature junior high and high school students who use this as an opportunity to use the opposite bathroom for the wrong reasons. The law says that school officials cannot question students who use the restroom of the opposite gender or require a doctor's note. I can already think of a few students who will try to use this law as a reason to use the opposite restroom. It also promotes students to use the locker room that they are comfortable with. Again, locker rooms are open spaces with little privacy. I do not think this is helping keep trans or non-trans students safe. Our school cannot afford to build extra unisex bathrooms or locker rooms. We cannot afford to hire locker room/ bathroom monitors and our schedules do not allow us to monitor these areas. We also cannot afford a lawsuit because a student, who is not trans, decides to use a locker room that is been assigned to the opposite gender for the wrong reasons. And staff cannot question or put a stop to it. I am not opposed to unisex bathrooms or locker rooms, but this is going to put my school in a huge financial bind unless government officials are willing to fork out the cash to build them.

highschoolteachers,"OP makes some great points and I really agree. However, as a teacher AND a former college athlete part of me wants to stick it to them harder. Calling them out by being adult and professional about the matter will stun them on the spot, but I also feel like they will respond with the appropriate amount of remorse to your face but then go right back to tweeting about it as soon as they leave the room. And you could check this because I doubt they will make their accounts private because then those who do not follow them cannot see their tweets. And since high school kids are soooo witty and hilarious, everyone obviously needs to see these tweets (am I laying the sarcasm on thick enough here?) Anyhow, in college athletics most schools have someone or multiple someone is to prowl social media sites of their student athletes. No school wants to pay for some idiot to get a free education if they are going to jeopardize the team or school's integrity. Now not all of your students are pursuing an athletic scholarship but many may be applying for other scholarships and later on all will be applying for jobs. People who are about to fork over cash for your education and/or future employers WILL go through their social media accounts. They WILL find things. They will NOT waste their time on people who do not know how to post appropriately. Today they might be posting about their teacher, tomorrow their boss, and then they are out of a job. I say make this a bigger, perhaps harder, life lesson. Screen shot those tweets. Put them up on the board. Heck put them on a worksheet. (I am envisioning the scene in Mean Girls where they make copies of all of the pages in the ""Burn Book"" and distribute them throughout the school... OK maybe do not go THAT far.) I have a feeling their skin will crawl to see their words posted on a big screen. Let them see how others truly do react. We post things online thinking we know how it will be perceived, but to watch someone live digesting your written word is different than sitting at home posting from the privacy of your own house. I say still approach the situation as OP suggested with, ""So I was watching the highlight reel, but it lead me to this,"" etc. If they (or parents) want to complain, guess what, it was on a PUBLIC account! Anyone could have read their words! And anyone JUST did (you). They will likely get mad because it is not the ""anyone"" they wanted it to be, but better to learn now then when the consequences are bigger. Sorry you are going through this. For what it is worth, know that there are kids out there that appreciate your efforts. I appreciate your efforts. I remember the struggle.

We do not all have to like everyone we come in contact with (although we should be civil, which I will address in a minute). Do not ever give a knee-jerk response to getting your feelings hurt in this career. Do not try to embarrass them or get them punished because you cannot take the heat. It is usually best to either laugh it off (if it is not super serious) or talk to them one-on one. Asking ""Why would you say that? That was really mean,"" is a good way to start a conversation. Now, if they have done something super disrespectful or libelous/slanderous, then you may need to write a referral, call parents, or even get a lawyer to send them a cease and desist order, but no matter what you are responding to, do so with two things in mind: 1) they are still not adults, and their shit behaviors should be viewed in that light; 2) your job is to help them grow and learn as students and as people; you will accomplish this far better if you can avoid getting antagonistic with them. You want to help them understand and correct what they are doing wrong -- you do not want to just be punitive.

highschoolteachers,"Be careful with this. Even in late high school not all of your students are going to be developmentally capable of understanding sarcasm yet. Even the ones who do understand that you are being sarcastic will also understand that you are being condescending, and how does that serve the needs of anyone in the classroom other than you and your pride and spite? Teachers who did the kind of thing you are describing made me feel uncomfortable in class, made me feel like their room was a hostile environment, and made me too scared to ask questions when I legitimately needed help. Teachers like you made me hate math. I get where the coming from. I am a teacher too (10th grade ELA), and my kids also ask questions about things I just explained. I know it is frustrating. I also know that it is going to happen because no kid is going to be able to stay on task 100% of the time. *Even most adults cannot do that.* You have to be in control of your own emotions enough to serve the needs of your kids instead of bullying them when they realize that they spaced out for a minute, missed something important, and try to rectify the situation by asking for your help. Be the adult in the room. Edit: This seems a little harsh on rereading it, but it is indicative of the strong negative childhood memories I have that are associated with this kind of behavior.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; conference with them after school and contact a parent. Apologies if this begins to border on ranting. The school I teach in is in an urbanizing town, suburb of a larger city. The way you suggest utilizing discipline tactics simply does not work in my high school. First, the student would skip the after school session. They see the classroom teacher as holding no power over that. The parent would also be next to impossible to contact. Either the phone rings and no one ever answers, or it is a disconnected number, or maybe you do leave a voicemail and never hear back. I rarely get someone who actually picks up the phone when they see the school's number. Now that the student has skipped my session, they get a discipline referral. Now the housemaster (assistant principal assigned to that grade) will assign discipline, first step is usually a detention. They will likely skip this if they skipped mine. After that, they are assigned Saturday school (8-12 on Saturday). Most students skip this because the next level is indoor suspension. This is where many of the students will serve their punishment. It has also taken a week or more to assign this discipline, so now it is removed from the original behavior that caused these consequences. The message has been lost. When all this happens repeated attempts are made to try to contact the parents. The majority of the time, this leads to nothing as the parent will not respond. It then cycles as the behavior does not change. I was recently talking to the senior housemaster, and he was talking about how he is been trying to contact a student's family about graduation (and the possibility that this young man would not make it), and was finally able to catch the mom when she came in to dismiss the student. He had an impromptu conference, the first time he had been able to talk to this parent in two years since he entered the district. It is a challenge. Edit: This is not the way it works for most of the school. I feel I gave that impression. This is just how it works for many of the students I teach, as I have the most remedial (non-SLIFE) math class in the building. There are also a few 9th graders each year where this is the case, but by no means a majority. This is just where many of the long-lasting behavioral issues are.",it conference contact parent apology begin border ranting teach organizing town suburb larger city way suggest utilizing discipline tactic simply work first student would skip session see classroom teacher holding power parent would also next impossible contact either phone ring one ever answer disconnected number maybe leave voicemail never hear back rarely get someone actually pick phone see number student skipped session get discipline referral housemaster assistant principal assigned grade assign discipline first step usually detention likely skip skipped mine assigned saturday saturday student skip next level indoor suspension many student serve punishment also taken week assign discipline removed original behavior caused consequence message lost happens repeated attempt made try contact parent majority time lead nothing parent respond cycle behavior change recently talking senior housemaster talking trying contact student family graduation possibility young man would make finally able catch mom came dismiss student impromptu conference first time able talk parent two year since entered district challenge edit way work feel gave impression work many student teach remedial non life math class building also the grader year case mean majority many long lasting behavioral issue

highschoolteachers,"I think we are the same person. I had a horrific student teaching experience and ended up failing my second semester on a technicality. My CT was awful; all criticism, no praise, undermining me and my lessons, talking bad about me to other teachers...just awful. She was actively seeking ways to fail me. Anyway, since my failure was a technicality and not some giant issue of professional conduct or inappropriate behavior, I was able to repeat that semester of student teaching. Except I could not. I felt the same way as you. ""Who the hell wants to be a teacher?"" I thought. ""Why on earth am I continuing to put myself through this torture? This is insane. I do not want to do this."" It took me *18 months* to feel okay enough with the idea of teaching to go back and finish my credential. I did a lot of stuff in the meantime; I nannied a ton of the time, I was editor in chief of my college paper (where I was able to work my ass off and forget about the horrors of student teaching), I took up a few new hobbies, etc. They all helped. When I went back to complete my credential, I got a really beautiful placement with good kids and supportive CTs. Nothing went wrong. I was happy. But I still did not want to be a teacher. I started teaching because my student loans came due and I needed a job, and lo and behold, it was what I was trained to do. There are plenty of people who think teaching requires infinite amounts of dedication and martyrdom, but I am not one of them. I enjoy my high schoolers; they make me laugh, and we can have good conversations about good books, which is why I got my BA in English and why I went to credential school in the first place. But teaching is just a job. It is work. You have a task to perform, and you come to work to do it, and then you come back the next day to keep chipping away at the task until it is as good as you can make it. It is only a vehicle for martyrdom if you let it be. The point of my big, rambling story is to take some time and figure out where teaching fits in your life. For me, it is a job I mostly enjoy, but it is not my entire life. For you, it may not fit into your life at all, and that is okay.

I teach for a period as a co-teacher in an open plan classroom and it is always a cluster fuck of a period. The problem is that we are teaching developing people with, largely, poor impulse control and self regulation and by allowing them out of easy visual confirmation range off task behavior is exacerbated. This problem can be solved using 'centers' for differing activities for small groups but that requires: 1. additional planning &amp; pacing 2. constant teacher redirection/intervention and 3. coursework amenable to that style of teaching. I teach math and history so a lot of what I do is front loaded whole group instruction and the open floor plan model just is not well suited to that.

Because of the standardized course (which is typical for a TA class or class taught by a lot of different people), this is a perfectly reasonable request. And, it looks like you did not follow instruction. This is unfair to the other sections and classes. If the rules for grading are so stringent, then get permission before going outside of them. This can also look like you are trying to alter the appearance of your own performance. We have standard tests and grade policies across high school classes too.

highschoolteachers,"Florida is done by county. The district I moved from there had 27 high schools and a truly absurd number of middles and elementaries. It made job hunting easy and if you moved within the county it was easy to transfer to a closer school and our union was fantastic. But district level admin was a giant building of slow-moving paperwork and red tape, and the people making the important decisions were so far removed from the classroom that it was not even funny. California is completely nuts in how they organize districts but I like the smaller, more local control. I have been here four years and I am still figuring it out. Pretty much every town has their own, i think? They are all sheltered beneath the county dept of ed, but they are their own district with their own school boards. But then there are some areas where just one elementary and middle school is its own district with principals at both schools and a superintendent. It is very common for school admin offices and district offices to be the same building. The very rural county I am moving to next year has 32 individual districts within it.",florida done county district moved school truly absurd number middle elementaries made job hunting easy moved within county easy transfer closer union fantastic district level admin giant building slow moving paperwork red tape people making important decision far removed classroom even funny california completely nut organize district like smaller local control four year still figuring pretty much every town think sheltered beneath county dept ed district board area one district principal school superintendent common admin office district office building rural county moving next year individual district within
highschoolteachers,"Cons: -The way the standards are lined up with common core do not always make sense... -We are assessed generally on state standardized tests that we never see (and from what I can tell from sample questions are very poorly worded and incorrect sometimes). I teach towards the standards, not the test, yet the test is 20% of student grades. How can I prep them for the unknown. (This is not directly common core, more about my state). -Extremely weak in statistics (our states interpretation often has errors, like trying to teach the difference between theoretical and experimental probability but then nullifying the lesson by making students think that they can just convert experimental to theoretical, using symbols meant for population parameters when they are defining sample variables, etc). -Constant reorganization and shuffling of standards, makes it hard to get in the groove and effectively plan -Sometimes jumping from subject to subject allows for students to not achieve mastery of things. I am sometimes in debate, is early exposure better, or time and mastery? Pros: -I like having a universal set of standards across state that make sense of the evolution of mathematics. I might reorder things personally, but the bonus of having standards across the country is a benefit to students who are transient (of which we have a lot of). If one of my students moves across the country, they should be able to transition into learning the same things. That is a bonus. -Some of the evolution across high school makes so much more sense. Teachers are able to make stronger connections. -Teachers are encouraged to use different methodologies that make more sense with context and spatial orientation and methodology that connects to other concepts and curriculum. -Ability to share strong lessons amongst teachers everywhere -Encourages problem solving, context based problems, and writing in mathematics. Question 2: I cannot really give you a full answer on curriculum changes as I am not the ones making them. I am assuming from feedback or looking at standardized testing...they are playing with what works and what does not from immediately seems to change. They have moved the quadratics unit between Algebra and Geometry 3-4 times in the past 5-6 years. How can I plan and get in a groove if they keep modifying things? I am at the point where if I teach three classes, I have to remember what year that student took Algebra...and if a student fails and retakes...it is a mess. Just for reference, everything in red marked on this curriculum map (a high level review) changed over a year: https://www.georgiastandards.org/Georgia-Standards/Frameworks/Acc-Algebra-I-Geometry-A-Curriculum-Map.pdf As you can see, that is a LOT to keep up with for a teacher who is busy in the classroom 8 hours a day. Luckily, I teach geometry so I was able to pull from that. But it is very hard to constantly navigate this year from last year from 2 years ago. Question 3: Right now I can look at the outcome of students from where then end up going to college and how they perform at our school...it would be hard to track beyond that (but not impossible). I do understand some merit in standardized testing in knowing where our schools are. They are poorly written and teachers cannot see the content of these tests (even after the fact). I do not believe in teaching to the test. I believe in getting my students through the required mathematics courses and being prepared for whatever mathematics courses they will have in careers and college. The end goal is to make them problem solvers and get them to be able to go on to the next level/position that they choose. While my school expects me to have a 100% proficient rate (we will see, I work REALLY hard with students), I have to ask, is that really a measure of success that rates above what they do in my classroom all year and what I observe?",con way standard lined common core always make sense assessed generally state standardized test never see tell sample question poorly worded incorrect sometimes teach towards standard test yet test student grade prep unknown directly common core state extremely weak statistic state interpretation often error like trying teach difference theoretical experimental probability nullifying lesson making student think convert experimental theoretical using symbol meant population parameter defining sample variable etc constant reorganization shuffling standard make hard get groove effectively plan sometimes jumping subject subject allows student achieve mastery thing sometimes debate early exposure better time mastery pro like universal set standard across state make sense evolution mathematics might reorder thing personally bonus standard across country benefit student transient lot one student move across country able transition learning thing bonus evolution across make much sense teacher able make stronger connection teacher encouraged use different methodology make sense context spatial orientation methodology connects concept curriculum ability share strong lesson amongst teacher everywhere encourages problem solving context based problem writing mathematics question cannot really give full answer curriculum change one making assuming feedback looking standardized testing playing work immediately seems change moved quadratic unit algebra geometry time past year plan get groove keep modifying thing point teach three class remember year student took algebra student fails retake mess reference everything red marked curriculum map level review changed year help wow georgiastandards org georgia standard framework acc algebra geometry curriculum map edf see lot keep teacher busy classroom hour day luckily teach geometry able pull hard constantly navigate year last year year ago question right look outcome student end going college perform would hard track beyond impossible understand merit standardized testing knowing school poorly written teacher cannot see content test even fact believe teaching test believe getting student required mathematics course prepared whatever mathematics course career college end goal make problem solver get able go next level position choose expects proficient rate see work really hard student ask really measure success rate classroom year observe

I love my upper level students, but hate dealing with freshmen. About a quarter of them should not even be in a foreign language class. They have no desire to learn the language, never do the homework, and do poorly on assessments. But because of our district policy, I am required to assist these students on my own time after school. You cannot help people who do not want help. Things would be so much better if students had to wait until sophomore year to take a foreign language.

highschoolteachers,"When I was in high school, I started a club and it quickly became a large club on campus. I did the same in college and by the second year, the club was the largest and most successful club on campus. Basically, I have experience with this. Create structure to your club in 3 ways. 1. determine the mission of the club, (everything you do will point to the mission) Mission of the club: to provide [insert high school name] students an opportunity to perform, participate, and watch drama performances. You can of course change it but this is a good starting point. 2. determine what you want the club to do (you have limited time and money, if any at all. It is better to do a few things well than many things not well. Master and then expand) It seems that for the first year, you probably only want to focus on putting on the one act. However, if possible, it would be nice to organize a trip to see a professional drama performance (to help get students excited) in the fall and then put on the one acts in the spring. Then of course have a big celebration! 3. create clearly defined roles (you can also create departments when your club gets big enough but that is not necessary now). You will need to have roles and make it clear what each one does: president - determines the agenda and leads all meetings. Manages all projects VP - in charge of recruiting and PR Treasurer - keeps track of $ Secretary - keeps notes at all meetings Director of One Act #1 - the director is in charge of working and rehearsing with the actors in their specific one act. This way, you can have all of the one acts rehearsing at once. It also provides more student ownership. Director of One Act #2 Director of One Act #3 (I am assuming you will perform 3 one-acts. 4. Figure out which one act plays you want to do. You are leading this project so you will have to help out with each and every one act. Look on YouTube for ones you like. You should choose at least 1 comedy and 1 drama. A quick Google search shows numerous scripts for one acts. Have a bunch of options and then let your directors choose which one act they want to direct. 5. Create an outlined schedule/plan AS SOON AS POSSIBLE and add to it as often as possible - this way you can keep track of deadlines that are set by administration (such s reserving a room) and by you (such as having a read through with all participants. This is hugely important and should be done over the summer. If you walk into the first meeting prepared (have an agenda that you follow, copies for everyone to Look at, questions for everyone, etc.) people will want to work with you bc you will look and act like you know what you are doing. 6. Recruit people now for the roles listed above. The key here is to find kids who are interested and not overbooked. Anyone who is already doing multiple activities will not have enough time (most likely). 7. Talk to administration so you know who to e-mail over the summer if you have questions. Your goal over the summer (when you have the most time) is to create the tracks that you can ride for the rest of the year. 1. Figure out which one acts you are going to do. 2. Determine how you will reach out to students for an informational meeting (students respond to many different mediums - announcements, fliers, etc. See if you can talk to specific teachers and maybe you can go into their room to talk about it for 5 minutes). If you can create a flier quickly that is great. Put in fake info and you can change it later when the time and location become set. 3. What will you say at the informational meeting: what is the club. What is a one act. How students can be a part of it (acting, building sets if necessary, lighting, directing, etc.), how will you determine who will be directing and acting, etc. how often will students prescribe. When and where is rehearsal. When and where is the performance. 4. Coordinate with administration when and where is a good time for the one acts. If you schedule the performances at the end of. A quarter know that you will stress everyone out, including yourself. If you schedule it immediately after spring break, you will have people who will not rehearse during spring break and you risk then getting rusty. 5. Create a list for everything that you have to do and start making a schedule for when they will get done and by whom. Lastly, you are about to enter into management. Managing is tough. If you act like you know what you are doing, most people will not question you, but you also have to show others why they will benefit if they do what you want. Having a frank conversation where you ask students what they want to do and get out of the experience, and then connect a role and responsibility to what they said (and describing how they are related) is one of your best tools in getting people on your side.

highschoolteachers,"Not a journalism teacher, but I was a journalism major in college and I really wish elementary schools had newspapers. I had an amazing advisor in high school who created an incredible, student-run newsroom for us. Make sure you teach your kids how to write a standard news article (inverted pyramid), and then teach them how to write other, more fun types, like features once they have mastered that. And then how to conduct an interview. And then practice, practice, practice. Do all of this before your first issue comes out, whether it is print or digital (assuming you publish). If you want to read up on writing, I can dig up some book lists from college that might be useful to you! (if you do not have a journalism background, that is.) Develop strong relationships with admin/department heads/well-liked teachers and coaches/etc. They do not have to love you, but there should be clear mutual respect. You will need admin on your side should any major news break. We could not have covered half of what we did in high school without the support of our admin, because our advisor made a point to form strong relationships with all of them, and, in turn, helped coach us through how to best interact with them so we had no qualms waltzing into the office to request an interview with even the scariest of vice principals. Even if you are not publishing, students can still practice interviewing important people on campus! Teach ethics, and consequences of unethical practices. The [Student Press Law Center](http://www.splc.org/) will be your best friend. They have amazing resources for ethical and legal issues, as well as some resources for teachers that look pretty solid. If you have the budget, invest in some tape recorders for interviews. And figure out whether your state is a [one-party or two-party consent state](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations). Regardless, teach students to always ask for permission to record conversations at the start of the interview, and to record the entire thing, just in case. Teach them how to take notes during the interview of important things the person is saying, rather than trying to transcribe the entire interview in the moment (which also makes transcription of tapes infinitely easier and I wish I had learned to do this in high school). And, again if you have the budget, consider some reporter's notebooks to go along with those recorders. And I want to echo the advice to have a clear hierarchical structure. If it is an intro class, you probably will not have many veterans to turn to for editorships, but you still need student leaders/editors. And journalism is a great place to develop such a variety of leadership skills. Use that to your advantage. The more they feel they own the publication, the more they will put into it. But, you need to be willing and able to step in with a firm hand and calm voice of reason if things get out of hand. At the end of the day, you will need to have final approval of anything they are working on. Do not flaunt it, but everyone needs to be aware. Do not let that stop them from taking risks, but prevent any and all disasters from ever starting. If you are printing/publishing something, make sure you know whatever software you are using like the back of your hand, so you can help students when issues arise. And make sure to train them before you let them on, even if they say they already know how to do it. You will always need to do things like set the proper margins, format tags properly, etc. Even if you do not regularly publish, consider mocking up layouts or a private wordpress anyway. And then find an outlet to publish articles anyway, because it becomes so much more powerful when you see it in print and know people are reading it. And also the advice to reach out to local journalists is great. Form relationships with local publications. Most reporters I know love talking about their work with future journalists, whether to a whole class or one-on-one. Maybe also see if you can get a photojournalist to come in and give a talk because photojournalists are just really cool, and could get kids jazzed about another aspect of journalism to explore. Also, look into local programs for high school journalists, and encourage students who truly seem passionate about journalism to go for it. Visit a local newsroom, even if it is at a college. Even though a daily (or even a weekly) is wildly different from a high school newsroom, it can be an eye-opening experience. Clearly I am still very passionate about journalism, so i will stop there. I wish you the best of luck!!

(And it is pretty popular with districts out here, so being familiar with it is not a bad thing.) 2) A custom self-inking stamp. I stamp kids entry/exit tasks and notes they need to participate in discussions. Works well to get them on task.

Granted...most of the time he will sit and just do homework and ask me questions every now and then. I will help him before tests, etc. Well...his test scores have only slightly improved. Maybe 5-6% overall. He is going to pass the class, but maybe not with the grade he wants. How do I feel about it? Not that bad really. It is a difficult class. Not everyone is brain is wired the same way. When students confront me with the perceived difficulty of science/math classes I confront them right back. What about history and english? What about foreign languages? I have difficulty learning a foreign language, but no difficulty with science and math. I do not feel slighted...some people are just better in various areas. The reason we have things like Honors and [to some extent] AP classes is because there are different kinds of students. I have kids in my on-level Chemistry class making C's and B's who are also in APUSH making an A--and APUSH is not easy for them. No one is an expert at everything. People in TV shows and movies are fake. No one person can be an expert in Quantum physics, Computational Chemistry and Psychology all at once. There is a reason we work in collaborative groups as adults. There is a reason it is called a ""Think-tank"" (because you get a collective of experts). I do not expect all of my students to pass every learning objective. It just is not viable and no matter how hard you try you cannot change the fact that our brains are not made to be a ""jack-of-all-trades"".

highschoolteachers,"Find out what novel sets, textbooks, etc you have, as well as curriculum and unit plans that you are expected to cover. If you have no set curriculum, do end-design planning to decide what units you will cover. Make a rough outline of your year broken down into units.

Decide how you will organize paper (all. the. paper.), set up Google Classroom, Google Docs, Google everything (because it is awesome), make a plan for how you will return student work (going paperless? do they have 1:1? will you let them take tests home? individual files/hanging folders?).

highschoolteachers,"I have not taught journalism at the high school level, but I was editor in chief of my college paper. Do you know if you have the budget for a print newspaper, or will you be entirely online, or are you publishing at all? Our biggest struggle was removing/inserting errors into articles. With high school kids especially, taking that time at the beginning of the year to go over what you should look for when writing/editing will help a ton. Another suggestion is to have a clear hierarchical structure, if you are publishing. The students cannot in any way think they have a say. A newspaper will crumble if it is given a democratic structure. A good paper is a dictatorship. :) Most of all, encourage your kids to try something risky, whether it is with design or content (not stupidly risky, but something that is out of the norm). This and maybe their college paper are the only places they are going to get to take those risks. Do not be afraid of letting them have fun. Make sure you get lots of AP Stylebooks!

highschoolteachers,"Especially for high school, math positions are hard to fill because they can go to into something other than teaching for a lot more money. I am a hs math teacher and I essentially have a math degree with a teaching certificate. If I wanted, I could look into many different options for careers because I have had so much math. That is the difficulty we have ran into in the past.

highschoolteachers,"Hi, I graduated with a BS in CIS and worked as an IT professional for 10 years before I started the transition and entered an MAT program for mathematics education. I am math certified and with one exam I have added my business education certificate for 6-12, so I can teach many more course that fell under my CIS degree. I do not think in general CIS masters qualifies you to teach at a college (they might allow it due to needs in the area though). You can teach at high school level as many schools have needs in technology, but keep in mind, the pay is less if you are not teaching certified. In my experience CIS prepares you for IT consulting and IT management at large companies, and most schools would be willing to hire someone with CIS and several years working in the field, not just someone with a masters in CIS. Most states and schools have a MAT in Business Education (which includes topics covered in a CIS degree, but more pedagogical and teaching oriented classes), or you can simply get a certification in business education. Again, the masters will pay more. If you are between the fence, you could get a CIS MBA, and pair it with a certification in Business Education with a couple more courses. I could get more detailed for you if you are in Georgia. What I would suggest first is to make sure that you like and want to teach as it is a lot of time and energy to invest in something you may not love. Teaching is so different that I thought it would be, and while I love it, I am so glad that I experienced it first before making the jump.

highschoolteachers,"I worked a stressful job in corporate america year round and decided to change careers to become high school certified in mathematics and business education. My summer off this year consisted of taking a 6000 level math course that met daily, and 2 mathematics teaching technology courses. I had classes for 3 hours every day and spent another 5 hours performing required homework and studying. On top of that I missed days as I had to travel to my school for meetings and planning. I will say, even if you get a summer off, teaching is so different and so energy and life consuming. Even if the duration is 9 months, you spend 8 hours of your day on your feet giving presentations or facilitating meetings all day. You rarely get a lunch or even time to go to the restroom. You have to learn how to communicate effectively and clearly with constant distractions happening. You are making 8 critical decisions every 10 seconds. You are expected to be awake, alert, and on point at all times. Outside school hours you are supporting students in clubs, activities, and tutoring. You are grading, writing and preparing lessons, communicating with parents during that time. I think the biggest difference between teaching and working an office job is that when I worked in an office and went home at night, I was off work. I was relaxing and taking some time to myself. During the school year, it never really stops. You are talking about your students all of the time, you are worrying about them. I even wake up in the middle of the night sometime and grab my computer to create supplementary materials for a student that did not quite understand a concept in class. The difference is during my 9 months of teaching, I am working every minute of the day and thinking about my students...so our summers are spent in working around the clock so much!",worked stressful job corporate america year round decided change career become certified mathematics business education summer year consisted taking level math course met daily mathematics teaching technology course class hour every day spent another hour performing required homework studying top missed day travel meeting planning say even get summer teaching different energy life consuming even duration month spend hour day foot giving presentation facilitating meeting day rarely get lunch even time go restroom learn communicate effectively clearly constant distraction happening making critical decision every second expected awake alert point time outside hour supporting student club activity tutoring grading writing preparing lesson communicating parent time think biggest difference teaching working office job worked office went home night work relaxing taking time year never really stop talking student time worrying even wake night sometime grab computer create supplementary material student quite understand concept class difference month teaching working every minute day thinking student summer spent working around clock much
highschoolteachers,"I had a pretty fun student teaching experience, but my wife and my roommate both had terrible experiences and ended up changing placements. I will write about all three separately. Mine: I was a music ed student. I student taught 6-12 band but going backwards (oldest kids in the morning, 6th graders last period). I had two CTs. The high school CT dropped me in Jazz band to fend for myself from day 1 and dropped me with the lower HS band in week 2. He payed very little attention to what I was doing and let me pretty much roll with the baton. It was fun, but it was scary-like I could easily screw this up and no one would know-scary. In middle school I was watched a little more closely and I had extremely difficult kids (inner-city). Planning for this ate up most of my time, but I always felt like I was skating compared to my wife (fiance at the time) and roommate. I ended up not going into teaching though because of the low pay and politics. Wife (Jane for reddit purposes): We will call her CT Amy (neither real names). Amy expected Jane at school at a particular time. When Jane walked in a square 30 seconds late, it was a *huge* deal. She would regularly tell Jane that she was not as prepared as she should be. Jane would come in and spend ten to thirty seconds to do something in the morning, but be told she should have done it the night before. None of this would have been particularly major were it not for the fact that Amy would report Jane every time. If Jane asked Amy a question -*any* question- she would be told that she was un-prepared. At the end of the first month, Jane was told she had way too much negative paperwork and she might get dropped from Stu-teaching. Jane let Amy report her one more time before requesting a new placement. Roommate (John): we will call his CT Mary (again neither are real names.) Mary was famous in the school for bad-mouthing the other teachers behind their backs and then being perplexed when none of them liked her. She had been at it for years before John became the stu-teacher. Her habit of being negative carried over to John because of his inability to be *impatient* with the students and she would make him write and re-write his lessons until he had two weeks worth of sub-plan like write-ups that scripted exactly like *she* would do it. The last straw was when another teacher told John she had heard Mary saying she did not think John had done well enough to merit any sort of letter of recommendation. John asked for another CT an hour later and was granted.",pretty fun student teaching experience wife roommate terrible experience ended changing placement write three separately mine music ed student student taught band going backwards oldest kid morning the grader last period two it it dropped jazz band fend day dropped lower i band week payed little attention let pretty much roll baton fun scary like could easily screw one would know scary watched little closely extremely difficult kid inner city planning ate time always felt like skating compared wife fiance time roommate ended going teaching though low pay politics wife jane reddit purpose call it amy neither real name amy expected jane particular time jane walked square second late huge deal would regularly tell jane prepared jane would come spend ten thirty second something morning told done night none would particularly major fact amy would report jane every time jane asked amy question question would told un prepared end first month jane told way much negative paperwork might get dropped stu teaching jane let amy report one time requesting new placement roommate john call it mary neither real name mary famous bad mouthing teacher behind back perplexed none liked year john became stu teacher habit negative carried john inability impatient student would make write write lesson two week worth sub plan like write ups scripted exactly like would last straw another teacher told john heard mary saying think john done well enough merit sort letter recommendation john asked another it hour later granted

highschoolteachers,"Mine was interesting. I did my licensure in Memphis before the country and city schools combined so I had a junior high placement at a then Memphis City school and a high school placement at a Shelby County school. Some background for those who do not know, Memphis has one of the worst school situations in the country, it is absolutely awful, which is why you can make upwards of $70k after a few years, but I digress. Before the consolidation of the districts (and then the suburbs forming their own districts) it was pretty widely known in our program that Memphis city was to teach you classroom management and Shelby county was to teach you everything else. So my first placement was in a low-performing middle school teaching 8th grade Social Studies. I was one of two white men on campus teaching 120 students split about 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic (about half of whom spoke English). I learned more about managing a classroom in 8 weeks than I ever learned in school. Luckily, my cooperating teacher was always in the room with me and gave me the backup I needed when I inevitably got accused of racism by the students. Most of the students were there most of the time but I had about 1/4 who out of the 8 weeks of my assignment I saw them about 5 days. It was rough, I spent much more time getting kids to sit down and stop fighting than I ever did teacher, which is what convinced me that I am not right for those type of situations. I did have one honors class that was absolutely delightful, I never had to get on to them and I was able to do a TON of actual teaching with them, which is probably what saved me. My Shelby county placement was a dream. I was teaching Honors World History and US Government and after a week of observation, my cooperating teacher told me the classroom was mine and just let me do my thing. I had complete control and I LOVED it. I was able to establish relationships with the students and looked forward to going to school everyday. All in all, my advice is this: 1. You get out of student teaching what you and your cooperating teacher put into it. If either of you do not make the effort and try, you will not learn a thing. 2. Next, ask for help! If you do not get any from your cooperating teacher, site supervisor, or administration, tell someone so you can get it fixed. 3.

highschoolteachers,"It is really going to depend on your programs and your cooperating teacher. I majored in special education in Wisconsin. I had a full year practicum in a middle school history/language arts classroom with a gen ed teacher to learn about that side of things. First semester I was only there one day a week for a few hours. I was basically an assistant, helped with a weekly email to parents and talked planning. The second semester, I was there four hours a day four days a week. It worked out that she had two groups of students, AM and PM. So even though I only saw the AM students, she was just doing the same thing in the afternoon with new kids so I felt like I had a pretty good experience. My teacher was really OK with almost anything. I taught a whole history unit I made and some parts of the day sort of became the time I took over. But mostly I observed and did assistant type things. It was a great opportunity to just talk to a teacher about things like organization, overall curriculum planning, politics around education, etc. In my final year, I was a full time student teacher. But in special Ed you are certified k-12 so my first semester was in an elementary school and my second semester was at a high school. At the elementary school, I went to the school in August and did PD with my teacher and although it was not required, it made the year start off much smoother as I was not learning everything all at once (not just being a teacher, but the layout of the school, IEPs of students, met staff before they were in the throes of school year, etc.). My cooperating teacher was awesome! We game planned how each day would go (which SEA would be with which kid, what groups we would need) and planned on me taking one reading and one math group and she would take one reading and one math group. I really felt like I was part of the planning and the team in general (I got a lot of time working with the gen ed teachers we supported too and they let me lead whole class lessons sometime too) At the high school level, I planned and taught our self-container math class every day, helped out in the resource room we ran for one block a day and then my cooperating teacher and I supported a gen ed history class. I made alternate materials/assessments and contributed in the history class to the general discussion as best I could (I was also a double major in history so it was a fun class for me to support). In our seminars, my fellow student teachers and I would just talk about our weeks. What I really found out was as long as you had a supportive cooperating teacher, the role is really what you make it. Need to practice parent communication? Ask if you can send emails or be the one to make a call home. Classroom management? Come up with something you lead the class in every day that gives you the opportunity to be in front of them. I remember some girls in my program seeming kind of unsure of what they were doing or feeling like they were not getting direction from their cooperating teachers, but you really just got to try things. You cannot get fired (unless you are REALLY bad I guess), so do not be afraid to try new things, even if they do not work. You have someone with you to help out in case something goes wrong, a luxury you will not have later. Do not be afraid to be unknowledgeable or make mistakes! Even if there was something I thought I knew for sure, I enjoyed playing dumb or naive at times (because you are in a sense! You are only a student teacher. People should be understanding) and trying to get the best advice I could from other teachers.

highschoolteachers,"It was interesting. I could not decide which grade level I wanted to do since I was being certified grades 7-12, so I was one of very few (maybe the only) in my cohort to split the semester up. I spent 8 weeks in 8th grade at a middle school and 8 weeks in 11th and 12th grade at a high school just down the street from the MS. I was hoping the two experiences would make it clear which age group I preferred, but I really did not end up with a preference at all (and still do not). My 8th grade placement teacher had me just watch for about 2 weeks, then we co-taught for a bit, then the last 2-3 weeks I pretty much did everything on my own. She had a very clearly outlined curriculum, and I just followed it. I also put in grades and sat in on parent-teacher conferences, all with her oversight. At my second placement, my teacher quickly let me take over her classes after seeing that I was relatively capable of doing so. By the end of my time there, she rarely came in to school at all (which is highly illegal, but our room was out in BFE and no one ever came to check on us) and I did everything. She wrote me one of the nicest letters I have ever received about how amazing I was as a teacher and how she would want her kids to have me. Overall, I enjoyed my student teaching and felt relatively prepared. Yeah, no. Maybe it is because I moved to a different state, or had a totally different student population, but NOTHING about my student teaching prepared me for having my own classroom. My students now are nothing like the ones in my student teaching, and a huge part of teaching is lesson planning, which is pretty much all done for you when you student teach. I had to come up with several of my own (very long and thorough) lesson plans for university administrators when they came to observe me, but other than that, I was following what my cooperating teachers had already had planned.

highschoolteachers,"I got my first job working part time (0.6 FTE) in a large public school. I wanted to work full time and found myself in a similar position my second year and ended up in a charter school in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I am starting my fifth year there and I agree with everyone else there are pros and cons. Here is what I have found ... PROS: - I have total freedom over my curriculum (yes I have to meet state standards and testing but I do not have to keep pace with other teachers as I am the only math teacher for my grade level) - I know all the students - charters tend to be smaller so I get to build real relationships and watch my students through the rest of high school. - I plan my own development. My school encouraged development, and includes a lot of training in their program. The teachers pick what to focus on each year for weekly development. - Smaller class sizes (we cap at 25, way better than the 40 I had in one public school class) CONS: - Teachers do not have a union and sometimes our frustrations go unheard at the administrative level. - We get paid less than public school teachers (like $10-$12,000 less per year) - We work longer hours, because I do not have peers teaching the same class I do all the planning and curriculum creation which takes time. We also do home visits for all 25 of our homeroom students each year and have a few other additional requirements. Bottom line, if the school seems good to you try it. You can gain experience and insight into teaching in any setting. Ruling a school out solely because it is public, or charter, or private is going to limit you - I am a firm believer that when we peg hole educational options we limit students and education as a whole. Are there bad charter schools? Absolutely. Just like there are bad public schools, bad cops, bad doctors, and bad lawyers. Trust your gut, talk to teachers at the schools you are applying to and you might find yourself somewhere great or you might have one more year of experience when you look for a new job next year.",got first job working part time ate large public wanted work full time found similar position second year ended charter saint paul minnesota starting fifth year agree everyone else pro con found pro total freedom curriculum yes meet state standard testing keep pace teacher math teacher grade level know student charter tend smaller get build real relationship watch student rest plan development encouraged development includes lot training program teacher pick focus year weekly development smaller class size cap way better one public class con teacher union sometimes frustration go unheard administrative level get paid le public teacher like le per year work longer hour peer teaching class planning curriculum creation take time also home visit homeroom student year additional requirement bottom line seems good try gain experience insight teaching setting ruling solely public charter private going limit firm believer peg hole educational option limit student education whole bad charter school absolutely like bad public school bad cop bad doctor bad lawyer trust gut talk teacher school applying might find somewhere great might one year experience look new job next year
highschoolteachers,"I use and love INs in my classroom. I agree with /you/TTUgirl about looking on Pinterest - there are tons of resources - and also take a look at ""lapbooks"" resources, which are basically the same thing. I started using them because I kept feeling like I was drowning in paper, all the time. This way, it was the Ss' responsibility to keep their notebook in good working order and I cut my grading to once a month for the notebooks (essays, tests, etc were extra, but since I was not grading everything else all the time, I had more time for them and gave better feedback). The kids responded really well, even the big high school kids - they loved the foldables and taking notes on the pretty pages, even though it was the same stuff we would have done on a regular page. They always have paper for assignments, and yes, there is a lot of time you can spend cutting and gluing, but you can always have them do that stuff at home.",use love in classroom agree attagirl looking pinterest ton resource also take look logbooks resource basically thing started using kept feeling like drowning paper time way i responsibility keep notebook good working order cut grading month notebook essay test etc extra since grading everything else time time gave better feedback kid responded really well even big kid loved foldable taking note pretty page even though stuff would done regular page always paper assignment yes lot time spend cutting gluing always stuff home
highschoolteachers,"I disagree with a lot of this. I floated my first year and I have my own room now. I teach in a large high school. I do not mind if teachers rearrange my desks as long as they are put back at the end of the block. Make it part of your routine if you like, and I do not think there is any problem with that. It is YOUR class and you should be able to set it up how you like. I would definitely ask a teacher to leave my room while I am teaching. I think it is VERY intrusive to expect to stay. I am sure there is some place in the building that teacher can go to with their things while you are teaching. It is ridiculous to have to have another adult in the room while you are teaching. I would feel out of line staying in my room while another teacher was teaching in it. That is not to say sometimes I forget something and go grab something off my desk, but I would never stay in the whole class. My advice would be to make sure the room is how you left it (this goes for floaters and the classroom holder) and to make sure there are areas of the classroom that are ""yours"" - a shelf, bookcase, whatever it might be, that is off limits to each other. For example, my desk is in my classroom, and I asked the floating teachers not to touch anything on my desk, but ensured that there were other areas of the room available to them. My advice is to talk to the teachers in your room and agree on common areas and private spaces, and to be respectful of organization and cleanliness. My other advice is to store pencils, markers, scrap paper, etc in your area of the room for every day use since you do not want to use a cart (I did not either) and only be responsible for carrying your own personal items (lesson plans, your pens, whatever) and keeping everything accessible. I used binder clips so in case something fell it all still stays together. I also clip pens on my bag so that I can pull it off quickly for when kids come up to have their pass signed or whatever. Keep it as easy for yourself as possible by having as little as possible to tote around with you.

A lot of students who my co-workers thought were impossible really were not that bad for me. I think the kids who are just waiting to be old enough to drop out are not always the worst. Yeah, they do not care. But, after 12 years, I know that I cannot *make* them care, so I do not try. I call home a couple of times. Then mom says, ""Yeah, he is just waiting to be old enough to drop out and I do not care."" Then I say, ""Well, if it does not offend you, I will not fight with him to get him to do work. I do not want to embarrass him by making him argue with me. And, I do not want to demean myself."" Usually, the parents are okay with that. The ones who are the worst are the ones who actively try to be a disruption. I have had kids say, ""I do not care about this class, so I am not going to do anything."" To that, I reply, ""Fine. Just do not be a disruption."" That sometimes works. But, there are kids-usually high school kids who are taking my high school class to just have a full time schedule but do not need the credit-who are just impossible. I had one boy for three years (I teach 7th and 8th grade) who did not do shit in my class. He was retained once. He was often high in my class. He ran his business out of the bathroom.

Now, ask yourself, ""what tool am I teaching using worksheets?"" I suppose you could make a case that in filling out a worksheet the student needs to find the information in the text to answer the questions. Fine, but is that the best use of your time and their energy? Worksheets might have some value, but in my estimation it is marginal. Instead, maybe use that time and energy to help them learn to take notes. Perhaps instead of worksheets, have them keep a neat notebook wick you can check periodically (for a grade preferably, or not). Kids need to learn how to take notes, and then instead of searching their text for information, they can consult their own notebooks, written by their own hand. Take this for what you will.

She can work on it at home or during specific times in class. 3. Have her read books that are more on her level.

highschoolteachers,"I have not taught any of these students myself but I am in a sign language class where we have to read books about deaf culture. This one book is called Deaf Again by Mark...Draulsborough? Something like that. Anyway, it talks about his journey from being a hearing child to a hard of hearing adolescent to a deaf adult. In schools he said he had to be able to see the teacher to lip read. He talked about taking spelling tests where she would walk around the room as she was reciting the words and he would continually hand in blank papers. He often had to ask classmates later for the details on homework assignments because he could not hear the teacher. From what the guy talks about in the book it sounds like giving an outline of the lesson would be helpful so they have an idea of what info they are listening to in case they need to fill in the gaps of what they cannot quite hear. Context can make a difference. Also speak clearly so they can lip read more easily. He was saying that sometimes it is a matter of speaking more clearly, not screaming in his face. He talked about being in very small classes and how amazingly helpful it was to have an aid in the classroom to go explain things to him that he missed hearing so he did not get lost. The aid would pop in throughout the class and help him as soon as he got off track, and he said he did great when that was the environment. When he was pushed to a larger classroom he really struggled trying to do it on his own. Also group discussions could be difficult because so much was going on he could not follow it well enough and lip read every person. These school experiences happened when he was hard of hearing, before the deafness set in. In another book, Intro to Deaf American Culture, they discuss mainstream and deaf schools.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school. In my experience, many of my coworkers will say things like ""student-teacher relationships are important, but not more important than learning."" I agree with this statement to a point. From what I have gathered, students actively look for ways that they can relate to you. The more the students feel like they can trust you and have a positive relationship with you, the less behavioral problems you will have and more students will be willing to speak out in class. I am not saying I would ""be their friends"" but I think having a positive, trusting relationship with my students is vital. It can be tricky to balance the teacher vs. friend dilemma, but it pays off in the classroom having a positive relationship with students. Ask them questions about what they like to do! Talk to the quiet kids just as much! If a student is interested in a certain topic or hobby, I try to incorporate examples from that topic into my class. Most importantly, be enthusiastic about whatever the students are into, you do not have to like the latest video game or what music they listen to, but if the students feel like you listen to them, you will not have many behavioral problems. I made the mistake of being students' friend too much during student teaching. I still got positive reactions from students, but I never felt like a teacher or had much control. I think you just need to find that balance. T.L.D.R.

highschoolteachers,These were also likely older teachers that have been at it for a while and know what they are doing. Younger teachers that are not all that much older than high school students are much easier to be seen as a peer by their students. The teacher-student relationship introduces a completely different power dynamic- it would be like seeing yourself on the same level as your manager at work. Dressing like a teacher is something that goes beyond how students see teachers. It adds a level of professionalism that keeps the rest of society from looking at us like overpaid babysitters/ social workers. These things are said for a reason. Understand that you generally do not get old by being dumb.,also likely older teacher know younger teacher much older student much easier seen peer student teacher student relationship introduces completely different power dynamic would like seeing level manager work dressing like teacher something go beyond student see teacher add level professionalism keep rest society looking u like overpaid babysitter social worker thing said reason understand generally get old dumb
highschoolteachers,"One of the things a co-worker of mine and I had discussed was moving from teaching high school aged students (here between 15-18) to middle school aged students (about 12-14 years old). Now, with other students I found that while you (hopefully) gain intelligence and independence to do more demanding work you lose a bit of respect and authority. Older kids are much more willing (I think) to push their limits with their attitudes. Visa-Versa with younger kids, while they may not challenge your authority as much, you may not be able to do as in depth or demanding of lessons. With that said, at the elementary level I have heard the 'burn out' rate is much higher. Other than your teaching materials/lessons/content and curriculum you need to consider the other factors of a students life. As a teacher (in any age range) you also take on many other roles. In elementary school with younger students it will be more like care-giver, nurturer, and almost parent. They will come to you when they need their shoes tied, or fall down, or are having a fight over a pencil. The problems are small to you but very large to them. They will want things to be fair, if he has it, she can have it to. If they are doing this over there, those kids can do that over there. Accidents, crying, bickering, shouting, etc, all those things are present. With older kids the problems are different, they may not come to you to tie their shoes, but they will come to you when their boyfriend/girlfriend is acting weird, or when they are fighting with their best friend. Maybe there are issues at home they want to discuss, you become much more of a 'councilor.' For me personally the reason I chose secondary over primary was just that, those 'other roles' the teacher has to take on. Most of my family/friends find it odd that I do not want to work with little kids because (in their words) ""you are just so good with little kids. Look at how much they (my nieces, nephew, their friends, little cousins, other children) love you! You are so fun and you just get them."" However, while it is easy for me to deal with 5 maybe 6 small children at one time, working with 20 of them at one time sounds terrrrrrible to me. I do not think I could take the 'petty' issues of ""HE IS TOUCHING ME!"" or ""Why is she LOOKING at me?!"" or ""He took my pencil!"" or ""HE CUT ME IN LINE! I WAS HERE FIRST!"" So consider that my friend, while teaching for primary school may not be as educationally demanding as teaching secondary, it will be mentally demanding and it will still pose it is challenges. My family members give their hats to me for wanting to work with the Jerky-self absorbed-over dramatic-attitude ridden teenagers, but it is THEY (other members of my family work in primary school) that are doing the really hard work and who deserve my full appreciation! Consider that it is they, the primary school teachers, who help shape the students they will become. TL;DR: Both primary and secondary teachers face have challenging careers, sometimes not always with the academic side of their jobs. Younger students will respect your authority more (I AM GOING TO) but older students will allow you to have more in-depth lessons, discussions, and projects. Both age groups require teachers to be MORE than just educators.

highschoolteachers,"I taught high school Composition for college-bound juniors for several years. To make learning how to do an Annotated Bibliography interesting, I turned the assignment into a scavenger hunt. The clues changed from year to year, depending on the resources available to us in the building or the types of citation entries students were struggling with. My goal was for them to know how to cite common sources for research -- books and articles from databases, mainly -- but mixed in with practice for those were things like ""a movie you would not recommend"" or ""the best music album of summer"" and so on. The theme of the Annotated Bibliographies then was loosely based around each student's own interests (rather than the research subject), but it still gave them an opportunity to have a little fun while practicing an important skill. A main struggle with the Annotated Bibliography for my students was the formatting. They never wanted to write more (than maybe 2-3 sentences) in the annotations because getting it in the proper spot underneath the citation was so damn frustrating. They also struggled switching back and forth from reverse indents to regular indents (we used MLA). I think if you make it just the right level of annoying, they should not need help being concise.",taught composition college bound junior several year make learning annotated bibliography interesting turned assignment scavenger hunt clue changed year year depending resource available u building type citation entry student struggling goal know cite common source research book article database mainly mixed practice thing like movie would recommend best music album summer theme annotated bibliography loosely based around student interest rather research subject still gave opportunity little fun practicing important skill main struggle annotated bibliography student formatting never wanted write maybe sentence annotation getting proper spot underneath citation damn frustrating also struggled switching back forth reverse indent regular indent used mla think make right level annoying need help concise

You should highlight the fact that since you know what is expected of high school students, you are uniquely capable of preparing middle school students for high school. However, you should emphasize that you understand how much care middle schoolers need. (Trust me. They are a needy bunch.) Do plenty of research on the district. Find out what grades are actually considered middle school. My middle school only consists of 7th and 8th grades. However, I have taught at another middle school that was 5-8. They will probably have teams of teachers-a group of 4 teachers who work together to teach all of the subjects to the same group of students. If the teams work together well, it is a really great situation. Ask about how their teams work. Also, depending on what your you will be teaching, you will get students with different ability levels. A 6th grader is very different from an 8th grader.

highschoolteachers,"Big things to know: 1. Behavior management in middle school is completely different than high school. Some issues that are widespread in high schools are present, but rarer (violence, pregnancies, drugs, gangs), while others that are also present in high school are magnified (bullying, habitual dishonesty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, externalized responsibility). Expect a question about strategies with dealing with student bullying, student conflict, or a student in emotional crisis. 2. Because of that, behavior management is more of a focus in classrooms. The value of rules, procedures, consequences, and rewards are far more significant, because of the fact that students need more structure. Expect a question on your classroom rules and procedures--and definitely do not message yourself as a ""I am a relatively relaxed teacher""-type--those tend not to work well in middle school environments. 3. Added to that, instructional planning needs to more urgently address those ""why"" questions: ""why are we learning this?"" ""why does it matter?"" In middle school, there is less of a built-in ""why"" to their daily attendance in school: in high school, the majority of students see themselves on their way to graduation, and they want to achieve that, whereas in middle school, high school graduation feels decades away. Added to that, middle school students are developmentally more incapable than high school students of understanding because/effect relationships when it comes to their actions, so they rarely see how their daily choices affect long-term outcomes. Lesson planning and classroom structures need to address that. Any answers you can give in your interview about goals or motivators that you hope to incorporate into your classroom will be good. 4. Teaching middle school can be especially exciting considering that many educators consider middle school to be a major turning point when it comes to students' attitudes towards and choices relating to their education. Most middle schools prioritize developing students' character, and teachers are in a position of creating good student habits and attitudes, as well as instructing. It might the worth asking, ""What are the traits and skills of the [school name] student?"" in your interview, because that will give you a sense of what kind of character-building your principal wants to take place.

I will almost always say yes to a student who asks me about late work within a day or two of a due date, but beyond that, I feel take advantage of. I think my issue with the policy my department is suggesting is that they want no penalty at all. In the real world, you might be late, but there is a consequence for doing so. Maybe you get written up or passed up for a promotion or your boss is just pissed, but there IS a consequence. And in college, there is rarely leeway for worked that simple is not turned in without an adequate excuse.

highschoolteachers,"I am a high school math teacher. I usually only have two types of assignments: daily homework, checked for completion and worth four points, and then chapter reviews, a blend of completion and accuracy, worth fifty points. For daily homework, I give students the full credit if it is turned in on time. I give three points if it is turned in before first period the next day (The rationale being: hey, it is late, but the student made it a priority). Two points if it is turned in during class the next day. I do not offer half credit or accept assignments after one day late. If homework is a consistent issue, I have offered students a 'makeup packet', which consists of useful assignments, one page per homework that they want to make up, which I give them one week to do for half credit on missed assignments. The only caveat for this is that in order to get this opportunity, the parent/guardian and I are in contact about this and the student has to either call them or have a conference with them and explain why the missing homework has been such an issue (granted, I teach in a district where parent/teacher relations are pretty standard, but I think this keeps this assignment option as more of a hassle for most students). Chapter reviews I am a bit more strict on. They are given to students about three days before a test and are due the day of the test. Because I typically use it as a study guide, I post answers on Blackboard the night before the test. This has caused a lot of issue for me when students do not turn it in. I am sure that this is not the ideal method, but I only accept it late up to a week after the test date, and I do not give a penalty. I assume that the students use this as a study review -- if they do well on a test, I know that they understand how to do the material, and if they test poorly, it gives them a chance to get points in a less-stressful environment. I have debated between accepting it late or not because the answers are available, but what I have found is that typically students who are turning it in late and do not care about the material are typically are not the ones who bother getting online to copy the answers.

highschoolteachers,"I would not advise getting your masters right away...you can price yourself out of a job in a lot of districts (beginning teachers are always a bit of a risk, and having a matters with no experience makes the financial investment significantly higher). If you are limited in which districts you will apply to, go to the admin or hr directly and talk it through with them, as they may prefer that you have an MA. If your options are wide open, I would hold off until you have a couple of years in the classroom. The first couple of years of teaching is all about learning what actually works in a classroom, not what should theoretically happen as you learn in many colleges. A masters program will be more valuable after you have started teaching, in my belief. Plus some districts will pay for it, or at least help. You can, however, make yourself more marketable by doing a lot of tutoring and volunteering in classrooms. Get as much technology in education training as you can, with certifications or any kind of formal achievements. also, get certified to teach AP.

highschoolteachers,"Absolutely agree. As educators of students who may or may not have supportive families to guide them in character education, it might have to fall on us to guide their moral/ethical development. Calling out stupid actions as such is very important in that development. Caveats: 1. This is different than the KIPP's standardized education model. I do not think character can be reduced to mere numerical factors. That bastardizes character development's goal and changes it from developing intrinsic characteristics to getting higher numbers. 2. Successful people internalize failure and misdeeds very differently than unsuccessful people. Some of my lower performing students do not have the moral development/maturity yet to internalize failure productively, and as such become disengaged from school. This is why we cannot coddle them, but also need to provide them the social and emotional tools to deal with failure. 3. Moral/character development also burdens us with reflection on our biases and prejudices when it comes to value judgment. For example, I understand that growing up in the US I have a decidely capitalist-utilitarian bent to value calculus, and as such I need to interrogate the roots of my assumptions when it comes to determining what is good and bad.

highschoolteachers,"One of the best things would be that experienced teachers be the majority of the school board. Democracy has been a disaster for school boards. Elected politicians may decide the budget allotment but not how it is used. Also, enforce pyramid spending in districts. The majority of the money needs to go to the classroom directly. When I worked in the US, the money would be allotted to districts but disappeared at the administrative level. We should move away from high-stakes testing. Standardized testing is not bad. It does allow me to see how my students progressed through the year in one facet of their education. It should not be attached to school funding, salaries, or bragging rights.

highschoolteachers,"I disagree with the first comment - I think you should stick at it and get the NQT. That does not mean I think you should stick at the same school, though... Reasons: 1) Once you do, you are qualified for life and can always go back later. If you do not, you would have to do the entire year again. I would say six months extra is worth that option being in your life, especially at your age. 2) I do not think, personally, that your degree course was the best way to do it (I did my PGCE at Imperial too but only after a four-year masters and three year PhD study), and I do not think either that putting you as the sole physicist in a large high school was a good way to start that career. Your observations and experience of teaching are tainted by this - that does not invalidate them, it is just that there is definitely another view to be had. 3) The NQT year is harder than the others. It gets easier when you do not have paperwork to fill in and observations to do and resources to make every damn day, etc, and as you become more secure in your subject knowledge you teach better lessons. You can enjoy it more. 4) ""Which means I pretty much have to stay until at least Christmas, and if I am staying until Christmas I may as well stay the full year."" Rubbish. Get out of the (what sounds like an) awful school as soon as possible. Get to a good school where you are trained effectively and supported properly. 5) ""It looks bad on my CV to only stay for a year in a school.

highschoolteachers,"I am a foreign language teacher that used to work at a high school that required us to turn in daily lesson plans to our admin supervisor. So I had to learn how to write plans effectively or salve all weekend in them since at one point I had four preps (20 plans a week, kill me). Anyways, use routines. Write a really good routine in the first 20-25% of your class that helps the kids practice skills. I had a rotating routine of questioning and answering (speaking and listening) that I put in the beginning of each class but you can do reading exercises or writing prompts, whatever suits your goals. I spent hours thinking this through and plotting it out and then just copy and pasted the framework in my weekly lesson plans with new questions and small assessments updated for each week. Therefore the bulk of your work is built in and you just worry about the questioning parts. On top of that I had a lecture framework I used (listed how I would lecture and would break down the content: teacher led, whole class practice, check for understanding, questions) and kept a word doc of all the different activities I could implement afterwards for kids to practice skills independently. You spend a lot of time building your lesson plan repertoire but as long as you work smart, stay consistent and save all the individual portions of your plans, it is fine. My admin loved my lesson plans and I even won a lame little award for them. So as long as you could justify why you are adding the parts you are adding, you will be fine.

highschoolteachers,"Sticky situation, for sure. I played football in high school, and one of the positions I played was on kickoff. That meant we kicked the ball, someone on their team caught it, and we sprint straight at them while the ball is in the air with every intention of flattening whomever caught the ball. This is the most dangerous part of the game, as you might know/realize. I was the fastest kid on our side by a large margin. I usually missed the tackles because I was running so fast, I could not change direction when I got up to the other team, so I would blow right past them. Not this time, though. This time, I was lined pin straight with the guy who caught the ball and there was nothing anyone could do to change what happened next. As I look at him, I realize he is just standing there, eyes wide like a deer in headlights, and knees bent, but completely paralyzed. At that point there was nothing I could do, I was already jumping to make the tackle; it was not my fault he did nothing to protect himself. I did not even bother wrapping my arms around him to take him down. I just threw my shoulder into his chest, knowing that would be way more than enough to get him to the ground. The sound of our pads colliding was so disturbing that both side lines and everyone in the stands went completely quiet. I honestly felt pretty good about it. Getting a chance to completely bury someone like that is an accomplishment on the field. I get a bunch of high fives and helmet slaps from my team for making a big hit, and then I look over as the coach is helping the kid take his helmet off. Then I realize something was not right. I thought I concussed him because he looked funny, so I started walking over to check on him, but the ref stopped me and sent me back to my side. Later on I found out he had down syndrome and they only let him on the field because the game was pretty much over and kind of a blowout. Words cannot describe how mortified I was. There was a crushing guilt, but I eventually realized it was not really my fault. Was infuriated me was that the coaching staff would let this kid play that position... It is like letting children play in traffic. I was so disgusted that I quit that week and never played football again, which I regretted tremendously later on in life. Football is a dangerous game for kids with average cognitive abilities. Letting a kid with a cognitive disability play is just immoral. It might be crushing to him, but there are plenty of other sports out there.

As for the schedule, you will probably be working most weekends for your first few years anyways.

Answering that question might help you to figure out if you have what it takes. Was it just because it was at a middle school? Because in my program, we had to do a placement at middle school and high school. So you will probably have to get through another middle school placement.

highschoolteachers,"Your average, sensible adult/ teacher is not straight-up seeking out gays and asking them to ""hide"".

My circle of teenage and adult friends were much the same.

highschoolteachers,"I am a third year high school math teacher. This is primarily my experience and I work in a high needs low income school because I wanted to. I work in a brand new charter schools, 200 students, grade 9-10. Primarily Hispanics. Stress: you will be overloaded with stress for the first year or two. In my case, it was adjusting to an actual career and organizing/recreating lessons. One thing you have to learn is to borrow from other teachers. Never ever create something from scratch. Google the hell out of everything and combine as you please. For my curriculum, I was happy to use Mathematics Vision Project to teach integrated math 1-3. Workload: having the curriculum already made, the workload was not difficult after the first year of playing around with the lessons in the curriculum. My second and now third year are such a breeze. I do not lesson plan after work and I only plan during my prep, that includes grading exams and professional support. Pay: I get paid a lot for how long I have been in teaching. I work in southern San Diego (near the border) and my salary is in the upper 50k. I have free BTSA (this clears your credential) and fully paid for professional development from my school. If you were to calculate the amount of days I work compared to my mechanical engineering friends or software developer friends, I work less than them, have less work days, have full benefits, and more vacation time than them. Yes they make more than I do, but factoring the time they work compared to me, it is actually pretty similar. Most of my friends earn 80-120k but work almost every single day and do not get much vacation. If you were to make my teaching schedule like their work schedule, salary would be similar. So I am not complaining. Conclusion: there are a lot of people who will say that teaching is stressful, that you will lesson plan after you finish work, that you will go above and beyond for your students, that you will have no life for the first few years. I disagree with those statements. You will find that you like some students and dislike others. It is okay. Some students are complete assholes. I documented everything from minor infractions to complete disrespect. Then I called for a parent teacher conference or went for a home visit with all my evidence. I fucked up a lot of parents' image of their ""angel"" of a son or daughter. But it felt good. 1) teaching is stressful, but so is any serious career you pursue. I find my stress healthy. 2) I never lesson planned outside of my work hours unless I had nothing else to do (which happened quite a bit). 3) going above and beyond is not an expectation for many schools. If your school decides how good of a teacher you are by test scores, then you need to reconsider your school site. Performance does show skill of the teacher, but it is not everything. 4) I have seen a lot of my teacher friends vanish from the world because they are consumed by their work. That is unhealthy. They focus so much on their work that they get burnt out. I have learned from my apprentice years that work will be there regardless of how much you do before or after work. Teaching is an amazing career and passion. I love it and I would have never dreamed about leaving. It really is up to you and how well your teaching program prepared you. A lot, and I do mean a lot of the teaching programs out there are a complete joke, and that is why you get a lot of teachers who cannot handle the workload because the program never taught them how to do it.

highschoolteachers,"I also do not want it to be easy to retake a test, but I want students who genuinely have a need for it for whatever reason to be able to do so. It is less about more students taking advantage of the policy (I do not want to grade 150 exams once and then grade them all again) and more about giving students who were just having a totally off day for whatever reason (they got the worst night's sleep ever the night before, their dog died, they had to work instead of studying) a chance for it to not send their grade into the gutter. So for me to even bother giving a retake, they need to show me that they have done some things to be prepared. It is wasting their own time and mine to give a retake if the student is going to do the same level of work. In the past I have sometimes done things like giving an optional study guide and offering bonus points on the test if they do the study guide, but participation in that has been pretty dismal amongst the students who actually need it (which will also be the case with the test retakes, but at least in that instance I know that if parents get upset about grades I can say that I have a retake policy their child chose not to take advantage of). I know in principle I prefer the idea of a student taking a whole new test to doing corrections on one that is already been graded. I teach a couple sections of freshmen and a couple of sections of a relatively low-achieving physical science course along with a couple of upperclassmen courses. I want a policy that I stick to for all my classes, but I want it to have room for my freshmen, who are maybe still getting used to high school level classes, to improve their test grades if necessary.

highschoolteachers,"Some names definitely roll off the tongue nicer without a Mr. or Ms. at the beginning. My physics teacher shared a classroom with another one, and the teacher who was not on duty would acknowledge as much so we started doing it too. Come to think of it, except the teachers we were scared of (or respected so deeply that it amounted to the same thing), we all called our high school teachers by just their last name or even their first name by junior/senior year. Definitely a culture thing, so I know as a teacher I would probably stick to ""Mr./Ms. Soandso"" when students are around, and first names if we were friendly. (And since I work with ELL's, that is a whole bunch of culture clash so better to err on the side of politeness.) At my college we generally call professors by their first names outside of class or just their last names, depending on department. If a professor is pushy about being called ""Doctor"" we usually call them ""Dr. So and so,"" but most do not care. I work in my major's department, so I cannot ever go back to using their last names unless I am talking about them to somebody who has no clue who they are.

I was a hard working, focused, motivated, and respectful kid and I had students skipping my class, disregarding rules, and refusing to do work. But as a student teacher you have to fight so much harder for respect- the real world and having a class of your own is SO different. You just have to take what is in front of you and be flexible.

highschoolteachers,"My first year, I had ""that kid"". He was not awful, but he would not. shut. his. mouth. *EVER*. It was so frustrating. If I refused to speak over him, I could barely get through a sentence. If I reprimanded him, he would be quiet for about 2 minutes. He would talk to anyone who was sitting next to him, no matter where he sat. If I put him at an isolated seat, he talked to himself. If I pulled him aside to talk to him, he would ""Yes"" me, then go right back to his behavior afterwards. Now, this was my first year, and I started mid-year, so by the time I realized it was a problem, I felt like there was so little left of the year that I just wanted it to end. I imagine I would handle him differently, now. Or at least escalate faster, and call home to see if that helped. But, in the 4 school years since then, I have not had another one like that. I mean, sure, my kids are not all perfect angels, but for the most part they are really good. Then again, I did have one class period last year that I liken to watching a room full of puppies. Bouncing off the walls energetic. Well-intentioned, but mischievous. The just wanted your love and attention, but the moment you were not focused on them (because there were 20 other puppies in the room), they would pee in the corner. LOL. Not literally, of course. But they did break TWO expensive pieces of lab equipment because they were, quite literally, acting thoughtlessly. I always have a kid or two each year that simply will not take class seriously, or put in more than the barest minimum of effort. But they are generally not disruptive to others, only themselves. Edit: I cannot believe I forgot the follow-up story to ""that kid""! The next year, he came back and asked me to write him a college recommendation letter! I told him he should find someone else, because his behavior in my class did not warrant a recommendation. He came back and insisted that since I was his science teacher, I needed to write one. I refused again. He insisted a third time. I agreed. Well... my exact response was, ""If you need a letter, I will write one, but I am not sure what you think I am going to say in it. You should ask someone else, someone you showed more respect to, but I will submit a letter if you insist."" So, *then*, I decided I would ask him a few questions to see if there was actually even a glimmer of something to write about. *What do you want to go to school for?* ""Electrical engineering. That is why I need you to write the letter. It looks good if a science teacher writes it."" *Okay... So, why do you want to study that?* ""My dad says it is a good job."" *That is it?* ""Yeah."" *Okay, then... so, what else have you done in high school? Any clubs?* ""Golf team for 4 years."" *Great!

I was always one of those ""helpful"" students, both in my days in public school and in college, where I would often act as an unofficial TA for some of my professors; one even had me teach a couple of classes because I knew the program better than him! I worked a lot of random jobs during and after college, and have two degrees in film/video (which only adds to the amount of random jobs, just within that industry alone). I ended up unemployed for a good while (no local films being done) and a friend of mine who worked at a local school district suggested I apply for a teachers aide position. I did, got the job, and worked with middle school and pre-K students. A year later I planned to move to upstate NY, and when preparing to do so it was suggested I look into a Children's Center in Rochester; got the job there, working with severe special needs students. Family health issues (my father) had me go back to my hometown, and after a few jobs within the course of the first year, I went back to the district and applied again, this time being assigned a position with the SDC English classes at the local high school, which is where I have worked since for the last several years. As those years went on, it became apparent to the teacher I work with, the administration, the counselors...everyone...that I had a knack for teaching. Not just in English, but in any classroom I happened to be in. Through them (and family and friends) encouraging me, I looked into steps toward getting my credentials. 10 years after getting by Bachelors, I am now about to start my student teaching phase of getting my credentials, and I am both intimidated and excited about the possibilities the future holds.

highschoolteachers,"I think that is going to depend on each person,honestly. Each is going to have defenses, habits, capabilities, and struggles. Kudos to you for reaching out to them and having the heart to sustain meaningful connection. I am a parapro halfway through my fourth year at a high school in a program for at risk, and various things on their plate that make school difficult. Like I said, each student responds differently,but I can jot down some general tidbits that have been helpful for me to keep in mind as I have worked. One thing that I think can be underestimated is just the sheer fact of providing normal, what a gift! From day one, telling them what to expect, and following through on it, no exceptions. One might think making flexible adjustments is more intuitive and helpful with this population but I have found that on the contrary, it teaches them you do not mean what you say and they do not have to put in the work unless they feel like it because you are going to bend over backwards to pick up the pieces. That is in fact a disservice. I think creating a space in their lives where there is limited ambiguity, rules and expectations with accountability tells them that what they do matters, facilitates an atmosphere where because they know what to expect, they are more likely to put their guard down. This is not warm and fuzzy and on the front end involves being exhaustively accused and perceived as some strict bitch with a stick up her ass ( how dare she tell me to stop rolling my eyes, how dare she tell me to get off my phone, how dare she tell me to get some work out). However, without fail, this has nearly one hundred percent resulted in relationships where I am respected, or at least the expectations are. I have had notoriously angry broken hurting students fight me tooth and nail about those kinds of habits, only later to set my heart in song by calmly shaking their heads half smiling, ""coaching"" other students in the room ""dude, stop arguing, she is going to take your headphones away"" or ""bro, she is just going to send you to the office if you keep talking like that"". I do not think there can be a greater gift for these people who have had their lives hunkered down in the panic of uncertainty to have a place where rules are understood, that protect them, and are consistent. Children need to be told no, that keeps them safe, teaches boundaries. Oftentimes the teens in these situations have not been taught that or have had things enforced with abuse of power at their expense. Modeling a structure and routine for them is a gift. I think this is the best thing that can be done for them, regardless of whatever other materials are covered. Because this is how trust and respect is bred. Those confrontations are no piece of cake, but they can also be a chance to model disagreement and discipline without abuse, threat, and shouting. I always start by calmly affirming they have the right to believe or feel whatever it is they are expressing but that there are expectations for how to communicate respectfully, by choosing the right time, place and words. Failing any one of those invites consequences. How we do business is just as important as the business itself. As for getting work done beyond the behavioral management piece, first, emphasize the habits and not the material when they are sitting glaring at you in study hall wondering why they have to do a page of math homework or an essay or whatever. Instead of the abstract rabbit hole of trying to predict what information might later be applicable, I just cut to the chase and affirm they would rather be doing something else, that it is confusing, but practicing doing things you do not want to do but have to do is so important for being a hard worker and later getting a job. Draw from other areas of their lives, like sports or activities that are demanding. Encourage them as people who are able to work through difficult things, that they can put effort into this and develop habits that will maybe make school more manageable but also for sure make them stronger adults.",think going depend person honestly going defense habit capability struggle kudos reaching heart sustain meaningful connection parapet halfway fourth year program risk various thing plate make difficult like said student responds differently jot general tidbit helpful keep mind worked one thing think underestimated sheer fact providing normal gift day one telling expect following exception one might think making flexible adjustment intuitive helpful population found contrary teach mean say put work unless feel like going bend backwards pick piece fact disservice think creating space life limited ambiguity rule expectation accountability tell matter facilitates atmosphere know expect likely put guard warm fuzzy front end involves exhaustively accused perceived strict bitch stick as dare tell stop rolling eye dare tell get phone dare tell get work however without fail nearly one hundred percent resulted relationship respected least expectation notoriously angry broken hurting student fight tooth nail kind habit later set heart song calmly shaking head half smiling coaching student room dude stop arguing going take headphone away bro going send office keep talking like think greater gift people life hunkered panic uncertainty place rule understood protect consistent child need told keep safe teach boundary oftentimes teen situation taught thing enforced abuse power expense modeling structure routine gift think best thing done regardless whatever material covered trust respect bred confrontation piece cake also chance model disagreement discipline without abuse threat shouting always start calmly affirming right believe feel whatever expressing expectation communicate respectfully choosing right time place word failing one invite consequence business important business getting work done beyond behavioral management piece first emphasize habit material sitting glaring study hall wondering page math homework essay whatever instead abstract rabbit hole trying predict information might later applicable cut chase affirm would rather something else confusing practicing thing want important hard worker later getting job draw area life like sport activity demanding encourage people able work difficult thing put effort develop habit maybe make manageable also sure make stronger adult
highschoolteachers,"I would think it depends on where you are teaching and what the requirements are for middle school. Some states/districts, such as mine, require that sixth grade ELA students have a 2-period block of language arts, then 1 hour thereafter (7-12). For me, I feel this makes my position easier than that of someone teaching high school - 1/2 as many students per day = 1/2 as many papers to grade/assessments to give. I have only got two LA blocks per day, along with 1 elective, so...94 students per day vs. (potentially) 145 per day. While I do have few students, there is still plenty to read/evaluate. Especially when we hit our argumentative unit in the beginning of the year, when the kids each choose a topic to research and write a persuasive/argumentative paper. Over three months they are taught research techniques, opinion vs. fact, MLA formatting (because our district likes it that way), and rewriting skills. So, I will be reading 64 3-4 page research papers come March, then again when they do rewrites for better grades. (No four-page papers? Who told you that lie?) In terms of workload - it all depends on how you choose to present the information and what you choose to grade (remember - you are the teacher. You do not have to grade everything). I do a log of projects, both group and individual, which saves a lot of time on the back end (grading while they work, etc). If you can conform your units and lesson plans to work in your favor then you have already won. Parenting - well the wife and I are parents of four. Only one was an infant when I began teaching, the others were already in grade/middle/high school. However, my wife also worked - albeit part time - so we also had to work around that. Yes, it is tough being away from the bambinos during the day. Can you get some familial assistance with the kiddo? Perhaps a trusted neighbor or friend who would be willing to step in for an hour/two after school while you stick around? Even a day or two/week could give you that needed breathing room. Sounds to me like you have got some chops already and are confident in your abilities.

I know it is a busy time of the year with holidays, but you might be able to schedule a time to meet him or her for lunch and ask questions about the school and the students you will have. If you want the students to use specific skills when watching films, you can practice them in the first few days with short films (look at shortfilmoftheweek.com for some that you could use after screening them) or with TED Talks. I used ""The Karman Line"" in my class. (It has a brief moment in which you can see a man's butt, and I just blacked out the screen using the a/v mute button on my smartboard moment). ""This Is Normal"" is also good. In general, it is good to introduce solid procedures and practice them consistently from the first day, whether those are things like how students can ask to use the bathroom, where/how they turn in their work, or what skills they need to practice in your class.

highschoolteachers,"1. How old are your students? 2. What do you teach? 3. How much autonomy do you have in the classroom? As an ESL teacher who works with high school students (and has worked with middle school in the past) and who has dealt with personality conflicts among my students, I almost always prefer to organize desks into tables and divide students into small groups of four or so. Six is my preferred maximum. Each student had a desk name tag which I placed at their assigned seat before class began. I then adopted a task-based approach to classroom learning, so that each group has a task to accomplish within a preset time limit during class. (This is easier when you use some flipped classroom methods.) There is always a motivation for completing the task correctly during your time limit. I also randomly shuffled groups so that everyone was forced to work with different people every week. If and when they protested, we discussed that in adult life they would sometimes have to work with people they did not get along that well with, and then we discussed strategies for compromise and conflict resolution. I had to be super hands-on with them all the time and it got exhausting, and it did not work 100% of the time, but I did see improvements. For my middle-schoolers I also adopted a rule that for every mean, insulting, or rude thing that came out of your mouth, you had to say something nice. ""You have very organized freckles,"" was one memorable one. My mantra was, ""You do not have to like your classmates, but you do have to be polite to them."" Also, ""You do not have to say nice things, but you may not say mean things."" Eventually they began to get it and the classroom environment became much more civil. For your students with interpersonal conflicts, I would take a quick moment to address it with the two of them and try to help them resolve it if you have the time to do so while other students are engaged in a task. If that is not feasible, perhaps one of them could ask another student to switch seats? But it should not be without your supervision/permission.",old student teach much autonomy classroom esl teacher work student worked past dealt personality conflict among student almost always prefer organize desk table divide student small group four six preferred maximum student desk name tag placed assigned seat class began adopted task based approach classroom learning group task accomplish within preset time limit class easier use flipped classroom method always motivation completing task correctly time limit also randomly shuffled group everyone forced work different people every week protested discussed adult life would sometimes work people get along well discussed strategy compromise conflict resolution super hand time got exhausting work time see improvement schoolers also adopted rule every mean insulting rude thing came mouth say something nice organized freckle one memorable one mantra like classmate polite also say nice thing may say mean thing eventually began get classroom environment became much civil student interpersonal conflict would take quick moment address two try help resolve time student engaged task feasible perhaps one could ask another student switch seat without supervision permission
highschoolteachers,"Well, I can definitely say you are not alone. That is exactly what happened to me in bio, chemistry and physics - the kids that do not have the academic skills to get it on their own will prefer to give up. I do not know if it is a generational thing or not. Some people have suggested gameifying it when possible. I think there might also be an element of ego preservation - they would prefer not to feel stupid so they justify giving up as their way of blaming you or the subject for their lack of performance. I have also noticed that MANY kids come in with fixed concepts of intelligence - you are either smart or stupid. They are hyper-aware of their own feelings to the exclusion of the things that will help them grow. For example, one of my classes has a strong split between independent achievers and struggling high-needs kids. The independent kids love to ask next-level questions, which I will answer briefly, but I usually deflect them to coming in at lunch for a more detailed answer on their own level (they are usually asking things about quantum mechanics - this is a biology class). What the struggling kids take away from this brief exchange is not ""that was a 30 second comment in a 1 hour class"", or ""that kid sounds like he knows what he is talking about"" or ""I want to be able to ask questions like that too"". No, what they have told me is, ""all we do is sit while that kid brags about how smart he is"". What frustrates me the most is that these things have been embedded since at least middle school and they get sent to high school without coping skills ingrained.",well definitely say alone exactly happened bio chemistry physic kid academic skill get prefer give know generational thing people suggested gameifying possible think might also element ego preservation would prefer feel stupid justify giving way blaming subject lack performance also noticed many kid come fixed concept intelligence either smart stupid hyper aware feeling exclusion thing help grow example one class strong split independent achiever struggling need kid independent kid love ask next level question answer briefly usually deflect coming lunch detailed answer level usually asking thing quantum mechanic biology class struggling kid take away brief exchange second comment hour class kid sound like know talking want able ask question like told sit kid brag smart frustrates thing embedded since least get sent without coping skill ingrained

highschoolteachers,"First off, I cannot even imagine how hard it must be for you, teaching, with an infant at home. I really do not know how teachers do it, and if I even decide to have kids, I do not think I would even be able to CONSIDER it without the reality of leaving teaching for at least the first year or two. That said, I moved from MS to high school. A lot depends on the school, but I think high school is much easier overall. Yes, the grading can be cumbersome and intense, but the kids are also more independent, and they need less hand-holding than middle-schoolers. Grades also MATTER in high school, unlike in middle school, where kids get promoted regardless of if they pass or fail a class, and usually based on test scores. I would recommend reevaluating your grading system or assigning fewer, but more meaningful assignments. Perhaps hire a student helper to grade some items for you (homework or multiple-choice items.) Also, do not be afraid to grade for completion when you can. I do this with some assignments, especially written responses, classwork and homework. Essay grading will always take some time, but perhaps you can assign an essay, have the students peer grade each others essays, and then just look over the work to make sure their grade is accurate? You can also do this, by crossing out the names of students, and assigning each a number, so that students do not know whose essay they are assessing. Something else you might consider is the added stress of changing schools and grade levels, while also parenting. I feel like it takes at least a full school year to get the hang of a new school, and while I am much happier teaching HS than I was at the middle school level, I am also having to re-build my curriculum resources from scratch, instead of using things I used last year, which is also time-consuming.

highschoolteachers,"Well as a middle school teacher with 3 preps, I guess my input may not be accurate if the middle school teachers in your district have 1 prep. Either way, middle school is exhausting. Unless you are TOUGH AS NAILS, you need to be on top of them 100% of the time. It is not like high school where you can trust them to do independent work, and go check your email. You really need to be observing what they are doing all of the time. It is definitely way more difficult in terms of classroom management, but easier in terms of planning because you are really teaching skills more than you are teaching content. If you are tired from parenting, I would expect that HS would be easier, because middle school kids make me extremely tired. I have taught every grade of MS, and each one is difficult in its own way. I enjoy teaching them because they are at the verge of self awareness, but they have very little self control. I am thinking of moving to HS because I am too tired from MS.

highschoolteachers,"I made the switch from HS to MS, but it was after only one year teaching HS. I have been teaching middle school for nine years now. One thing to keep in mind is that in HS, there are multiple paths for students, including advanced and remedial classes. If you are thinking of a middle school that does not do this (as I am guessing from the reference to one prep), keep in mind that you may very well see that full range of ability in one classroom. On paper, it is one prep, but if you are differentiating for the multiple levels within the class, the planning could be fairly similar in terms of effort. Plus, middle school kids often need more variety in lesson structure and activity type to maintain interest. That said, the essays do make a big difference. When I taught high school, I felt like I was constantly either grading essays or about to collect another round. In middle school, I can get their work back to them pretty quickly.",made switch i i one year teaching i teaching nine year one thing keep mind i multiple path student including advanced remedial class thinking guessing reference one prep keep mind may well see full range ability one classroom paper one prep differentiating multiple level within class planning could fairly similar term effort plus kid often need variety lesson structure activity type maintain interest said essay make big difference taught felt like constantly either grading essay collect another round get work back pretty quickly
highschoolteachers,"Okay, I want to say up front that if your only reason for switching is because you think it is easier, DO NOT. To address your comments: though the length of writing assignments might be shorter, I would say middle school ELA has the kids writing more frequently. Now, assessing each piece is not something I do, but I do try to read a lot of what they write. Next, not saying that you are doing this necessarily, but I hate it when people assume middle school is ""easier"" than high school because, honestly, teaching middle school well is very hard to do. As far as management goes, it is a whole different ball game for middle school. They are little adults one day and kindergarteners the next. In short, I would not make this switch with the assumption that it will be easier.

highschoolteachers,"Let them know from the very start that they MUST attend every session, unless they have a very, very good reason for missing class (i.e. NOT a GP/dentist appointment). There will inevitably be absences though, so contact the learners after every single absence. This takes forever because sometimes they do not answer their phones so you have to send messages across the college intranet, but then they do not read those either so you have to send an email. Then give them a grace period of 3 days to respond. After three days, take it further - see what disciplinary actions are available to you. Our college has compulsory catch-up classes for low attendance students as a warning, then an intervention meeting with someone from the management as a final warning. If their attendance does not improve after that (usually three consecutive weeks is the limit), then whoosh~ they are off the register. As for late work, this is harder to track because the learners could be attending every session. You have to keep addressing them on their own, face to face and over email to confirm (so then you have a written record of the deadline). Most assignments will be automatically capped at the lowest possible pass mark when they are handed in late or incomplete, which acts as a deterrent, but sometimes some students can still succeed in the progression paths they chose even with the lowest mark. So, they need to be pestered about it like you are a debt collector. I currently have three students (out of about 120, so not so bad!) who are completing four assignments each over the two-week holiday break. Is it difficult? Of course it is. It is bloody stressful for them. But, these assignments are seven weeks late. They can deal with that crap themselves, I do not care. They brought it onto themselves. Obviously do not say that in an interview, though...! Your students need to understand the importance of time management, and they need to understand how to take responsibility for themselves and their own learning. It definitely is not high school where you can give them so much more support and basically spoonfeed them the answers; they MUST do the assignments completely from scratch independently. So your focus is on cultivating independence and responsibility. Which is difficult. A lot of students will hate you at first when you keep not answering every question they ask, but they will eventually get the hang of it and start answering their own questions.

She is subbed pretty much everything - she majored in consumer sciences, so she started off in sewing and knitting, but usually ends up in English and history classes. I distinctly remember learning about the dust bowl in my Modern American History class, but before we started our work she talked to us for a few minutes about being a preacher's daughter in Kansas during that time and taking in folks who would ride the rails to escape the dust, just giving them a hot meal and a place to stay for the night in return for some work. Every student in the class hung on to every word she said and we could not get over how amazing it was to meet somebody who had actually lived through that time.

highschoolteachers,"How cool! I can imagine that elementary students would LOVE this lesson, especially seeing and petting a real one. It sounds like you are passionate, and enjoy teaching! It also sounds like you have got quite a ""lesson plan"" there - maybe a teaching career is in your future! Disclaimer: I am still in college. But, I like to think I know a thing or two. Legally, the only thing I can personally think of would be bringing a chicken in - some schools might not allow it due to allergies. That will depend on the school (and they will tell you). I do not think there will be an issue with you being homeschooled - the school will check you in at the front office as a volunteer or visitor, most likely, and that will be that. For teaching, I would just be sure to keep your audience in mind. Your students will likely not know anything about the subject, so be thorough and explain EVERYTHING. Also be sure to engage your students and include them in some of the discussion (""how does this chicken look different than this one?"" And then discuss the difference in breed and personality). As far as advertising goes, I would probably stay away from traditional advertising in newspapers and such. Seems a little sketchy, and probably indirect. I would suggest emailing an elementary school principal or two near you, asking about it. No doubt they would absolutely love a high school student to come and do this. Many times, in public school, they have high schoolers come and be ""buddies"" with the elementary schoolers and act as mentors, so this situation will not be too unfamiliar. I would suggest only contacting one or two, as I would imagine they would be pretty likely to take you up on it and you do not want to risk overcrowding your schedule. I am sure the principal will ask once they ""book"" you, so to say, but if they do not, be SURE to include a ""game plan"" for what will happen.

highschoolteachers,"I work in further education, but I got the job without an interview. However, I know what is expected from me and what my management expects me to do, so hopefully it will be useful to you to know too. Warning: this is going to be a LONG post! One of the biggest (and probably most ignored) obstacles to overcome is to avoid patronising learners, especially with giving feedback. Most of them are adults and they can see through false praise easily so you have to be extra careful with your wording of your feedback to be positive, but setting appropriate targets in a friendly yet normal tone of voice, almost like you are talking to a coworker... But be careful to not completely tear down that teacher-student boundary. After saying 'do not be patronising', I am going to add, 'but that does not include stickers.' Eeeeeeveryone loves stickers, this is a fact. Smelly stickers that smell like jelly beans and Coca Cola - even better. Stickers, SMARTboard games, Kahoot, flashcards, board games... all that stuff from primary school that gets abandoned in a lot of subjects in high school is all good motivational stuff, so it is good to mention how you intend to motivate learners. Especially when a lot of them will be quite insecure from being out of education for years. Another big obstacle is how to deal with behavioural issues. Even in voluntary subjects where the adult learner is free to get the HELL out of your face, they still remain and act like they are thirty-something year old mothers in a supermarket (""I want to speak to the manager!!""). Suspensions are rare, exclusions even more so. Telling a learner to stand outside the class does not really work. You kind of have to deal with everything in a conversational way, and pull learners aside for serious chats when required at the end rather than during the class. Nine times out of ten, the student will reveal to you some kind of deep, dark personal issues that are going on. This is completely normal and you have to deal with it and ask to refer them to counselling even though your thoughts are yelling, ""holy crap, how are you still alive?!"" By the way, pastoral issues such as progression routes, counselling, care, and so on, are doubly important. It is crucial the students feel that they can talk to you about anything because you are usually their first port of call... Not many students refer themselves to student services, and in college, many of them need that extra support. You might also have an issue with attendance and retention, but that is mostly going to come from the management hitting you across the face with graphs of targets and stuff. So you might want to think of ways of retaining learners or keeping up attendance and punctuality. Absences are common, but that does not mean they can go unexplained. Okay, I am going to stop myself here! if you google 'FE college interview questions', there is a couple of resources with example questions, but those points that I mentioned are ones that I have to think about day in, day out, so they are likely to be brought up.",work education got job without interview however know expected management expects hopefully useful know warning going long post one biggest probably ignored obstacle overcome avoid patronising learner especially giving feedback adult see false praise easily extra careful wording feedback positive setting appropriate target friendly yet normal tone voice almost like talking coworker careful completely tear teacher student boundary saying patronising going add include sticker eeeeeeveryone love sticker fact smelly sticker smell like jelly bean coca cola even better sticker starboard game cahoot flashcards board game stuff primary get abandoned lot subject good motivational stuff good mention intend motivate learner especially lot quite insecure education year another big obstacle deal behavioural issue even voluntary subject adult learner free get hell face still remain act like thirty something year old mother supermarket want speak manager suspension rare exclusion even telling learner stand outside class really work kind deal everything conversational way pull learner aside serious chat required end rather class nine time ten student reveal kind deep dark personal issue going completely normal deal ask refer counselling even though thought yelling holy crap still alive way pastoral issue progression route counselling care doubly important crucial student feel talk anything usually first port call many student refer student service college many need extra support might also issue attendance retention mostly going come management hitting across face graph target stuff might want think way retaining learner keeping attendance punctuality absence common mean go unexplained okay going stop google fe college interview question couple resource example question point mentioned one think day day likely brought

highschoolteachers,"I agree; kids are very capable of some amazing things. I do not think it is fair to say they are not capable of thinking/planning just because they are kids. There is lots of adults who have not acquired those skills! I teach high school, so my students are basically adults. Some of them plan and organize better than colleagues of mine. Just today, I subbed for another teacher during my prep period. She had no seating charts. None. No rosters, nothing. It was mind-boggling to me that she would not have *something* for a sub to work with. She left a movie to show, but no equipment to show it on. She left a film guide, but it did not match the movie. It was a planned absence and not even an emergency as far as anyone knew. We did the best we could -- watched the video, talked about it as a class, tried to make a lesson out of it. When the students in her class had me for class later in the day, they expressed frustration at the teacher's lack of preparation (on a daily basis, not merely today). I think they are more perceptive than a lot of people give teens credit for. Yea, they do some boneheaded things, but on the whole, they are still teachable. If they do not know how to handle chaos and abuse, as you mentioned, they can be taught to problem solve and cope (in safe, structured ways) before it is too late. I think most good teachers are doing that in some version or another, but we may all have different language and terminology to describe this type of methodology.

highschoolteachers,"I hit on the idea of using Google Classroom as a way to give students a partially filled-out spreadsheet that they would enter their lab data in. It would graph it for them so that they could see the data quickly for making their conclusions off of it. With conditional formatting, I make all the questions **to be answered in yellow**, and they turn **green when they are complete**. No more blank answers on a worksheet when it highlights exactly where the answers need to go. With data validation, I can limit their choices for answers to make sure that they answer the basic question (like increase, decrease, or stay the same before moving onto an explanation. Wrapping questions with =if(isblank( statements allows me to hide future questions until they have completed previous ones. Of particular value to a science lab is to force them to make a hypothesis and have a question at the end ask them about their specific hypothesis (including the details they selected) using =concatenate statements. On the prelab page, I was able to even check that they entered the correct answers with a few =if statements, and programmed the sheet to display a number of how many they had wrong, so I could quickly check computer screens to see that they had completed the prelab questions and had the basics correct before I let them in the lab. I Have made some tutorial videos on each of these simple parts if you want to build your own sheet like this.

If we had a friend forget to bring an umbrella to our house and it starts to rain, we do not give them a lecture on remembering umbrellas and checking the weather, we loan them our umbrella or walk them out to their car. They still make a note to themselves to consider that next time. I think treating kids with dignity can be important, too. I can see how you could be frustrated when a kid does not improve after the first time. It sounds like you do work with them over and over and are frustrated and looking for a better solution.

highschoolteachers,"This is probably going to sound insane, as so many teachers have the opposite issue, but my administration sometimes comes down *too hard* on kids. Being in such a small school (the one high school in the district has less than 60 kids) means that kids with behavior issues stick out like sore thumbs. At a bigger school, there is more of a rotating door; here, it is the same 4 or 5 kids getting in trouble all the time. Because of this, my administration tends to be inflexible and harsh with punishments come this time of year. I have to be careful how I word my concerns with my principal, as I do not want to because my students more grief. I work hard to start every day as a clean slate for my students; even if you were a major jerk yesterday or really made me mad because you were off task, today is a bright, sun-shiney day where anything is possible. My administrators do not take the same approach. Example: I have a senior who is 100% checked out of high school. She is over it. She got herself into a bad situation last year involving a house party, and she came back this year with a huge chip on her shoulder. Just getting her to turn any assignments in is a struggle; she does not really do anything until her grade is at an F, then she does just enough late work to get up to a D. Her attitude is exhausting, but I work really hard to try to motivate her as best I can. We had a final paper due on Monday. She waited until the VERY LAST SECOND she could have turned it in (greatly compromising the quality of her essay because she rushed through her edits and refused to ask for help). I was expressing my frustration in the lounge that she would wait so long, and my principal overheard and encouraged me to give her a zero on this SUMMATIVE assignment (worth 200 points) because she did not turn it in during my class period, when I told them that they just needed to turn it in my the end of the day.

highschoolteachers,"What grade level you teach should have some bearing on the type of support you offer, in my opinion. By the time a student is a junior or senior in high school, transitioning to a system that holds the student responsible for their own choices is not only ideal but necessary. This precludes the 'culture shock' that accompanies so many graduates. That is not to say the amount of support should be withdrawn, but I teach seniors, and at a certain point I am not going to help a student out if they are not willing to reach out to me. I am not going to hunt them down if they missed assignments, or interrupt my lesson to tell them what they missed while absent, or throw in bonus points for haphazard work. I will go out of my way to ensure they can excel, but only through mutual cooperation. Many of my parents complain that I do not offer the opportunity to make up a '0' after the district-approved standard deduction period passes.

highschoolteachers,"I think this is a really valid question. A trend that I have noticed in the last three years or so is that the students that are successful when they are in high school (specifically the one where I teach) are failing out of college in the first one or two semesters. My students generally go on to associate programs, for context., I remember talking to two of them about a year or so ago, and they both mentioned how while they were in high school, everything was warm and inviting and they got lots of extra help (teachers coming in hours before school starts / staying hours after school let out in order to offer tutoring), but when they got to college, that entire support system was gone. They eventually gave up because it felt like no one cared and no one was there to help them. That conversation completely changed the way I viewed my classroom. I discovered that I was not teaching them how to seek help or get extra practice; I was creating a culture of dependency. At my school a teacher is expected to work before/after school to provide tutoring (which is an entirely different issue...) in order to make sure the students are mastering the material. While that gets them the diploma, is it causing more harm than good?",think really valid question trend noticed last three year student successful specifically one teach failing college first one two semester student generally go associate program context remember talking two year ago mentioned everything warm inviting got lot extra help teacher coming hour start staying hour let order offer tutoring got college entire support system gone eventually gave felt like one cared one help conversation completely changed way viewed classroom discovered teaching seek help get extra practice creating culture dependency teacher expected work provide tutoring entirely different issue order make sure student mastering material get diploma causing harm good

Adults who are less savvy (or perhaps just disinterested) in using the internet to seek out information than their kids can become much less worldly than their kids as a result. I attended a Catholic high school in the mid-oughties. Our senior year, we had to take a morality class that involved a surprisingly liberal scope of discussion. For some reason, the word ""fuck"" was brought up. Our middle aged, neoconservative teacher angrily stated that she hated the word ""because it is a horrible word for making love"". I wan't a hugely sexually active kid, but I remember thinking it was very strange that an adult could think that ""making love"" is the only kind of sex there was. I would imagine some of my fellow students were thinking the same thing; they were dumbfounded.

highschoolteachers,"What level do you teach? I teach 7th graders (12-13 y/o) and they know that ""I was at my locker"" is not a good excuse. ""My locker was jammed"" is not a good excuse. ""I was talking to another teacher"" is not a good excuse unless it comes with a signed note. They know to get their butt to class. When I taught juniors and seniors, I allowed one, MAYBE two excuses like, ""the bus/train was late"" or ""my car stalled"" per year. Buses/trains are designed to run on a steady schedule; I realize they run late occasionally, but not enough that it becomes a recurring excuse. No matter what age you teach, but especially if it is high school, it is a disservice to them to train them to show up to school or work late. Their future bosses will not put up with b.s. excuses, so neither should you. Our current tardy policy is one = a warning, two = a lunch detention, three = phone call home and a lunch detention, and four = a referral. This resets at the end of the trimester. If I were you, I would use a natural break (spring break, end of trimester/semester, etc.) to announce a reset for your class. Use this time to go over all classroom expectations, then end with an emphasis on tardiness. Set your rules, make the consequences expensive, and do not waver.

highschoolteachers,"It is hard to understand all of the negatives without being in the shoe of a teacher. I was involved in education for quite a few years prior to being a classroom teacher and I thought I understood the in's and out's of being a teacher before becoming one.

Your post reminds me of me because you mentioned how you looked forward to coming to work. I remember when I was a teacher's aide I would hate holidays because I could not work. I really enjoyed the interaction I had with the children and other staff members. Once I became a teacher, I realized I had to tone down that interaction. As a TA, I could be their friend more than their teacher. As a teacher, I had to be more like a parent. On top of that, your number one priority is to teach the curriculum so there is not a whole lot of time to enjoy your students. I think that is one of the worst things. Right now I teach high school since I could not get a job teaching elementary. I feel like my classroom is a factory. Kids come in, I teach them, and they leave. There really is almost no time to talk to your students on a personal level. So when the opportunity arises, like they come by for lunch, you are really surprised to find out things about them. The best way analog I can think of is interacting with someone online. It is hard to see their personality. But when you finally meet them face to face, it makes the other person seem more human.

highschoolteachers,"I cannot speak to the education in Great Britain, but over half of the things he complains about I got going through public education: -He complains about not knowing the law, how to vote, how public policy and current events are dealt not dealt with. All of this I discussed in my civics class. -He complains about not knowing about taxes, how much it would cost to live alone or as a family and how much it costs to have a child. This I learned in economics. -He complains a lot about being told more about how to take care of a child, yourself, and general health. This in general I was taught in a class that was labeled ""Social Psychology,"" which was Sex Ed meets common challenges for teens/young adults. I know this specifically varies more dramatically from school to school and how it is implemented or even tolerated from state to state in the United States, so I will not begrudge him so much about that. I also got quite a bit of this education in Biology not only in high school but at the middle school level. The majority of his complaints though I do not accept because they are supposed to be requirements for graduating high school in the first place. In a [subsequent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIu7pE0lBA&amp;) he tackles basically what I have said above- that I got this information and education, but that many do not. He also clarifies that he wants the wasteful subjects, not the kids, out of school. My response to that is that perhaps it is on us collectively, the teachers, to make sure that those are being provided and discussed in the classrooms on a regular basis. Now the other basic premise and complaint that he has is that much of the information that he learned was not only useless but pointless, ranging in topic from higher level Math, Science, History, to English. This is a far broader and more interesting and important question to ask. In the United States the system we currently have is one based upon having a general education attempting to give students proficiency and development in multiple subjects, allowing for the decision for life careers and goals to happen following secondary education, as they transition into higher education, or while in higher education itself. Therefore, secondary education also in the United States is geared and focused toward sending people to higher education. Many other countries have students and pupils make that decision sooner, and therefore allow their students to focus and select their specific learning earlier. If in the United States we were to do as he proposes, there would have to be a serious redesign of not only secondary education, but the transition to higher education. I tend to like the idea and model that we have in the United States about general education and trying to give students multiple fields that they should be proficient, not just introduced to, because it allows for more opportunities should the one idea you wanted to focus on not work out in the future for you. Also, it is important to have a general understanding of how the world works around you. In my opinion, that stretches to the political, social, physical, biological worlds.

highschoolteachers,"Well (most) adults have the ability to focus on work for 6-8 hours at a time. Younger students cannot and should not be working that hard for that long, so homework has a function as spreading the work out over a longer period of time. Parents who are involved in the homework process will also be able to keep up with what their students are studying so they can reinforce those skills, as well as gauge how well their students are progressing. If you know your child struggles with writing assignments every night it will not be a surprise when the teacher brings it up at conferences. If you were not doing that homework, how often do you have your child write or do math? Would you have any idea of their current abilities? In secondary school it starts to develop the self-discipline of doing work while not being directly supervised by a teacher, as it will be in college and most of the the rest of their life. The work must be simple at first and get progressively more and more complex until students can plan and complete entire tasks independently. Otherwise they will be in for a bad shock when they leave high school and there is no adult standing over them to keep them organized and on task. That being said I have seen plenty of teachers assign homework that is inappropriate in length, difficulty or relevancy. That does not mean we need to get rid of homework, but maybe start the conversation at your site about the goal of homework and how you can assign work that meets those goals.",well adult ability focus work hour time younger student cannot working hard long homework function spreading work longer period time parent involved homework process also able keep student studying reinforce skill well gauge well student progressing know child struggle writing assignment every night surprise teacher brings conference homework often child write math would idea current ability secondary start develop self discipline work directly supervised teacher college rest life work must simple first get progressively complex student plan complete entire task independently otherwise bad shock leave adult standing keep organized task said seen plenty teacher assign homework inappropriate length difficulty relevancy mean need get rid homework maybe start conversation site goal homework assign work meet goal

My students are painfully below grade level and the culture of our area does not value education, specifically, does not value English. If you polled the parents in my district, most would probably tell you that their students should not have to take 4 years of ELA because they are going to work on the farm, so it is useless. It is really hard to combat that attitude, and it makes it difficult to get students to buy-in when they have no incentive outside the walls of my room. I love my job, and if I did my life over again, I would not change a thing, but I did feel very frustrated my first month while trying to adjust to this school. I had to lower my expectations in the sense that my students *could not* write on grade level, so I had to start expecting them to write at an 8th grade level and then work up from there. It takes some serious pushing and pulling to have the kind of high-level discussions that I want to have.

They need to learn to problem solve. On a related note, my students contributed to their own grading rubric outlining what kind of work quality gets As, Bs, etc., so they have forfeited all rights to complaining when they get a grade they do not like. (Next year, I am going to be implementing collaborative grading where they grade their own work before I do, so they will be responsible not only for the work but also for justifying the letter grade.)

His reforms, which were similar to NCLB, showed an increase in student performance when implemented.

highschoolteachers,"Good luck! Check to see if the rooms are on the same floor. If so that makes it easier. I was a floating art teacher at a high school for 4 years. Interestingly, I do not have any pictures of my cart. =/ Floating is the most manageable when you have an office or storage space. Having a closet or storage allows you to organize supplies into buckets for easy pull-out. I used a 3-level metal cart [(like this one)](https://images.cb2.com/is/image/CB2/GoCart3ShelfCarbon3QS11/$web_zoom_furn_colormap$/130830204129/go-cart-carbon-three-shelf-table.jpg). On one side, I zip-tied a piece of showerboard (whiteboard that you buy unmounted from Lowe's or HD). On that, I wrote my objectives, curriculum, DOL, etc. On the top level, I kept a clipboard with seating charts, my grade/attendance book (I use a paper copy even though everything is electronic because the paper book is easier to use during messy art class), restroom passes, a pencil cup with my necessary pens, highlighters, etc. I also had [one of these](https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0139846_sc7?$std$) facing the classroom for students to turn work into, with [one of these](https://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0084689_sc7?$std$) on top with two files for each class (one for random bits of paperwork like used hallpasses, and one for graded work I needed to return). I keep anything a student gives me, just in case I need proof. Like the year I almost got in trouble for not allowing a student to go to the clinic, except that I had all of the signed clinic passes that they brought back to me... On the middle level of the cart, I kept the supplies I needed, arranged in bins and tubs for easy moving. The bottom level was for artwork, which varied yearly in how I arranged it. I never found a ""perfect"" solution, but I think the best was plastic portfolios for each class. When I had ""big"" supplies, like paint and brushes, I kept those in a cardboard box and I recruited a student to help me move it to my next room. The only artwork that I did not keep on the cart was sculpture. I did 2 sculpture projects each year, and organized my curriculum with that of my host-teachers, so that my students could store their sculptures in the classrooms without interfering with their sculpture storage. This would comparable to doing group projects in math - I think you would benefit from talking with your host teachers about your plans, and seeing about temporary storage space for such projects. All of my host teachers were willing to work with me, especially once they got to know me. Do not be afraid to work with the teachers. My host teachers would frequently stay in the room to work on things they needed to do, like grading. Part of my classroom rules/expectations had to do with leaving the other teacher alone and not bothering them. If I really needed to work on something in their room during my planning period, I would clear it with them ahead of time, and then would sit quietly in a back corner doing whatever it was.",good luck check see room floor make easier floating art teacher year interestingly picture cart floating manageable office storage space closet storage allows organize supply bucket easy pull used level metal cart like one help image cab com image cab goat shelfcarbon i web zoom turn colormap go cart carbon three shelf table jog one side zip tied piece hoverboard whiteboard buy unmounted lowe he wrote objective curriculum dol etc top level kept clipboard seating chart grade attendance book use paper copy even though everything electronic paper book easier use messy art class restroom pass pencil cup necessary pen highlighter etc also one help wow staple i com image staple so sad facing classroom student turn work one help wow staple i com image staple so sad top two file class one random bit paperwork like used hallpass one graded work needed return keep anything student give case need proof like year almost got trouble allowing student go clinic except signed clinic pass brought back level cart kept supply needed arranged bin tub easy moving bottom level artwork varied yearly arranged never found perfect solution think best plastic portfolio class big supply like paint brush kept cardboard box recruited student help move next room artwork keep cart sculpture sculpture project year organized curriculum host teacher student could store sculpture classroom without interfering sculpture storage would comparable group project math think would benefit talking host teacher plan seeing temporary storage space project host teacher willing work especially got know afraid work teacher host teacher would frequently stay room work thing needed like grading part classroom rule expectation leaving teacher alone bothering really needed work something room planning period would clear ahead time would sit quietly back corner whatever

highschoolteachers,"High school kids are much, much easier behavior-wise than middle school kids (to me). I have taught both age groups. However, middle school kids are still at the age where you can make a major difference in thier lives. I feel like (again- my opinion) reaching a middle school kid is more rewarding, maybe because it IS so much harder to work with them. I had problems teaching middle school last year, myself. It is hard to focus on the kids and a subject when you have trouble fitting in with co-workers, and fitting in is a big thing at my school. I was completely alone, hired two days before the school year began, and was not told anything- not even where to go during a fire drill or how to take attendance. The frustration was overwhelming. I am still the pariah at my school, though a couple of teachers do say 'good morning' to me now. I let the kids walk all over me and had some terrible behavior issues. I had four students diagnosed with ODD in one class, and I, having taught high school a few years earlier, was not aware that kids today can really just say they are not going to do any work and it does not matter. Getting good grades is completely optional at my school because students move to the next level no matter what their grades are. (But guess what- many kids work hard to get good grades and learn new things anyway)! It felt like the world was ending most days last year, but then- I would just think of the kids, even the ones who were difficult to teach: The little computer genius who got all A's without trying and coded during class every chance he got! The great kid who invited me to his baseball game. When his teammate was not doing well pitching he ran right up to him and patted him on the shoulder and encouraged him. The 7th grader who accidentally came to my 8th grade class on the first day of school and sat there cooly until I was finished explaining the syllabus before he admitted his mistake and left. And one 8th grade girl with an amazing, over-the-top personality I will always remember for telling me that I was a good teacher. She even asked for tutoring for subjects I did not even teach! There are so many!! I do not know; I am rambling.I read a book titled ""If You Cannot Manage Them, You Cannot Teach Them."" It is a blunt title, I know. But I got some good tips from the reading. I am going into it this year with the attitude that I am the number one influence in my classroom, and that the students and the subject I teach will be MUCH more important to me than other people's opinions. In short, if you love the kids, are comfortable with having a couple of pretty overwhelming and often frustrating (and at times completely, utterly awful) years and you are ready to work on classroom management (even with kids whose behavior cannot be managed easily), you CAN be a great, inspiring teacher. I really believe you would fall in love with the profession after a while. If you can do these things take the job and get through the first tough years!

highschoolteachers,"I have taught elementary, middle, and am now in my third year of high school. There is something special and awesome about every age. the elementary kids are still little, and sweet, and curious. However the need so much more out of you every single day. The trade off is the whimsy versus the effort. I enjoyed my curriculum in middle school, I taught world cultures and loved it. The kids are definitely moody. The age allows for a mixture between serious and more playful work, and can often be game-i-fied. High School is cool because of the content, I am passionate about it, the kids feed off of that, and every year I get a handful of kids who get turned on to the Social Sciences that maybe would have never been otherwise.

highschoolteachers,"The benefit of ES is the low amount of students, less grading, and ""easier"" material. The benefit of Secondary is generally repeating periods of a single prep so you are planning less. (In terms of workload benefits. Obviously, there are other benefits depending on your preferences!) In ES, you have more planning (though in my district, ES teachers plan only ~6-8 hours per week max and that is if they WANT to use their own stuff, since they have many scripted programs, reading time, etc, plus shared materials on the district level that they are encouraged to use for all but interventions and extensions; I could not teach Elementary here because it is way too scripted). In Secondary, you have more grading in many subjects. (I grade ~150 multi-page essays just about monthly on top of projects, short writing, regular assignments, etc.) Some teachers have hundreds of students (my Band director who has 5 preps also has 600 students and an after school program!) and most of us have at least 125-150 (that is a small load of students, unless you teach something niche like ESE small setting inclusion) whereas our Elementary schools have class caps of 19 (intermediate) and 14 (primary) per the contract and no departmentalization. You can, of course, departmentalize an ES if you WANT to, but you can also use the single class model like my district does where a teacher can focus on a small group of kids and really KNOW them. In Secondary, we still have to constantly draw data on the strengths/weaknesses of our kids, track them, create differentiation to reach them all, but we have so many, it is harder to be effective with that. Just different difficulties. Also, the lesson planning is (I AM GOING TO) more intensive the higher you go in grade level. I have taught Kinder, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 10th, and 11th. For HS, I have to have way more content knowledge and sophistication (especially for my higher level kids to prepare for IB and AP) than MS and definitely more than Kindergarten or 3rd, where actual content knowledge was a non-issue. I do still brush up on my content, though I am an expert and at multidisciplinary content, and I put MLA 8 citations on my slides when I use something from the internet. I do a lot of things I would not do as someone presenting a lesson in Elementary. A lot of preps in high school are particularly hard for newer teachers either because they must fully design courses (like in electives) or have to catch up on a lot of very specific content. You are dealing with different KIDS and different SUBJECTS. One or the other is fine, I find.

I ask because high school art generally has way less discipline problems than a middle school or even than many Elementary specials in some cases. The #1 issue you face with HS students in classes they do not want to be in is skipping, in my experience, in terms of frequency, and skipping -- while bad! -- is just not as in-your-face as the things you face at the lower levels. I am sure this might vary by region and the fact that my school is an open campus and decently affluent/middle class (though we are 1/3 free/reduced lunch so not all kids) affects my view. It sounds like you have never had a permanent, full-time position and the school is, overall, a good school. I would suggest giving it a go if you did not say that you really wanted to turn it down. If you really want to turn it down, you should. You might also want to call the school and talk to them about your concerns and the burnout you feel to suss out how supportive they will be (if you are comfortable turning it down, this cannot hurt -- they may revoke the offer, but who cares at that point?

highschoolteachers,"Welcome to the world of almost any music teacher. A high school choir teacher might have 4-5 different choirs, all that require different repertoire and different rehearsal strategies based upon skill level, behavior, etc. Then they probably teach a few sections of piano, guitar, or music theory in addition to their ensembles. Despite this, unfortunately many people think of us simply as their planning relief, or that our job is easy, we just ""have fun and make music all day!"" My advice is to stay WAY in front of your planning and keep meticulous notes about what each class gets to/does not get to in your plans so that you can adjust as you go. You might want to set a routine for the week that you follow for the year.. for instance in my choir classes every Monday-Wednesday we work on new sections music, every Thursday is dedicated to theory/written work, and Fridays we review what we did over the week or have tests/ quizzes when needed.

highschoolteachers,"The shortest answer is almost all standards, college courses, and higher high school courses require that knowledge and information. Many individual teachers do not have the ability or flexibility to modify content that drastically. In terms of conceptualization, I describe it to my students into two main ways: 1) It is an important distinction to showcase functions being represented in different ways. The ability to manipulate one equation into others is the vast majority of high level mathematics. Just like solving a linear equation means creating a wide variety of equivalent expressions and equations, modifying linear functions into others is a very valuable and translatable math skill. 2) Using the example of standard, point slope, and slope intercept form - each of these equations is most valuable in different situations. Also converting a visual or graphical representation is easier if certain considering are met. For example, a decimal y intercept is very difficult for slope intercept form if it is not given in the actual situation. If you have two random points, it is much easier in point slope. Teaching when one type is valuable over others is a lesson that had incredible value with my students. So I cannot speak for that specific teacher, but those are the general ways I explain the reasoning to my students.",shortest answer almost standard college course higher course require knowledge information many individual teacher ability flexibility modify content drastically term conceptualization describe student two main way important distinction showcase function represented different way ability manipulate one equation others vast majority level mathematics like solving linear equation mean creating wide variety equivalent expression equation modifying linear function others valuable untranslatable math skill using example standard point slope slope intercept form equation valuable different situation also converting visual graphical representation easier certain considering met example decimal intercept difficult slope intercept form given actual situation two random point much easier point slope teaching one type valuable others lesson incredible value student cannot speak specific teacher general way explain reasoning student

If you can spend some time every day talking to kids and getting to know them (silly questions, not math related) that will go a long way in getting them to work for you 4) get real with them. In my classes, I wanted students to feel free to express how they felt so that they would be more comfortable and willing to do what I asked.

highschoolteachers,"Year 9 Social Studies (13-14yo) and Year 12 Social Studies (16-17yo).

Things I hate about the Year 9s: bad habits (academic and behavioural) start early and you have to nip them in the bud, Year 9s are new to high school so they love to start drama just to see where it happens, if I have them the period after lunch time or the last period of the day they are usually too hyped up to learn anything, sometimes they just have bad days behaviour-wise and I am trying not to lose sleep over it. Things I love about the Year 12s: more collegial relationships, not as demanding of my attention Things I hate about the Year 12s: if they are not motivated, do not expect them to hand anything in. The bad habits they developed in the previous year levels are set in and become very hard to break, especially when it comes to academic skills. They have other things on their mind like getting part-time jobs or driver's licences or their love lives and tend to forget that school is still the most important thing.

highschoolteachers,"I work at a school that is tied with a orgainzation that deals with children who have experienced repeated trauma and are dealing with emotional and behavioral problems (Self harm, suicide, drug use, sexual abuse). Most of the clients/students have either been court ordered there or recommended by a psychiatric institution. The school is under staffed and underfunded. We only have four main teachers, the principal, one EC coordinator, and a data manager. We also have two day treatment staff but they are not part of the school staff. Anyways the school had normally ran a year long schedule for some unknown reason. This year the principal is wanting to switch to semesters to offer more classes/credits. However she is also wanting more EC staff and has been trying to get all of the teachers EC certified (even though some of us have been trying to tell her that even if we could pass the test it does not mean we could do the job) with the idea of one of the teachers acting as a second EC staff and doing one-on-one support in the room. This means we are going to have two, three block, semesters where I will be teaching ELA in the fall and social studies in the spring. And to make it even more fun we have mixed classrooms. In a perfect setup I may have all middle school kids in one class and all high school kids in another. However that rarely works and due to behavioral issues or not having enough room in one class we may end up with a handful of all grades in each class. A lot of times it feels like the school portion is an afterthought. And I know my principal is doing the best she can, its just that without more admin staff she has to try and do everything her self which also puts a lot of pressure on us teachers. So yeah its an interesting situation. And last year teaching there was my first year teaching. Really I was going to try and find a job at a standard school this year but with both our data manager and math teacher leaving I felt like I should stay just so our principal did not crazy from loosing half of her teaching staff plus all her admin staff in a single year. As for why I was picked? Well mainly because I am right out of college so it apparently means I can do everything!!! At first the principal wanted me to teach Maths. I had to put my foot down on that one. It would not have been good for me or the students. At one point she wanted me to do Science so our science teacher could do the EC stuff. However I feel that our science teacher probably talked her out of that. But hey at least I am certified to teach middle school science so it would have been closer. I would have been doing EC this semester if PRAXIS did not screw up and give me the wrong test (the main one you have to take for Social Studies). Ohh and she still wants everyone to take the test as soon as possible anyways. So yeah that is why I will be doing ELA without a certification. As to if that is legal in my state? I am unsure. We already straddle the line between public and private school due to our setup as being a medical facility so I think we have some leeway. I mean it would not be the first sketchy thing.

In any case, even if there is an example of it working, at what does it work? How many years of students suffer through going to a bad school because in order to give the public power? I have given the example of my town's high school, with no separate optikn. People have banded together in the past the past to fix it. It has not worked. People have different visions of what they want, and that has translated into no policies being passed, or bad policies being passed. This makes sense... it is a single school trying to meet the needs of a population of 35000 people. What has happened as a result? A failing school in way more ways than test scores. The college admission and drop out rate is very high, gangs are prevelant, truancy levels are far above average... all this in addition to horrible test scores. Parents shold have an individual choice because they are individual families with individual needs. What your kids need is likely not what my kids need, and that is a good thing.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;The boy who put the stray kitten in his locker that he found on the way to school so he could take it home after school. Aw. That is kind of cute actually. When I was in high school, I decided to get a pet rat without consulting my mother. Instead of leaving it at home where it could be found, I took this rat everywhere with me. This rat stayed inside a modified purse (with bedding, water, breathing holes) or my cargo pants pocket. It came with me to school everyday and even to my after school jobs--Sonic Drive-In and Bi-Lo. (What is health codes and sanitation when you are 15?) I did this with more than one rat. My last one escaped while I was shopping for prom dresses at the mall. No adults ever discovered my rat babies. I just thought I needed to share that.",it boy put stray kitten locker found way could take home aw kind cute actually decided get pet rat without consulting mother instead leaving home could found took rat everywhere rat stayed inside modified purse bedding water breathing hole cargo pant pocket came everyday even job sonic drive bi lo health code sanitation one rat last one escaped shopping prom dress mall adult ever discovered rat baby thought needed share
highschoolteachers,"Heh this resonates a lot with me, thanks for sharing. I taught in Asia for several years, and during such time continued my studies. I did the TR course and decided to give it a go back here in the states for a bit. I am sort of torn on the whole deal so far. Granted, it is the beginning of the year and my American teaching career but I find it pretty dispiriting. First, tests. I work at a relatively low level school and it seems it is an endless barrage of tests. I have read some stories that say it is not as bad as initially reported but I disagree. My students are very low level, and in a high school setting are not likely to pass the exams. Thus, they get to sit the tests over, and over, and over. (Because yeah, it is fair to give them as many chances as possible in order to get a diploma). Then we have curriculum. The curriculum is not bad for kiddos who are at grade level, but mine are several years lower. So, I am busy scrambling for materials so that my kids can learn *something*. Finally, of course the behavioral issues we see here vs what I am used to in my previous jobs in Asia. Much has been said here. Well, TL;DR: Get your credential through an alternative program and perhaps look at gigs back in Asia.

highschoolteachers,"First day for me is always the same. But then, I teach high school physics and I start at the beginning of the year...so as a student teacher, your mileage may vary. 1) I start with activities to help me benchmark them and for them to benchmark me. I give them something that I can see their strengths and weaknesses. I usually start with a lab activity doing something they already know but need to learn how to explain. For me, it is measuring speed of a toy car and presenting it as a lab report. For you...well, that might be different. 2) I think most new teachers in a good district will use their coworkers as pacing guides. Or at least I did and it saved me bacon. If you are lucky your coworkers will be willing to share. I personally do not understand why anyone would not share. Especially in elementary school, is not that a thing you guys/gals teach? 3) It varies. In Pennsylvania you are supposed to be assigned a mentor when hired and be mentored for the first year or two. There is also a multi year induction system designed to acclimate you to your district. Mine does a great job with that, I do not know about other districts/states. But coworkers, again, are your saviors. Be nice to them, listen to them AND do not be afraid to deviate from them. Likely, you will start as they do and then, as the year and future years go on, you will develop your own style. You are not going to be perfect the first time through. That is OK. Do your best, work hard, and when you make a mistake (you will, trust me....from experience) get back up, figure out what went wrong (that is important!) and figure out how to change it. One of the best parts about this job is that you get another chance to fix it for next year. You will always be changing what you do.

I have not really had to do this in HS, thank God (and actually never had to do much of this BS when I briefly taught ES, but that was overseas), but I taught middle school for a long time and they are annoying about this shit. First, I make the student write a statement if it is something that really mattered. Then, I will investigate, maybe have the ""offender"" write a statement too. If it is something that actually mattered, the class usually witnessed it and someone will speak out (write out really). I teach them early on that it is not ""snitching"" to help someone get legitimate justice, like if Sally's phone is stolen and you do not say who took it, you are just as guilty, and think how you would feel in Sally's place. I usually have enough decent folk that Sally's phone always got found. If not, I would turn it over to a Dean. But even with little ones, I would not go around policing that someone said your bag was ugly.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;I do have a great admiration for charter schools and online schools and I do anticipate that as schools, like my prior high school, continue to fail their students, these options will become more prevalent. This opinion of yours assumes two equally false premises: one, that on the whole public schools ""fail their students"" (oft-repeated and rarely defined) and two, that on the whole charter schools do not (by similarly dubious, hackneyed measures). If you want to understand the toxicity of the charter/school choice/school reform/privatization movement (all once separate ideas that have now unapologetically merged into a single, corporate-controlled monstrosity), you might consider starting with Michelle Rhee's disastrous reign as DC's chancellor. It is a textbook example of a corrupt school official destroying public education and then walking off scot-free to a cushy lobbying job--employed by the same moneyed interests that bought her loyalty in the first place.",it great admiration charter school online school anticipate school like prior continue fail student option become prevalent opinion assumes two equally false premise one whole public school fail student oft repeated rarely defined two whole charter school similarly dubious hackneyed measure want understand toxicity charter choice reform privatization movement separate idea unapologetically merged single corporate controlled monstrosity might consider starting michelle rhee disastrous reign do chancellor textbook example corrupt official destroying public education walking scot free cushy lobbying job employed moneyed interest bought loyalty first place
highschoolteachers,"Speaking as someone who feared public speaking in high school, and visibly shook with a cracking voice no matter how well prepared I was, if I had the 'out' of doing a presentation only in front of my teacher after school, there would be no scenario where I would choose to instead speak in front of my class. It would simply be unthinkable, like asking if person with a broken leg whether he would like to try walking without crutches today. There are ways to break down this fear, but I would not start by having the kid talk in front of a full classroom. It will be hard enough doing the presentation only in front of you. I would have been deeply troubled to be asked 3 times in class when this other arrangement had already been made. So, I feel the student's pain. You might think you only asked twice, but the first 'How are you feeling?' is, to the student, you asking if she will do it. She knew where that question was leading. After she said ""Not good,"" to her any further mention of the matter is unwelcome and anxiety-inducing. If it happened to me, I would feel extra unhappy in doing the presentation after school because I would feel like my teacher really, really, really wanted me to do it in class and was not supportive of the agreement that had been made. That said, I never got that sort of option in high school. Edit: As for how to proceed, you need to repair the relationship with the student. I would do that by explaining my behavior -- my thought process -- and profusely apologize.

Each assessment is broken up by standards (we just gave our third test, it tested 3 of the standards, so we report those three standards as a percent). Each standard will be assessed at least 3 times, with the newer times assessing it being weighted double the previous time's weight. So we are a hybrid of SBG and points.

highschoolteachers,"Maybe I am biased, but I absolutely love the concept of CLEP tests. They really have had my back when trying to fast-track through college and I had a lot of good experience with the tests. I have never taken an AP class, but I know the concept really scared me as a high schooler. I never thought I was smart enough for AP classes (and my grades sure were not good enough) but heck yeah I can pass a test if I study for it. I honestly do not really know how AP works in terms of colleges accepting it as credit--is it universal and all colleges accept it? Because I know only certain colleges accept specific CLEPS. My tech school accepted all of them, but when I transferred to a 4-year, there were a lot of CLEPs they did not accept or had a significantly higher score needed for credit (instead of a 50, you needed a 64). I always based my CLEPs on my 4-year school, so that was not a problem for me, but I could see that being a problem for students who do not know what school they are going to. But overall, I love CLEP. I think a course that teaches how to properly study for a CLEP exam could really apply to any CLEP and teach a student valuable self-study and self-teaching techniques. That is how I would run it if I were teaching it--show them the resources available, how to prepare, independent study techniques that could apply to any subject while helping them succeed on the CLEP at hand. I mean, I have known several people who can pass a CLEP with only a few weeks of studying, and although the information may not necessarily stick forever (what year a certain legislation was proposed), it helps students knock out the ""boring"" gen eds and focus on the stuff they really like--or knock out the stuff they are already really strong in and do not want to waste a semester on--or knock out pre-requisites for classes they would rather take. Unlike AP exams, CLEPs can be taken at any time time, students can take as little or as much time prepping for it, and colleges generally accept a whole lot of them (I was allowed to transfer up to 20 CLEPs if I wanted...). So yeah, I am a fan, and I would rather teach a CLEP prep class than an AP class, too, but I am biased with limited AP knowledge.",maybe biased absolutely love concept clip test really back trying fast track college lot good experience test never taken ap class know concept really scared schooler never thought smart enough ap class grade sure good enough heck yeah pas test study honestly really know ap work term college accepting credit universal college accept know certain college accept specific clips tech accepted transferred year lot clips accept significantly higher score needed credit instead needed always based clips year problem could see problem student know going overall love clip think course teach properly study clip exam could really apply clip teach student valuable self study self teaching technique would run teaching show resource available prepare independent study technique could apply subject helping succeed clip hand mean known several people pas clip week studying although information may necessarily stick forever year certain legislation proposed help student knock boring gen ed focus stuff really like knock stuff already really strong want waste semester knock pre requisite class would rather take unlike ap exam clips taken time time student take little much time prepping college generally accept whole lot allowed transfer clips wanted yeah fan would rather teach clip prep class ap class biased limited ap knowledge

highschoolteachers,"Letting us fail. Freshman year of high school I was part of a new PBL department. I was one of 40ish students and 4 teachers. We had our own little building and it was all PBL style course work all day. Of course, we (students) had never seen anything like this. There was a group of 8 students, me included, who just excelled at it. It was really our cup of tea. We took off. Until...we got to our final project. I am a natural leader when it comes to stuff like this, but the department head teacher put another student in charge of the group. That student did not know how to manage time or the rest of us kids. The project was a total bomb. It did not even get 50% finished. At the time, 15yr old me thought the teacher was just ridiculous for not usurping the student leader. But letting us fail in that project taught me about working with others, time management, and real world skills. Which, those skills are probably more practical than learning about the top 100 people of the 20th century (project theme). As a beginning teacher, I had a problem with letting my little ones fail. I am much better now. I think about this high school project often. I have to admit, my little ones have never come close to failing as hard as we did.

highschoolteachers,"Ok, if you have 3 minutes to kill, watch this: https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teacher-assessment-strategy I know they are little kids in the video, but trust me, the method works for high school too (and adults as well) and any subject. There are several keys to really make it work: - It needs to be a daily routine. So that means in your daily plan, you know that you devote that last 5-7 minutes to this. It cannot work if you do not get to it. - It needs to be daily or almost daily to work. - You need to make sure you are actually assessing for what they learned that day. It sounds silly, but I see teachers constantly giving exit tickets about stuff they did not learn during that specific lesson - then there is no point. - Notice how the teacher in the video reassures the students that it is not a big test. You say your students freak out about their grades. They need to know it will happen sometimes that they will bomb the exit tickets. And that is fine for two reasons: there are so many of them that their average will be barely affected by an occasional bomb - and also you are not weighing them the same as a regular test. It is totally OK to be transparent about them about the purpose of exit tickets. It is to measure what they learned that specific day to see what they understood, how much they understood, and what you need to re-teach (and it is ok to tell them something like ""sometimes I think I explained it well but I did not and I'ld rather know sooner rather than later so I can re-teach you differently instead of everybody bombing the test"") - Finally, and most critical: those exit tickets will reveal patterns of understandings and misunderstandings. It is crucial that you address the misunderstandings right away - as in the next lesson. Those exit tickets inform your instruction more than anything. They help you revise your plan and make sure students have strong foundations before moving on to new concepts that they will be lost in. Reteaching is a difficult concept to handle for many teachers because of the pressure to cover X, Y, and Z in a limited amount of time. But trust me, and no admin in the world will go against it, a good teacher would rather have the teacher cover 80% of the curriculum with most students getting it than 100% of the curriculum with a bunch of students completely lost and having learned almost nothing all year.",ok minute kill watch help wow teachingchannel org video teacher assessment strategy know little kid video trust method work adult well subject several key really make work need daily routine mean daily plan know devote last minute cannot work get need daily almost daily work need make sure actually assessing learned day sound silly see teacher constantly giving exit ticket stuff learn specific lesson point notice teacher video reassures student big test say student freak grade need know happen sometimes bomb exit ticket fine two reason many average barely affected occasional bomb also weighing regular test totally ok transparent purpose exit ticket measure learned specific day see understood much understood need teach ok tell something like sometimes think explained well old rather know sooner rather later teach differently instead everybody bombing test finally critical exit ticket reveal pattern understanding misunderstanding crucial address misunderstanding right away next lesson exit ticket inform instruction anything help revise plan make sure student strong foundation moving new concept lost teaching difficult concept handle many teacher pressure cover i i limited amount time trust admin world go good teacher would rather teacher cover curriculum student getting curriculum bunch student completely lost learned almost nothing year
highschoolteachers,"There is more to diversity than race. Three years ago our school also did a score breakdown based on 5 years of data to address the issue of girls scoring higher and finishing high school in higher rates than boys on average. Much, much higher. 80% retention in boys compared to 97% retention for girls. Our admin also broke the data down by location in and around the town, intending for it to be a representative of ""class diversity."" I do not know that we used this to alter our academic standards or expectations, we just wanted to understand. In my opinion, I do not teach math, I teach students. The better I know them, the better I can teach them. Of course I expect them to be responsible for their own education, but it does not hurt to gain some perspective on their performance by analyzing data. Having said that, I agree with you that the collegiate level as a whole is pandering way too much to diversity of skin color, and probably sacrificing a lot of academic integrity in the process.

highschoolteachers,"I understand why you want to use rewards, but I think that the baseline idea that you are rewarding those who are already doing well is ignoring a REALLY big underlying problem: If it feels like a reward to those that are already excelling, then to those that are not, it feels like a punishment. You are viewing it as ""less work for those that have earned it"" but for everyone else it is pretty easy to feel like you are punishing them for not showing mastery. If you are giving those that are not doing well, more work, and then saying you do not understand why they are not motivated or interested, then I think you have a much bigger problem than a few unmotivated students. You have built a structure in which you are punishing those students that probably need more praise or guidance than punishment. Another kind of big problem with this, is that it is only October and some students are already showing mastery while others are not, then you are really rewarding those that are coming to your class with a better background (whether that means study skills at home or general background knowledge) instead of rewarding those that have shown the most growth Along with that, if you are only giving extra turns in games/competitions/etc, then you are telling those in the bottom half, ""I know this is harder for you, and I am going to punish you for that."" As a new teacher it is very easy to say, ""This student is unmotivated, I am going to reward the others in an attempt to motivate them."" but what you are doing is creating a culture in which you are punishing those students and getting frustrated when they do not feel a need to succeed in your class. I am sorry if this comment sounds rude or belittling, but it really irks me when teachers ignore the fact that a ""reward for some"" really means a ""punishment for most"". One more edit: I am sorry but if you, the teacher, knows that the class is mundane, then kids being unmotivated is absolutely not their fault. Being a young teacher is hard, but relying on prizes to make your class fun is a short-sighted solution to a long-term problem. I would talk to other teachers in your building about what they have done that is been successful, and even talk to kids about classes that they love and see what you can bring from their favorite class to your own.

I tried to say that for high school math (geometry and above), all math problems are more or less essays (especially those requiring proofs), without the need for lengthy explanations as you might find in a mathematical journal, so essays were not really appropriate, but they did not buy it and said that I had to put questions which could be answered in ""paragraph form"".",administration micromanagement bureaucracy kill teacher morale worse game losing streak football explosion lab week track field coach public got trouble violating rule physical contact student administering first aid student got hurt sure understand rule first place clearly difference inappropriate contact first aid also former required u put least essay question exam including math test tried say math geometry math problem le essay especially requiring proof without need lengthy explanation might find mathematical journal essay really appropriate buy said put question could answered paragraph form

highschoolteachers,"My high school uses a freshman seminar that works VERY well. Of course, that does not help you, the classroom teacher. But it could help the school as a whole. The freshman seminar engages in study skills, homework help and tutoring, organizational skills, goal tracking, career study, Genius hour stuff, and some kind of A/R type reading (that is not A/R). The kids get really good organizational skills from it, and it probably is the biggest way they are set up for success. It is an elective credit, but it is basically mandatory unless a parent super complains (and they almost never do because it works so well). As far as strategies in the classroom... I cannot imagine 75% of my students with Ds... we probably teach different student populations.... but I really find it gets me more work back when I outline what will be due for a LONGER period of time (a week at least) and give reminders daily about turn-in dates, etc. Next day homework just does not work for me or many of my students, and I get why (they had a recital, a game, a birthday party, whatever). I require notice from my bosses, so I give it to the kids. For classwork, I set ""goal deadlines"" but take work until 3 days after the end of the unit (units are 2-4 weeks)---but the ""0"" goes in at the goal deadline to remind them, and they usually freak out when that happens and get a move on before the real deadline (and this is exactly the kind of shit I had to do when managing adults and do for MYSELF frankly, I think it is human nature). For assessments, there are firmer due dates (10% penalty each day if late, up to 5 days late), but the kids get extended notice (at least 1 week advance notice). I do not really give homework (except a tiny amount of Khan Academy Grammar) but rather give a lot of work, more than can be done in the work times given in class. Thus, students prioritize what they need help with during work times in class (which is not every day or the whole period) and then do at home what they feel comfortable with. Psychologically, it also helps because they see my class as having no homework and the assignments as just what they should have finished in class (""mwahhahah"" my plan!).

highschoolteachers,"Jeese...there was a whole TIL about homework and depression. Annoyed the shit out of me because most people just wanted to add their anecdotal experience to it...""Yah, I remember getting depressed because I had 4 hours of homework EVERY NIGHT."" I swear to god I took Advanced and AP classes in high school. I had maybe 1-2 hours a night at most as long as I did not procrastinate. I do not know if people are just lying, remembering incorrectly or just really stupid so it takes them 4 hours to do... And I had my homework when you could not just google how to do a problem. Anyways, I think 10 minutes or homework a grade level is a good guide. So if these are 9th graders then 90 minutes of homework is not out of the question. They should be doing the same in middle school...70 minutes, 80 minutes. And they should somehow force consistency because I know some days students have zero homework and then homework is suddenly piled on another day. My school attempted assigning days that homework could be assigned by department, but it is difficult to do in a high school because then you have to separate out the Advanced/AP courses from the on-level as those courses will naturally have more homework. Regardless, this middle school is ridiculous and you should stick to your guns. It seems like you have covered your bases. Maybe you can do a quiz over the homework every 2-3 days? ""Hey guys...I am going to have a quiz in a couple of days on the homework I have collected up until then. If you do it then you will already know how to do the quiz."" Sort of covers the bases...if they ""did"" the homework, but fail the quiz then you know they must be cheating.

highschoolteachers,"I am dealing with the same thing in my high school classes. It seems like special ed staff everywhere just have the habit of dropping off a high-needs kid with no support, supervision or even a check-in, and blaming teachers for not being ""patient"" or ""understanding the situation"". You are right to be concerned about your tenure-related authority. Create a paper trail, and call as many meetings as you can reasonably afford with the objective of ""how can you help me, help him?"" Document the response. Call the parents. Talk to admin. Remember that the rule for special ed is the ""least restrictive, appropriate environment"" and that many people love to abuse this subjectivity to make their own jobs easier. If you can show the time and support invested in the child, the cost to other students, and the learning that has been produced (or not produced) after several weeks, I think you can expect/demand a straightforward articulation of their expectations.

highschoolteachers,"I used to be you. The ill health, the wishing something would happen so I did not have to go to work. I do not have a magic answer, as I am still improving, but my major mistake (and possibly yours) is that I had no consequence in my classroom for poor behaviour. (Hell, I NEEDED my lunch hour/interval. I did not want to spend it in detention myself!) This creates a rod for your own back as the kids will just get worse and worse. Think of some consequences - staying in at interval, contacting parents, sending them to a Dean, changing the seating plan. You MUST follow through. And the number of detentions I have handed out far exceed the number I have to attend myself. What I mean is, often the little darlings will not turn up and it then goes to the Dean. I am also a nice person who the kids take advantage of. I spend time at home on sites where the children are described as little s**ts, and this puts me in a frame of mind where I can send them to the Dean and not fall for their sob-stories. Things have improved markedly for me. I am not at the stage where I particularly look forward to seeing all of them, but it is MUCH better. My stress levels are much lower, my mental and physical health is improved, and I have the mental space to plan lessons instead of sitting she will-shocked at the end of the day. EDIT: 90 minutes is a hell of a long lesson. Set a routine where they know that they have to read silently when they have finished their regular work. Have a stack of books they can read if they have not brought one of their own. EDIT2: Some kids love to clean the blackboard, or hand out books. Use this to your advantage. And blatantly use rewards to elicit good behaviour. I have just finished a two week holiday, and been doing reflection; although I have got consequences, I have not yet instilled rewards for good behaviour. It can be as simple as ""Good job, Fred"" if they have got their book out. Should be unnecessary and part of a high school student's routine, but with my class...!

highschoolteachers,"Let me start with this: I am a high school math teacher in a title 1, rural school and I only teach the lowest level of student. My best class is a collab class with about 8 IEP students and a revolving door of low level students that transfer around while their parents work different minimum wage jobs. I was tired of the ""shotgun approach"" and students not working due to a high level of performance anxiety. They would not complete anything unless they felt that they fully understood the topic, which is difficult with any new topic if you do not try. So I made a huge decision to ""release"" the responsibility that was not really mine by transitioning my students into semi-self paced learners. I say ""semi"" because of how I have structured the pacing. I may not be the right kind of motivational person to be a teacher, but I know that the students are not going to work on learning something difficult unless there are incentives for them to keep moving. My students can sit where they like as long as they are making forward progress. When they are not, I sequester them from their friends by having them come up front as one of my VIPs. They want to get out of it and back with their friends AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. It is the best thing I have ever done. Combined with a good online LMS that I can structure to give loads of feedback, my student grades on similar assessments compared to previous years is through the roof. I find that my students want to succeed because they know that with enough effort, they can earn that grade they want. The biggest drawback that I would give is that I am often frustrated with pacing, but that is on me and I find myself paring away any extra that is not really focused on the task at hand so that we can cover the curriculum. I find that I must be ok with a certain level of chaos, and that is hard coming from a traditional education college. My profs were not the type to encourage this level of innovation that my students love. And they do love it. While they may not be math lovers, they will at least be math achievers by the end of the year, and maybe that is enough. Good luck!

highschoolteachers,"Syntax is crucial to a lot of forms of writing. The degree of precision in syntax becomes higher stakes in college level or higher level academic writing (not so much high school level academic writing per se, though it matters some there; I would consider college entry-level English/Comp classes at the high school level, frankly), technical writing, and -- for entirely different reasons -- narrative writing. If she is what I would consider a ""purist"" for academic writing, the key to correct syntax is to -- while following all the other ""rules"" like active voice and grammatical constraints -- be clear, brief, and as clinical/technical as possible. This would not necessarily be as true in a literary examination as it would be for academic writing in most areas, to be fair. I found that in other disciplines, outside of literary circles, there is much less flair and it feels more similar to technical writing (though not the same). Of course, she may have an entirely different preference. I am guessing wildly, to be clear. The example you gave does not really suit the question you are asking, unfortunately, and which one is ""better"" is not really a question that makes sense out of context. So, that is why I cannot answer. Which one is better? Better for what? The key to style is suiting the style of the task. So, yes, different iterations of the idea have different value, but as to which is ""better,"" it is impossible to say without consideration of the task. For expression on a message forum? There is no ""right"" answer here, as this is entirely subjective (no rubric, no common guidelines, grammar errors abound on message forums like reddit, so judging which ""syntax"" is better seems arbitrary here). Though I would say: &gt;Which, I admit, is quite vague. This was probably the most appropriate one for the context, in terms of voice conveyed, though I think it would work better attached to the sentence than as a fragment. It feels a bit jarring. &gt;Which is quite vague, I must admit The ""I must admit"" has a weird Scarlett O'Hara thing or sounds mildly sarcastic somehow. &gt;I admit it is quite vague This is okay, but it feels less conversational and unfinished, like you were going to say ""but..."" and add something. &gt;It is vague, I know This also feels in need of a follow up. &gt;I know it is vague As does this. &gt;Vague, yes it is This is extremely awkward syntax that sounds like a bad translation from another language. &gt;Yes it is vague Again, feels in need of a follow up.

highschoolteachers,"In like ten years, I have only had no plans left once or twice. My school district basically uses all the same curricula in the elementary schools, so once you get used to that, it is easy to figure out what to do. Also, most teachers in the same grades work together on what is going on, so you can always ask the neighbor teacher. Sure, of course leave a note. But I have never understood subs who leave long narratives for the teacher. I am very utilitarian. We did XYZ that you expected; X kid refused to work and was disruptive in X way; there was not enough time to accomplish X... Honestly, you do not need to write a novel. It looks like ass-kissing. (So I guess if you are angling for a job at that school, maybe okay, you need to kiss ass. I do not.) Elementary is easier on the soul, because they are usually not mean to you as a sub until about Fourth Grade. Then things get dodgy. Middle school and high school can be difficult because they can be rude/ mean, but the work is easier, because repetitive and they are in and out--and you get a free period, usually.) So basically, there will usually be one or two ""bad classes"" where they are disruptive/defiant. Your job is not to take it personally, stay the course, do not get angry, and write down names of kids who are really bad news. After many years, I have basically made it a policy of dealing with all discipline issues myself, rather than getting involved with the office. Basically, until they know you, it is not worth it to make others deal with your discipline problems. Time out chairs for the littles, talking to them about what is going on, and with older students, simply informing them that any misbehavior will be passed on to their teacher. Generally, with older kids--they do not know you, and they do not care about you, and getting into power struggles tends to be a big mistake. Getting angry is also a big mistake. Yelling is a mistake. Presumably you know how to use a smartboard. Many teachers will leave their plans on a drive plugged into the computer to use. Most will leave clear directions. So basically, your job is to figure out and follow directions. Getting to school when you are supposed to makes that most possible. (Sometimes teachers are disorganized or unclear, so it sometimes takes a while to figure out where everything is.) I do not carry ""extra work"" with me to do, but instead find short entertaining educational videos that are relevant to the work they are doing that day. Or if they are small, read a book to them. A bit of entertainment from a sub makes things go smoother, in my opinion. (You are a sub--it is better to be the ""fun sub"" who gets everything accomplished and gives them a ""treat"".) I use thekidshouldseethis.com for kid-friendly but smart shorts. (Be careful of Youtube. The ads or other videos can be wildly inappropriate and because disruption.) Honestly, the most important thing to remember is that you are simultaneously the lowest rung on the totem pole (and so be careful of offending the other staff), and also the most desired person in the building, because most school districts pay for shit and there is a sub shortage. So they simultaneously disrespect you and want to make you want to come back. It is weird. If you can find a school you like, have a card you can give to certain teachers so they can request you. I have kept a blacklist for years of classrooms and teachers I will never teach for again, and I refer to it. My district is big enough that I have no problem getting jobs either way. In my state (Minnesota), there are two types of licenses: short call sub (which covers k-12 all subjects, but you cannot work more than two weeks in any specific job) and subject specific (in which you can replace someone in your area of expertise if they drop dead or something). If you want to get called for jobs every day, have a short call license, because there are lots of subjects that suffer for lack of subs (like special ed, business or graphic design or phy ed). They try to tell you that turning down jobs on the call system will penalize you in the algorithm. I have found that at least in my district, this is not the case, and I turn down far more jobs than I take. No big deal. Be picky, and be happier. Most importantly, do not let the assholes get you down. The biggest advantage of being a substitute is being able to take days off whenever you want. Remember that they need you, desperately. Be competent, and do your best, but do not let mistreatment on the part of students or staff get you down. Just walk out of that building at the end of the day and do not come back until you have forgotten what was so depressing.

Total commitment."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PmMIMW5HJY In all seriousness, though, I think the problem is even more amplified by the College Board and the entire ""resume arms race"" taking place in recent years. We tell our students to load up on extracurricular activities, while taking at least three AP classes per year starting in sophomore year, achieve perfect scores in all their classes, test and retest on the SAT/ACT/SAT II's/etc in the hope of getting all their scholarships together to attend their Dream School. Because, apparently, if they do not attend their Dream School, then their life is worthless and they will never have the ability to be happy. Oh, and then we throw on that they should also try to ""enjoy high school while it lasts, because it is the best years of their lives."" Gee... if they really internalized that they were going through this hell, and thought that *this* would be the happiest they would ever be in their lives, maybe this starts to explain some of the teen suicide, depression, and anxiety problems we are seeing in schools. Meanwhile, going to an affordable, mid-level college is probably more education than many of their peers will ever get, because somebody has to be a mechanic, plumber, electrician, sanitation worker, custodian, etc, and these jobs do not typically require a college degree. What is more, they would probably be happier and able to afford their loans, versus graduating with $30K, $50K, even $100K or more in student loans. We are teaching them to want nothing but the best for themselves, because we think they need ""the best"" in order to be happy. It turns out, the generic brand can make them just as happy for much less grief, effort, and money. Who knew. Anyway, you are definitely onto something. I wish there were more journalists covering issues in education; when I tell the story of NJ DOE's commissioner and one of the testing companies affiliated with the PARCC exam to non-teaching friends, their eyes immediately go bug-eyed.

highschoolteachers,"I moved from NC to CO last summer! I am in the Denver-area and competition for jobs here (even in science) is much more intense than in NC. I am not sure where you live in NC, but I have a lot of friends who were basically able to walk into a school with no teaching experience and be hired as lateral entry teachers in STEM positions. Some were fresh out of college and did not even have other work experience. If you want to move to Colorado, you need to start looking for teaching jobs now. The big districts will be posting them soon if not already. Every school I interviewed at last spring asked me for either a teaching video or to come in and teach a demo lesson. I still found a job, but it paid less (charter school) and was not in my preferred subject/age range (I prefer high school bio but this was middle school science). Perhaps more rural areas would be more open to hiring lateral entry teachers? If you are open to charters, DPS in Denver has a ton. Several of my colleagues at the charter school had no teaching experience or license. You need to be ""highly qualified,"" which for 7-12 science means you are licensed, you have passed the general science PRAXIS, or you have taken at least 24 hours of relevant science classes. Charters would be your best bet for teaching without a license, but as far as I know they do not offer a lateral entry program that leads to a license. Some charters also have teaching fellow positions where you train for a year before teaching your own classes. I had a license when I was applying, so I do not know a lot about the requirements for those positions. I am not sure how much it costs, but a few of my colleagues and my old boss are getting master's degrees from the RELAY program. For people without a license, you get placed as a teaching fellow (not a lucrative position, but the pay is better than nothing) for your first year. The second year you will teach your own classes and wrap up coursework. Edit: I looked it up and you would need to be offered one of the teaching fellow positions at a charter school first, then you can apply to the RELAY teaching fellow MAT program. If you were asking in November instead of March I would tell you to apply to the MAT program at Duke. They have several fellowships including one from the NIH that will pay for your master's degree.

highschoolteachers,"I got my first teaching license in Colorado so I can speak a little about the requirements of a license from there and the steps that I took to get it. I took the traditional pathway (university degree in my subject + certification and student teaching from my university's school of education) whereas a relative of mine took the alternative pathway (teaching &amp; getting your education credentials at the same time). If you are more interested in the alternative pathway option--which it sounds like you are--then you should first be looking around for job postings. In order to get into an alternative pathway program, you firs have to be hired on as a teacher. Schools are/will soon be posting their job openings. Most will be posted by spring break time. Instead of contacting the universities, I would contact the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) with your questions as they will be more readily knowledgeable about your options. Their website is also pretty easy to navigate and understand. Here is a good start: https://www.cde.state.co.us/cdeprof/altteacheroverview There is usually a demand for science teachers and if you look on teachers-teachers.com (a good job search site) there is quite a lot of science postings for Colorado.

highschoolteachers,"Alright. Job prospects are good. We need science teachers. Are you willing/able to teach something other than biology? Chem? Physics? The more you are certified to teach, the better. But biology is 1,000 times better than if you were certified to teach history or English. You will need to take the MTELs. You will, at the least, have to take the Literacy &amp; Communication (or called similar) and the Biology one. If you think you can pass another science, go for it. You pass the MTELs and you have your masters I think you can actually apply for your initial, over your preliminary. The SEI endorsement is new. I have been teaching 11 years in MA and I do not have it. I *just* renewed my license (good for five years) in January of this year. Because they just rolled out the SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) in the last few years, they are trying to get everyone certified. New graduates take a class and they are set. Current teachers take a class and they are set -- but they are offering the classes first to teachers at schools with ELL populations. My school does not have any (on record - we have them but they choose not to identify) so we are low priority. I cannot get into a class - yet. In order to renew, I needed 15 hours in an ELL course, so I took something online over the summer to get the hours so I could renew. I have to take the course in the next five years in order to renew, but because I am still in that grey area where current teachers are not yet certified, I was okay to renew and my school was okay with that. It is a requirement, but depending on the school, not necessarily a deal breaker. Alternatively, you could take the SEI MTEL. I had a friend do that. She passed, but I heard it is a pretty low pass rate. You could always try. Take the MTELs. Apply for licensure. Preliminary or Initial, it will not matter. You will end up with your professional in five years. I graduated with a bachelor's and an initial license. I have a coworker who graduated with a preliminary (not an ed program, no student teaching), got a masters, and now has an initial. I do not think you can start with a professional, unless you have the three years experience in another state, but you can certainly go to college in PA and get a teacher license in MA. Again I am 90% sure you can get your initial, even without the SEI, but you **have** to take the MTELs. My MTEL advice is for high school by the way.

highschoolteachers,This happened to my district twice when I was going through school. One year I was in elementary school and the proposal was to pay for buses. That was voted down so my elementary school determined only people who lived more than two miles from the school would get a bus. I was 1.9 miles. One house on my street could use the bus. The rest of us had to walk.... on a bridge that went over a highway... to elementary school. We had three months of carpools before the district was able to provide buses for everyone. The second time I was in 7th or 8th grade and the sports and arts departments were hit. We had to pay a crazy high fee to play sports or participate in after school music (band/orchestra/chorus). Also they closed the middle and high school libraries. You could only go with a class. There was no librarian. Looking back I guess it was better than cutting teachers and having oversized classrooms.,happened district twice going one year proposal pay bus voted determined people lived two mile would get bus mile one house street could use bus rest u walk bridge went highway three month carpools district able provide bus everyone second time the the grade sport art department hit pay crazy fee play sport participate music band orchestra chorus also closed library could go class librarian looking back guess better cutting teacher oversized classroom
highschoolteachers,"I have such a love/hate relationship with helicopter parents. They are always there if you need them to do something, but they also complain and criticize non-stop. You need to set up some type of boundaries. For example, they can only meet with you before or after school during certain times. It is also okay to tell them they need to schedule such a meeting. Once I was tenured, I started to tell some of these parents what was on my mind (Example: your child is failing my class because they are not doing any homework. I did not contact you because they are a senior in high school and need to take responsibility for their grades. You also have 24/7 access to updated grades if you would like to keep an eye on their progress). I have only had to say this once to my worst helicopter mom. With the other parents, I have let them know that I have their child's best interests at heart. I will contact them if something comes up, otherwise no news is good news. I am always sure to compliment them on their kid's progress when I see them. I think these parents get worried that they are not doing enough to make sure their child succeeds.

highschoolteachers,"Not the op but did not your kids teachers send out something at the beginning of the year explaining the homework policy? It is really not reasonable to ask the teachers to email you specifically whenever homework is assigned. Also at 10th &amp; 8th grade they really are old enough to be keeping track of their homework - why do not you check their agendas/planners to see if they are writing things down &amp; then doing them. If they do not have or use an agenda, then perhaps you should start enforcing that? Every school in my area hands one out to the students at the beginning of the year. Out of my 80 or so 9th graders, maybe 10 of my students have parents who check their agendas. In fact many of the students do not bother to hang onto their planners &amp; by high school it certainly is reasonable to ask them to keep an eye on their things (&amp; they never seem to lose their headphones or phones so I know they can keep track of smaller things if they try). I also give my students other options if they find a paper agenda too hard to use - for example some of my ADD students do better with google calendar since they always have their phone on them &amp; it can send them alerts. If your kids are having trouble consistently using their agenda, perhaps you can ask their teachers to sign off on it at the end of each class - that way you know they have shown it to their teacher who can tell them if they have written down the correct homework.

highschoolteachers,"The big problem as a parent is that I often have no idea when there is homework. The elementary, middle, and high schools my kids have gone to have all changed their homework policies from year to year, with one year having no homework at all, another year having homework only on Fridays, another year having homework only for what is not finished in class, and so forth. I cannot keep up as a parent and am incredibly frustrated with trying to figure out if my kid has homework or not. If they bring things home, I can generally catch it, but I do not always catch it. And, if they do not bring things home, I do not know if that means they do not have homework or just did not bring it home. I now have two 10th graders and an 8th grader, and I still cannot figure out on a regular basis if they are doing their work until the teacher decides to update their parent portal for me to see the 0's. And, considering some teachers update daily, some weekly, and some at the end of the six weeks, it can again be hard to find out. I will say, having had three kids go through 5th grade, that if you are relying on the students to get everything done and not communicating with the parents about what needs to be done, then things are going to fall through the cracks. As a parent (and an educator myself), I need to know what is going on, so the other suggestions here of a weekly email or class website that updates me on what is going on is extraordinarily helpful. And, as someone who teaches college students now, I smile at the idea that a 5th grader needs to be held responsible and accountable for their work when I cannot even get college students to complete the work they are supposed to do. So, I am not trying to attack you, as you have not given much information here as to what the situation is, but if you are shutting out the parents from the conversation, then the parents are sitting at home fuming about how the teacher never communicates with them. In elementary school (and middle school), the parents should still be an active part of their child's education, and, if you are turning down requests from parents to know what is going on with their child's education, then that is not good.",big problem parent often idea homework school kid gone changed homework policy year year one year homework another year homework friday another year homework finished class forth cannot keep parent incredibly frustrated trying figure kid homework bring thing home generally catch always catch bring thing home know mean homework bring home two the grader the grader still cannot figure regular basis work teacher decides update parent portal see considering teacher update daily weekly end six week hard find say three kid go the grade relying student get everything done communicating parent need done thing going fall crack parent educator need know going suggestion weekly email class website update going extraordinarily helpful someone teach college student smile idea the grader need held responsible accountable work cannot even get college student complete work supposed trying attack given much information situation shutting parent conversation parent sitting home fuming teacher never communicates parent still active part child education turning request parent know going child education good

highschoolteachers,"I cannot speak for secondary teachers in general, but for me: yes, I strongly prefer to teach 11th and 12th graders due to their increased maturity and decreased behavior issues. In high school (at least in my district), grade level promotion is tied to course credits. If a student does not have enough credits to qualify for the next grade level, s/he does not move up. This means that students with severe behavioral issues tend to repeat 9th and/or 10th grade at least once, resulting in an increased concentration of challenging behavior in those courses.

Have a great classroom management plan and stick to it is the biggest advice I can give. They said they think I am late 20's early 30's.

I put a stamp or star on lots of things because I just glance at,mostly practice stuff or things we just learned.

Assessments are short because numbers do not prove mastery,as long as they mastered it,who cares if they do ten or thirty? Also,scheduling is so important. Today is Tuesday,so I am going to be creating next week lesson plan and filling out any paperwork I have. Tomorrow is Wednesday so I am going to be editing and finalizing any work for next week.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school mathematics. And no. It is not too early. The number one indication of whether or not a specific student will drop out of high school is whether or not they pass Algebra 1. I have been frustrated that elementary schools teach students ""tricks"" and ""rules"" for ""the basics"" that do not translate in to higher mathematics. Students get frustrated that what they have been taught is wrong, and they have to relearn everything they thought they knew. So why not start off right from the beginning? An example. When you divide, you always divide the small number into the big number. Until you learn about fractions. When you subtract, the small number is taken away from the big number. Until you learn about negative numbers. The equal sign means this is the answer. Until you learn about equations. Trust me, they are doing your niece a big favor. She is not dumb. But I would rather not have to unteach ""the basics"" when she gets to high school, and it will be easier for her if she does not have to unlearn ""the basics."" Think of mathematics as a whole instead of chunking it into grade levels. She has to learn algebra eventually. Why not start with something simple, like a basic equation now. That way she will not have to unlearn everything her elementary teachers taught her in middle and high school. If she can do 3+2= and get 5, why should not she be able to do 3+2=x therefore x=5.

highschoolteachers,"There is nothing you can do that is not punitive. In all seriousness, college is not high school. I do not even check textbooks out to my students. We do not used them. We may have cracked the textbook twice last year. Students have got to know that in college, which is different from high school, you have to read the text. And the only way they can learn that is to fail at something. Every student goes to college thinking that they have done school for 12-15 years, and they have got this. Every student figures out at some point that college is ***different***. You cannot convince an 18 year old that they do not know everything - believe me, I have tried. They have got to learn that for themselves. Here is what I would do. I would not tell them it is a good idea to read the text before class, I would require it. I would not start class with a lecture. I would start class by cold calling some students and asking them questions about the reading. That will make it abundantly clear that they should have read something before coming to class. And embarrass the shit out of them when they have not read it.

highschoolteachers,"You have got an interesting question here. I think you will find that most American high schools are cutting back on what are seen as ""elective"" classes these days, and for the most part, do not have psychology classes on offer. What that means for you is that it is unlikely that you will be hired by a district primarily to teach psych. Instead, it may be a course that you can offer beyond a major subject like social studies or English Language Arts. In my NYC high school, for the first time this year, we have a full time psych teacher, but her course will fulfill English requirements for seniors and some juniors. I would recommend that you get your bachelor's degree in psych (and double major in education if possible), get a masters in teaching, and then work towards certification in a major subject.

highschoolteachers,"I think the point you made about teaching high school students who were raised on a formulaic approach with the new core standards based curriculum is really important. The education field is in a huge time of transition and change (I AM GOING TO) and our students in high school math courses are caught in the middle, and thus, a whole lot more likely to actively resist the change in type of instruction because their math learning expectations, habits, and attitudes are quite set already. I have seen this played out in my classroom over the last couple of school years in Algebra I and Geometry as I began teaching using CC curriculum. It is definitely a change that, to be implemented properly and sustainably, requires a lot of extra thought, time, effort, and coaching of students and parents on the part of the teacher. Then again, that is the key with most ""fads"" in education, I think.

highschoolteachers,"/you/TablesAreUsuallyFlat gives a lot of good info. One thing I want to add is that private schools are a different story from public schools. The certification that is required for public schools is not a requirement for private ones. It often helps, of course, but the state-to-state thing is less of an issue. I teach at a private school and hold a credential for a different state (the state where I went to college). I will be honest - it is a difficult job market for beginning teachers in general. Even if you were a US citizen, with your limited experience you would probably need to apply to lots of schools before finding a job. I do not mean that to discourage you; rather, I want to encourage you to keep up the hunt even if it does not come quickly. Sorry I do not have any first-hand info to pass on. The closest thing is that I had an Australian physics teacher in high school (at a private school). However, he a) had a PhD, which I am sure helped his candidacy and b) may have already been married to his American wife when he started at the school.",tablesareusuallyflat give lot good info one thing want add private school different story public school certification required public school requirement private one often help course state state thing le issue teach private hold credential different state state went college honest difficult job market beginning teacher general even u citizen limited experience would probably need apply lot school finding job mean discourage rather want encourage keep hunt even come quickly sorry first hand info pas closest thing australian physic teacher private however pod sure helped candidacy i may already married american wife started

highschoolteachers,"I am an undergrad (and not an education major) but I hope to be a teacher someday. I have always had quite a few teachers I really looked up to...usually math/science/language teachers. In junior high I thought my math teacher was the coolest person ever, so naturally I wanted to become a math teacher. When I got to high school, I had two amazing science teachers. Then I wanted to teach science (chem or physical science). Now in college, I had an organic chemistry professor who is probably the best teacher I have ever had. This guy cares about students so much, and truly wants them to succeed. He will answer any questions students throw at him, even when they are not in his classes anymore. On top of that, he is hilarious. I have never met a student of his who did not love him. So...after I finished ochem, I began tutoring it through my university's free tutoring program. I had never had so much fun. I did it as much as I could. I met great people and learned so much. It was fun to watch my students do well in their classes (often better than I had done!) and I loved hearing their excitement about a great test score or whatever. This semester, I am a TA for my organic professor's class. It is the coolest thing for me. During training, all the new TAs (1st year grad students and me) had to do a practice discussion for the group and some experienced TAs/lecturers. Mine was about stuff I had learned in his classes, and he was there watching. After I finished, he said something like, ""When you showed [important chem topic], I was so proud."" That feel. I will never forget it. There is just something awesome about helping people learn and seeing their faces light up when they figure something out. There is not a better feeling in the world.

highschoolteachers,"Warning wall of text(side effect of being an English teacher) The kid is old enough to know that he has an issue, so make sure you educate him on how to handle it. Ask him what he wants to do after high school. Explain that in the real adult world you cannot disrupt meetings, cannot be the class clown, so he needs coping skills to live with his ADHD. Then explain that you are going to start coaching him on how to handle his ADHD and be productive. These are the things that I use with my ADHD kids: They run all of my errands. If they need to get out and walk off some energy, I will make up a pre arragend errand with another teacher so they know that I have a kid just walking off energy. They are the classroom helpers. If they need to stand to work, they can, as long as the do not bother anyone When they are having a really bad day, they let me know ahead of time and take a few min to gain control, go get water, or make a lap around campus. Caffeine. Where I teach many of the families do not have consistent access to health care, or cannot afford medicine. Most of the ADHD meds are stimulants, so caffeine can help calm them down. I tell the students to ask their parents about having a soda or coffee in the morning. Also, morning exercise is helpful. I also have them reflect about their ADHD behavior and see if they can figure out their triggers and what works for them. It is much harder with 9th graders, but can be done. With all of these things, lots and lots of praise when they complete the task, and work well in class. Lots of reflection, talking with the kid, ask how they are doing in other classes, have the student share what works well in your class with other teachers. Make him aware of his progress, and share the success with his parents. And email his coach about how much he has become a great helper in your class and how well he is working. This will make the kid love you and he will do whatever you want. Teaching is mostly building the relationships with kids so they respect you, once you have that, then you can teach the content.

Nearly all of the stories were new to everyone there, including his mom, but well-known within school. Not all the stories were flattering!

My own kids are in a small K-8 school without differentiated learning. So the only thing within the school that matters is whether they progress to the next grade level. In the transition to high school, incoming students from my kids' K-8 school are placed into high school courses based on teacher recommendation.

In the second half of the fall semester we did all of our field observation hours (100 hours required in the semester) with the teachers that we will be student teaching with, which helps a lot. I know the students, ahead of time, I know the content I will be teaching, already, and we have been working on EdTPA style learning segments. I was also able to make a very good impression with both teachers and have taught some of their lessons to the classes at this point. They have both told me that I can use as much or as little of their materials as I want, though there are mandated assessments that I have to teach to in my second placement. I will definitely use some of the material from my first CT, but I am not a huge fan of how much my second CT dumbs the material down for her classes (they get very bored and act up, among other issues). It is a high school science class, afterall. The science EdTPA does have a bit of crossover with other EDTPA formats, you are correct. We have to have a lot of focus on inquiry-based learning. We have a local, national board certified, science teacher teaching our methods courses and a seminar next semester where we work on improving our teaching and work on our EdTPA materials. She has been a tremendous help and emphasized using the EdTPA language and following the rubric, as well. I have definitely kept all of my textbooks and will (and have, already) use them while planning. Did you use the Woolfolk Ed Psych book, by chance? We are a very close-knit group in our program (there are only 5 of us, now), so we will definitely be doing a lot peer-review and probably some peer-counseling, as well, lol.",thank encouragement accelerated month master program bachelor biology minor chemistry part nervousness feeling program semester count summer winter one semester pedagogy course student teaching whole semester two placement spring feel well prepared however second half fall semester field observation hour hour required semester teacher student teaching help lot know student ahead time know content teaching already working extra style learning segment also able make good impression teacher taught lesson class point told use much little material want though mandated assessment teach second placement definitely use material first it huge fan much second it dumbs material class get bored act among issue science class adderall science extra bit crossover extra format correct lot focus inquiry based learning local national board certified science teacher teaching method course seminar next semester work improving teaching work extra material tremendous help emphasized using extra language following rubric well definitely kept textbook already use planning use woolfolk ed psych book chance close knit group program u definitely lot peer review probably peer counseling well lol

highschoolteachers,"1) Why poetry? I was an English major all throughout my undergrad, and Poetry just happens to be something my MT was dreading to do since she is not much of a fan - she was originally going to wait until near the end of the year to do poetry, but because of my own background with English and talking with her about what lessons I would be interested in teaching she decided a unit on poetry would be a good fit for me, and I agree. I am honestly not too sure what we want them to learn, she really just told me I would be doing a poetry unit all on my own, and said she would look over the final assignment (since I had to create about 4 different final assignments due to the varied learners in our class). 2) I mostly plan to push the whole ""We are going to have a literary cafe at the end with snacks and hot chocolate it is going to be great!"" - i do not really have much of a plan but am banking on the fact that they seem to like me enough to be interested in what I am going to do with them. For every poetry type I do plan to give them topics to write their poems on (for Haiku I was going to get them to write a haiku about vampires), and pick fun topics for each type of poem (I plan to show them Daniel Radcliffe's cover of Blackalicious' Alphabet Aerobics because I am a huge HP fan *and* he censors out the N word). I do not have too much experience being in front of a class and teaching, so I was hoping my prompts and giving them interesting topics for their poems would be enough to get them/keep them interested. 3) I chose to do alliterative before acrostic because I personally feel acrostic is easier to do, and I just threw it in last minute because I thought it was a fun form of poetry the kids could learn and have fun with, as opposed to Alliterative because alliteration is important to know when you hit high school.

highschoolteachers,"I love raccoontrashfires ideas. That is a great schedule. I would add these ideas for your consideration as well. 1. Get your principal to sign off buying books. You need sets of high interest nonfiction texts at these kids levels. You need good books from which you can plan good lessons. Using other sources from time to time is great, but you need books. Especially if you have to fill four hours a week!!!!! National Geographic has awesome books. Cannot think off the top of my head where else we have books from in our book room, but you can probably find good ones on Amazon. I often buy sets for my classroom on Amazon and get reimbursed. 2. Can you also add a test taking strategies component, or is that going to fall into the helping with schoolwork category? I have done tutoring after school with my students and one aspect was test prep. We would do a sample passage as a group in a guided format (I would model as they followed along and gave suggestions about what to do next). Then we did questions together. Usually we would focus on one skill per week because we had a short time frame. 3. Fluency. My kids really need this as they are often more than one grade level below. Since you have some well below grade level, I Am guessing their fluency even at that level is probably pretty low. I would hit this hard for 10-15 minutes each time. You can do timed repeated readings of a text (one of their books or if you have access to something like Reading A to Z, they have leveled fluency passages). Reading A to Z also has a wide range of leveled books you can download (I would think their highest level hits 9th grade, but someone can correct me if I Am wrong.). It is a paid subscription, though, that you would want school to pick up. Or you can try to find readers theaters, if the kids go for it and are not too cool for that at that age. There Is a lot of research about the connection between fluency and overall reading growth. Again, I do not know how you would do it with high school kids. Use your own judgment there. I Am coming at it from a lower grade, but I have had great success with my tutoring program (but I typically tutored my kids and kids on my grade level team who I knew very well). We tracked their data weekly and my teammates helped give suggestions for plans as I went along depending on how the kids were doing.

Let us be honest here, here are plenty of shady private colleges that would literally accept anybody.(And that is where most of my students would end up if they are going to college. ) When they go to college, they would be stuck in remedial courses they could not pass in high school. (They could not even pass algebra 1 STAAR exam.) By the end of their college, they would only pile themselves on predatory student loan without being attaining education/training to pay it back.

highschoolteachers,"When I subbed high school I would tell the kids who were off task to at least pretend like you are working....that way it a teacher comes in it looks like I Am doing my job. The kids thought it was funny and would end up doing some of their work. I think it worked because it put myself and the student on a the same team rather than me vs. them. You could sit behind them so you can always see their screen. An English teacher at my school rearranges the desks so everyone is facing the wall so she can see all screens at any time. Also, facing the wall means there are fewer inadvertent distractions.

highschoolteachers,"Yes, you CAN have actual discussions, however you will also have to accept that the majority of your time teaching will not be waxing poetic about life. There are so many standards that you must address and so many responsibilities that will leave you feeling disillusioned about your summer camp and college orientation experiences. You will have to teach them how to write, and some will still be confusing your and you are, two, to, and too, and why ""irregardless"" is redundant. Actually, you will have to explain what it means to be redundant. You will have to show them how to organize the word vomit coming out of their brains as they try to form their own opinion. You will have to convince a high school student with a 7th grade reading level to engage with Fahrenheit 451. These are just a minuscule portion of what an English teacher is responsible for covering. If your plan is to do more lecturing as a way of leading students to an AHA! moment, then no, it is not realistic. If you think books will be the window into each student's soul, then you will find yourself extremely frustrated. You will get so excited at a certain point in a story, and some of your students will stare back with stoicism. You are going to have to be willing to be hands-on, differentiate your instruction for varying levels, make your content relatable and relevant, while also providing rigor. Teaching is no joke, and it is difficult. If you are willing to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty, it is an amazingly rewarding job.

highschoolteachers,"Many middle schools like to have one teacher for both subjects to give the kids a bit more of an elementary-school-like environment, with less moving around between classes and between teachers. Especially for sixth grade (or whatever the youngest middle school grade is in the district; it can vary). In the part of California where I grew up they moved sixth grade from elementary to middle school about 15 years ago (I was in high school at the time), and they put a lot of these types of things in place to alleviate concerns that sixth graders were not ready for a full-on, different teacher every class middle school environment. At the (private, 6-12) school where I currently teach, we have one teacher for both English and History in the sixth grade; she is the only teacher at the school who has a multiple-subject credential, while everyone else has either a single-subject or an advanced degree in their subject area.

highschoolteachers,"So I just found out that I did not get a job that I was really hopeful about. I do not even know what to do, so I am just going to rant a bit and maybe someone can give me some advice. If not, maybe it will at least make me feel better to type it all out. At the end of my MAT (2016) I was offered a job by the school I had student taught at (and been hired at for the second half of the year, long story), but I turned it down for a job at a charter school in the town I grew up. I loved the school I student taught at, but I just thought it would be so great to teach in the community where I went to school. That charter school ended up being a truly horrific experience and I resigned before the end of October, 2016. Every teacher I knew (including all of my supervisors from grad school, who I trust very much) told me that I needed to get my ass out of there AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so I did. I spent the next three months depressed, feeling very sorry for myself, and regretting leaving my previous school. Then I found a long term job at a really great high school for the last four months of the 2016-17 school year. Last summer, a job was posted at the middle school in the same district and everyone I knew at the district told me to apply. They all sent over great references for me, including the principal and assistant principal. I got an interview, went through the whole interview process there, and did not get the job. The principal told me that I was their second choice, and that they just went with someone with more middle school experience. (I did not have any middle school experience because I never got to do my middle school practicum... because I accepted the job at the first school I had worked at.) I learned later that my principal at the high school was really upset that they did not hire me and there was some internal drama because of it. For every interview I had last summer (and I did not have many, because there were so few ELA jobs posted at all), each principal told me that I was their second choice. I always asked if there was something I could do to improve and everyone has told me no, that everything I did was great, but that they were just going with someone with more experience. So, I ended up getting another long term sub job for this year in the same district that I taught at last year, and I split my time between the same high school I taught at last year and the middle school that turned me down. I started in October and will finish out the year with these same kids. I love my kids so much but this job has been really isolating and difficult, partly because I am teaching a subject that I have never taught before. Additionally, many people that I work with have made it very clear that I am temporary and that they are not interested in creating any sort of relationship with me. It is all been really lonely and I was questioning whether or not I even wanted to teach any more. I finally decided that I really just wanted to find a place where I am teaching language arts and have a permanent position. I do not want to give up on this profession that I used to be so passionate about just because I have not had good experiences since that first year. Anyway, in the past month I have been going through this extensive hiring process for a school that I love. Everything was going really really well and it totally seemed like a place where I could finally put down roots. I did my lesson observation for them last Friday, and sent in my post-lesson reflection on Monday. I was not happy with my lesson, but I was still kind of hopeful. Unfortunately, the principal just called me and guess what? I was their second choice and they went with someone with more experience. He said that they were really impressed with me and that I beat out internal candidates, and said that there was not anything that I did that I could improve on. I am just feeling so discouraged. I have applied to every single job posted in the metropolitan area I live in... but there are fewer than 10 ELA jobs that have been posted. I have only been called by that one school, almost every other position has been filled. I feel like I am going to be passed up by every school for someone with more experience. I feel like I am just going to be stuck with another long term sub job next year where everyone treats me like a second class citizen. I guess I do not know why I am even typing all of this out. Maybe someone else has dealt with the same kind of thing? Maybe there is hope for me yet?

highschoolteachers,"When I came to my current district, it was late in the hiring season (late June) that we moved here and I did not want to fuck around. I had taught Title 1 before so I went to one of the better Title 1 middle schools in the district, which seemed rough but well-organized, and put my resume in front of the principal. I had applied online to all that was open in the district, and I got a bunch of calls, but I already had a job by the time the calls came in. I got one the same day I walked in (not the contract yet or anything but the offer was basically made). They needed 4 English teachers, I had proven experience in a Title 1 and clearly knew my stuff. I worked there for awhile until the district decided to take over the school and micromanage the teachers, then I jumped for a single year to an A middle school. I applied the normal way and chose the first lifeline. I did not want to go through another ""School Success"" year with the district bullshit because I happened to teach poor kids that did not test well. I was always watching for openings at the high school I currently work at. An AP who worked with me at the Title 1 moved there the year I left the Title 1. He told me there was an opening the year I came over. That is how I got my current position. It is the best HS in the district -- great community, good admin, A school, suburban style community, IB and AP programs galore, etc. As a first year teacher, I would say, take whatever you are offered unless it comes with MAJOR red flags. You can move around in a district once you have tenure or even before in many cases, if it is really bad.

Unless you REALLY love the kids you currently have or really love teaming, which is really the biggest benefit of middle school, I think you should go to high school. The behavioral management is easier, the content is deeper, and you can still teach however you want as long as you hit all the stuff that is on your EOC and teach the content. Unless the EOC is really bad (it is FL, so possible, I do not know that exam, but Bio seems hard to screw up), the content on it is probably just the standards you would have to cover anyway. To me, you sound like a high school teacher. There are people who prefer middle school, but that is not how you sound to me here. It is a tiny snippet of you, though, so hard to say for sure.

Pros MS: still very silly and willing to be silly in class, which can be very fun with labs and such. Very easy to manage and still interested in your opinion as the teacher. They are still excited to do new things and this might be their first chance at life science. You have created the curriculum and get to coteach, which is so much better for student learning and teacher job satisfaction. More parental support, less student apathy. Pros HS; they are more adult but still can be silly if you approach it right. They can take it more seriously since it is now units and not just promotion. They have a higher capacity for abstract thought. The material is what you have more experience with. End of course test could give you more feedback on what you need to improve over time.

highschoolteachers,"It really depends. Reasons why college classes are harder: 1.\) College professors generally are not trained in teaching, and often times do not want to be teaching. It is a ""chore"" for them to do that allows them to have a position that allows them to do research. Sometimes their idea of ""think critically"" is more like ""read my mind"" or ""know to look up this information that you have no idea exists."" TAs can be even worse because they are trying to make ends meat while trying to get research done. 2.\) Colleges do not care about you learning. \(Generally.\) They care about making sure a certain percentage of people pass the class, a certain percentage fail, and depending on the subject try to make ""passing"" have to do with some sort of standard set by some organization. Chemistry departments try to keep in line with the American Chemical Society, for example. 3.\) Colleges tend to have a ""eff you"" attitude. Have another class during office hours? Tough luck. No help for you. Given the crappy equipment in lab? Oh well, you get an F. 4.\) Everything costs money. And if anything goes wrong, it is YOUR fault. Does not matter if it actually is your fault, it is still your fault. Reasons why AP classes are harder: 1.\) Your instructor does not know what is going to be on the AP test. They have a general idea, but nothing specific. They do not have any input on it. 2.\) You are still considered a minor, and are given no control over your daily schedule. That worthless class that you could ditch everyday and still get an A? You have to go! It is the law...... 3.\) Generally, you have much less freedom of ""when"" or ""how"" to do homework. \(Although I can point to a few classes I had in college that were even more restrictive than high school.\) 4.\) You are in a smaller class, which means less likelihood of finding someone else with the same learning style as you to study with. 5.\) Generally, you do not have big blocks of time to retreat to the library and study for 5 hours straight.",really depends reason college class harder college professor generally trained teaching often time want teaching chore allows position allows research sometimes idea think critically like read mind know look information idea exists ta even worse trying make end meat trying get research done college care learning generally care making sure certain percentage people pas class certain percentage fail depending subject try make passing sort standard set organization chemistry department try keep line american chemical society example college tend eff attitude another class office hour tough luck help given crappy equipment lab oh well get i everything cost money anything go wrong fault matter actually fault still fault reason ap class harder instructor know going ap test general idea nothing specific input still considered minor given control daily schedule worthless class could ditch everyday still get go law generally much le freedom homework although point class college even restrictive smaller class mean le likelihood finding someone else learning style study generally big block time retreat library study hour straight

Second, on certain content I know there will be a lot of confusion and lack of confidence, so I preface these activities by saying ""Try these problems on your own without asking for help. After 10 minutes of silent, independent work, we will review together and you can ask any questions you would like"". I usually collect work before the review so that students are held accountable. With this routine, students start to feel confident in taking risks because they know in advance that they will eventually get to ask a question, or see that others have the same struggles. I give feedback and assess so I know who needs what in the next lessons.",lack independence group first set tone beginning year certain activity silent independent work cannot ask question reinforce expectation redirect student forget forget expectation week student fall routine second certain content know lot confusion lack confidence preface activity saying try problem without asking help minute silent independent work review together ask question would like usually collect work review student held accountable routine student start feel confident taking risk know advance eventually get ask question see others struggle give feedback ass know need next lesson
highschoolteachers,"This is a really long comment, and I have found no suitable ""tl;dr"" to put here. Sorry! I am considering a switch from a 30-year engineering career (in computer software and hardware) to teaching high school. This precise topic of ""teacher qualification"" has been very much on my mind this year, so I decided to test it by doing lots of volunteering at a local high school in multiple subject areas. First, there was a great need for math tutoring, so I started there. I am a VERY strong ""applied"" math person, emphasizing the practical over the theoretical. Which also means I lack much of the pedagogical. I took the 3 California CSET Math exams, and failed the first two because I had forgotten the NAMES of many of the axioms and theorems I used (with mastery) on a daily basis, meaning I would have trouble defining, explaining and linking individual concepts for students. I flipped through a 2-foot tall stack of high school math texts (algebra, geometry, trig, pre-calc) to gain a quick feel for what is presented in what order, how, and why. Fortunately, I was a tutor, not a teacher, and did not need to create or present lesson plans. I needed to see where and how a student was stuck, then find ways to either remove the block, fill in the gap, or navigate around it. I also worked with different math teachers, and was exposed to their sometimes surprisingly different approaches to the same material. This has worked wonders for me! The only time I fail with a math student is when there are external issues I cannot help address, but that preclude any focus on math. In such situations I try to provide a ""safe place"" where math *could* (not must) happen. I also became a TA in a CS class, an area in which I have deep and broad knowledge and experience, both theoretical and practical. This allowed me to have very different perspectives for both the teacher and the students. The CS teacher was pursuing rapid programming success without conceptual depth, a stark contrast to both what I had observed in the math classroom and to what I knew of the underpinnings of CS. This path is one many follow when trying to pick up programming on their own, and is well enshrined within the Maker community. Unfortunately, only about 10% of the students were succeeding on the first try, which to me seemed primarily due to pre-existing familiarity with computers and minor amounts of programming. The class had several students who promptly dropped it because of a massive lack of connection to the subject and/or the teaching approach. When I tutored the ""lost"" students, I embedded what the teacher had shared within a more math-like structure, defining concepts and showing relationships, but still within the context of developing the program in the lesson plan. For most (but not all) this worked quite well. The hardest, for me, was convincing students desiring to leave the course to stay. I had no clue how to engender the fascination and joy I experience from getting to do CS as a profession, beyond simply relating my own experiences (which does have value). For many of these students, it is a week-to-week negotiation to keep them trying, while I struggle to find motivational key(s) that will work better for them. This school also has a large hydroponic garden (with a tilapia pond providing fertilizer) that also has many conventional raised-beds and a small grove of fruit and nut trees. The goal is for it to become financially self-supporting by selling produce in local farmer's markets, and to provide situational education opportunities in many subject areas, including Economics, Project Management, Agriculture, Food Handling/Services, Retail, and so on. Several teachers support it, some by teaching relevant classes, and all with extensive time outside school. There is a lengthy wish list of tasks and goals that simply lack time and personnel to address, and I volunteered to attack some of them. First was to plumb in some sinks and a solar hot water heater, so the produce could be washed according to food handling standards, something that is required for the food to be legal to sell. I do my own plumbing mainly because it is fun, and I thought I could take a few students through the process while getting the work accomplished. Wow. Adding two students multiplied the schedule by over a factor of TEN! It took over a month just to get to the point of having a piping plan and a shopping list for Home Depot. It was clear to me that I had simultaneously managed to over-explain and under-teach, not to mention failing to move the project along. I shifted to an apprenticeship model, where I gave short work assignments with only the snippets of information needed to get that one job done. This worked far better, but meant I was doing much more of the work myself, since much of it did not break down at all well, especially the design work. Another garden project was to create an alarm system for the hydroponic aerator pumps: When they fail, the fish die within a few days, and the plants within a week. I had initially thought to bring in a couple of the CS students, but realized this would be well beyond their abilities to help move the project forward. So I did it myself, using an old cell phone that simply sent a text whenever its charger was not supplying power. I took careful notes, which I am turning into a series of lesson plans for future use, and to permit the system to be maintained and improved by others. This has been a MASSIVE amount of experience packed into 5 months of nearly full-time volunteering. In fact, I have found ZERO examples of anyone else pursuing such an immersive approach. (I am certain such folks exist, but they do not seem to post online.) I am still drawing many lessons from this, ever more as I discuss things with teachers and senior staff. But two items do rise to the top: 1. Subject matter expertise MATTERS! 2. Teaching strategies MATTER! Effectiveness in BOTH of these is based upon a combination of education and experience. In particular, I have found my stories from industry are almost always the first such stories the students have EVER heard. The professionals they know best, that is, those they see getting paid to use a college degree, are primarily teachers, and to a lesser extend law enforcement and emergency personnel. Even kids with professional parents often do not know what their parents ""really"" do! The #2 job category most students interact with are retail workers such as sales people, order takers and cashiers. That can only give them a very limited and non-representational perspective, greatly hindering their ability to meaningfully consider other career paths. We simply MUST get experienced professionals into STEM classrooms, if only to give students access to folks who have made their living in disciplines other than teaching. This adds one thing that folks with only subject degrees or minors lack: Industry experience. But this need NOT be a one-way street from industry to the classroom! There is nothing that prevents teachers with relevant degrees from getting some industry experience of their own to bring back to the classroom, starting with industrial work during summers or perhaps during a sabbatical year. Another thing I have learned from interviewing teachers is just how common it is for them to feel their education degrees did little to prepare them for the realities of the classroom and the profession of teaching. Deeper discussions reveal that they themselves experienced what many of their students experienced: Disconnection from the purpose and/or the content of their education classes. So, I also feel it is VITAL for all folks desiring to become teachers to put in substantial classroom time as a tutor and assistant, to help out but not be burdened with lesson planning and presentation, or even administrivia. To be able to observe and learn from both students and teachers, with plenty of time to think about it. I think volunteering is a great way to start, with pay reserved until they can fill specific jobs. Bottom line, the referenced article is 100% correct, despite its too-narrow focus. But it goes both ways, and applies to the art and science of teaching as well as to mastery and application of the subject areas. Certainly in STEM. But we take this implicitly in other subject areas: Who would accept a French teacher who could not speak French and had never spent serious time in a French-speaking area? Who would accept a music teacher who could not play? Yet we have science teachers who have never worked in a lab. Journalism teachers who have never filed a story. The list goes on. We need to bring the wider professional world into the classroom. And we need to get teachers out into that world then return.",really long comment found suitable to do put sorry considering switch year engineering career computer software hardware teaching precise

But in middle school, the boys are usually a bit behind that stage whereas many of the girls are starting to be there. This may be changing, but people sharing their experiences are not necessarily wrong. It also heavily depends on the setting.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; My college GPA was a 3.4, will this hinder me? I am currently teaching at a public high school. I do not think that will be an issue. If I recall, in my program you had to have a minimum 3.0 GPA. When I was younger, I did not take academics as seriously as I do now, so my cumulative undergraduate GPA was only 3.25 and I was admitted without issue. WGU is more geared towards admitting working professionals into their graduate-level programs than most universities are. If you apply, you will be assigned an enrollment counselor and complete an intake interview. During that time, they are more interested in your credentials, future plans, and professional experience as an educator than what you did as an undergraduate/pre-teaching. You will be required to submit a copy of your state teaching credential, any prior professional/subject score reports, transcripts, and any program specific documentation to show proof of your certification/employment status as a teacher. Also, forgot to add, since you mentioned about finances. They have numerous scholarships available for teachers, too, which is great. They range from $500-$2,000, so if you apply and are awarded one that will take a chunk out of your potential debt. Last time I spoke with my academic advisor (program mentor), I believe she said that the next upcoming scholarship application deadline is June 30th. They do have a policy that you have to apply at least a month in advance of the term you want to begin. The enrollment and admission folks are extremely polite and timely about getting things together. Financial aid on the other hand, will take awhile. They work at a glacial pace.",it college gpa hinder currently teaching public think issue recall program minimum gpa younger take academic seriously cumulative undergraduate gpa admitted without issue gu geared towards admitting working professional graduate level program university apply assigned enrollment counselor complete intake interview time interested credential future plan professional experience educator undergraduate pre teaching required submit copy state teaching credential prior professional subject score report transcript program specific documentation show proof certification employment status teacher also forgot add since mentioned finance numerous scholarship available teacher great range apply awarded one take chunk potential debt last time spoke academic advisor program mentor believe said next upcoming scholarship application deadline june the policy apply least month advance term want begin enrollment admission folk extremely polite timely getting thing together financial aid hand take awhile work glacial pace

I have gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and cannot say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you were not friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, let us companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that is trickling out, now). So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is ""I do not have it, here is why,"" because you not only answer the question in a way they cannot wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

One...I think some classes that have gone out recently got into mischief. Kids sneaking off to vape, kids getting in fights. Two...another local high school in our district had a student with a loaded gun on campus last week. With the Texas shooting still fresh, safety is legitimately becoming a concern.

highschoolteachers,"There is nothing toxic or institutional about the culture of my classroom or my school. This is the same school that I graduated from many years ago.

When I was in high school, I am sure *we* were crazy by this time of year too. In fact, I know we were. Not because the school or teachers were driving us crazy, but because we were teenagers in the spring ready for summer vacation.

Interestingly, what prompted my post was that I *did* go off-script and try to teach a more engaging and thought-provoking lesson. Some of them just were not interested. They no longer want to be engaged. They do not want to participate or even appear to care at this point. Students who are normally very upbeat and enthusiastic were whining and/or indifferent.

highschoolteachers,"This is when you take the time to TEACH about diversity, which also includes disabilities. As a physically disabled woman who was an IEP student from the time I was seven and in a wheelchair in elementary school, kids asked why I got to go up the elevator to the second floor of the school and no one else did. \(It was a locked one that was never used except for 2 kids who happened to be in wheelchairs: myself and another boy who was years older than me.\) So for years I was the only person who used the elevator in an entire elementary school. I was also able to wear sandals, because I am unable to wear actual shoes. In addition, I was able to miss as many days of school as needed, due to my many different medical problems. Turn in assignments late \(this RARELY happened\). If I told the teacher I needed to leave, I was able to leave and head to the nurse at any time and they had to call my mom if I asked and she would come get me. \(I was really good at reading my body and knowing when I needed to be home. I also could go to the office at any time during recess or lunch to call my mom just to talk to her \(due to all the anxiety all of my medical issues from birth on had caused me to have. If I was able to talk to her at lunch, it was easier for me to stay at school.\) The calling her at lunch just to talk stopped inn 5th grade. My medical conditions are all invisible to the naked eye. When looking at me I look like a completely healthy 26 year old and then I looked like a completely healthy 6\+ child. My whole life teachers, doctors, strangers, guys I have dated and even friends have assumed that I am faking my illnesses from anything from attention to pain medication \(when having to go to the ER\) often without the chance to explain. As a young child people thought I wanted attention or did not really know what I was talking about. As a teenager and young adult people thought I stole my handicap placard and am a drug seeker. Despite missing more days of school than I attended, every semester, up until the second semester of freshman year I got a 4.0 GPA and never missed an assignment. I never got in trouble for behavioral issues, and rarely used my ""late assignment"" accommodation even when I was in the hospital. After the first semester of Freshman year I did independent study and graduated from high school a year and a half early with a perfect 5.0 \(weighted\) 4.0 \(unweighted\) GPA and got multiple scholarship offers. Through my education before college although I encountered many people whole did not believe in me I got very lucky with a certain handful of people who did: my teachers. I will always be grateful and forever blessed for every single one of my 6 elementary school teachers \(I had the same 4th and 5th grade teacher, my favorite actually\). They taught me to love school even though I was terrified to be away from my mother. I always loved learning and they all taught me that I could find people that would not make me feel different. They made me believe that I actually could not do things everyone else could do.. I could not go run around at recess but I could learn to do things in a different way and that is just as good. They did not make me feel like they judged me based on my accommodations \(even if they did, they did not make me FEEL like they did\) they made me feel like every other kid, and that is all I wanted. First I went to a college that was amazing with accommodations. I did a semester there but it was to far from home. I got really bad health wise and I was only 16. I could not even go to the doctor alone. So I transferred to a different school. I had to drop out of college because when I became epileptic in my 20s during my junior year I lost a lot of my cognitive ability and the head of the office for students with disabilities already \(before I was epileptic\) already was extremely unhelpful. She often compared me to other disabled students, saying stuff along the lines of ""xxxx gets headaches and she does xxxx, so you can too."" I fought like hell to get the accommodations I needed to no avail. I had never needed them for my academics, just for physical needs, not for extra testing time, etc. Now I did, I had the diagnosis, I had the doctors notes, but I now had a director that did not believe it me. So I had to leave. \(After leaving I ended up with a 2 year memory gap and having to relearn most things, could not hold a conversation, and my brain will never work the same but I am much much better so I probably would have had to leave anyway, but I lost my scholarship because I was gone for too long with both things together.\) YES, STUDENTS AND PARENTS RIG THE SYSTEM. THEY ALWAYS WILL. But the way I see it, I would rather multiple students GET accommodations that they DO NOT need, than ONE student NOT get accommodations that they DO need. So sorry for the long post but this hits so close to my heart. For what to say when one child asks why another kid is doing something. I guess it would depend on whether the class knows about the students IEP and disability. Every year at the beginning of the school year I would do a presentation on my main disability: RSD/CRPS. It helped a lot. I was not shrouded in mystery. I never had teasing or picking on me. There were stares and stuff but once I answered questions, like I did with the presentation, all that stopped. Maybe an idea to spread for any handicap kids in your classes.

The only thing that makes me lean one way or the other is that the first days of school was written in - was it the late 90s or the early 2000s? Whenever it was written- I was in elementary school. So its possible that the kids we are seeing now may respond to different strategies.

highschoolteachers,"I am an engineer on his path toward teaching, and a couple years ago I was volunteering at a school that lost two teachers in two months (November and December) for the same reason: Each was pregnant, had complications, and was placed on mandatory bed-rest. The school had excellent subs, but none wanted to fill-in once the new semester started. It was a small ""continuation"" high school, so other teachers were not rushing to transfer in. A frantic recruitment effort did yield two acceptable candidates, but only one accepted the offer. Fortunately, that teacher's mother had recently retired from teaching, and decided to join her son on the new job! I had never seen two teachers get better support at all levels. It did not hurt that the teachers on bed-rest were always willing to pitch in (which was desperately needed, as each was the only one teaching their subjects).

highschoolteachers,"1/ Districts: there are something like 850 districts in Illinois. It is not at all unusual for a mid size town to have 2-3 elementary districts (EC/K-8) and then feed into 1-2 high school districts and then there is often a separate special ed district on top of that. One school districts are also not unusual. (""I should get an administrator and superintendent's license"" may have just gone off in your head). The closer in to Chicago the more prevalent this nonsense is. That said, Chicago city (CPS) is one big district. 2/ Job portals are k12jobspot and IASBO. There are also job postings on Regional Boards of Ed websites. There is no consistency to how jobs are posted so make your search broad. I would also bookmark and regularly check the districts you are interested in as postings do not always make it to jobspot etc in a timely manner. 3/ Each district is required to complete ""school report cards"" which have achievement, demographic, teacher, etc info on them. Use these to get familiar with the districts you are applying to. 4/ Job searches can start as early as winter break. There are districts with full time postings up now for next year. But, there are also plenty of districts that hire into the summer or into the school year.

highschoolteachers,"I am a HS bio teacher at a charter in CA, and I see you have mentioned that is where you are now. CA is desperate for teachers, so they will not be worried in the slightest about alternative certifications. I will forewarn you that there is not as much of a market for bio teachers as for the other sciences; if you added chemistry and physics or earth science to your portfolio, your hire-ability will increase. If you want to stay in CA, your best bet to find work would be away from the coasts and look in the Central Valley (cost of living is also cheaper in the Central Valley). Your age might be a concern for people, especially if you were to teach high school. You have to have CLEAR boundaries between you and your students, even though you would all be close to the same age. You might consider teaching middle school science instead, where the age gap is greater. More so than older teachers you would REALLY need to make sure that you are professional at work at all times and not trying to be ""friends"" with students. Your students might also have a hard time drawing that distinction, especially if they find out how old you are or find you on social media. If you do decide to go into a teacher prep/credentialing program and teach at the same time, just be aware that it is going to consume a LOT of your free time. The first year of teaching is hard anyway, but having to do work for your own classes on top of teaching makes it extra stressful. I am not trying to discourage you, but give you a better picture of what to expect. It is do-able, but it is not easy. TL;DR: most schools are not concerned with alternative certification programs, you would find work in the Central Valley (if you stay in CA), school/life balance is shot especially the first couple of years, draw HARD boundaries between yourself and students if you teach HS, and consider teaching chem/physics/Earth science too.",i bio teacher charter ca see mentioned ca desperate teacher worried slightest alternative certification forewarn much market bio teacher science added chemistry physic earth science portfolio hire ability increase want stay ca best bet find work would away coast look central valley cost living also cheaper central valley age might concern people especially teach clear boundary student even though would close age might consider teaching science instead age gap greater older teacher would really need make sure professional work time trying friend student student might also hard time drawing distinction especially find old find social medium decide go teacher prep credentialing program teach time aware going consume lot free time first year teaching hard anyway work class top teaching make extra stressful trying discourage give better picture expect able easy to do school concerned alternative certification program would find work central valley stay ca life balance shot especially first couple year draw hard boundary student teach i consider teaching chem physic earth science
highschoolteachers,"Even though you would be teaching one content area like English, you could teach different grade levels so you would have planning for each of those classes. Classroom management is different and tactics and strategies are more complex since you might have 18 year olds who hate school and are disruptive but want to be treated like young adults even though they do not seem to know what that looks like. I love teaching high school though in terms of content and the kids. Young adults is more my style than unruly middle schoolers. Not saying high schoolers are not unruly buts they are not bouncing off the walls either. You have to have a passion for your content area because that will carry over in your teaching, which for apathetic learners means a lot. Id you are lucky and after a few years of teaching you might get to teach advanced classes, and that is kind of the sweet spot, so it seems. I teach gen ed and I Am okay with that.

highschoolteachers,"It generally comes down to the complexity of ideas and the quality of the diction and syntax that improves as students progress through high school. We spend 9th and 10th grade focusing on the ""rules"" of writing--i.e. mastering the standard five-paragraph essay structure, supporting claims with evidence, writing a clear thesis statement. 11th and 12th are more college preparatory in focus; once students have demonstrated mastery of the basics, they are ready to move on to college level writing, which often breaks those rules. You will have students at all grade levels who write beautifully and are able to break the rules before the rest of your students can. This cannot necessarily be taught; those kids develop style and voice over many years of avid reading and writing. All you can do is encourage it, celebrate it, and get them to push boundaries. I think giving kids ""numbers"" of things to include in a thesis or in an essay is arbitrary. I give guidelines, like sentence starters etc., especially with lower level writers but emphasize that it is not the only way to accomplish the task. The most important thing is, in argumentative writing, do they make a claim? Is it arguable? And do they back it up with clear evidence? It will become more intuitive to you the more essays you read. You will start to notice patterns in student writing. I do not know what level of kids you are teaching, but you may want to look up the writing rubrics for AP English classes.

highschoolteachers,"(ex) student here. In elementary school, I had a really kind teacher (she was (is, but at different school now) teaching math and physics), her and I somehow became friends, it happened at first sight. We saw each other and I felt a click, you know when something gets to its place. We always teased each other in her classes (I was 12, and where I live you graduate from elementary at 14-15 yrs old, we do not have middle schools, you go to elementary school for 8 years and 4-5 years at high school). So anyway it lasted for a good 3 years, we often talked about basically nothings, just some random stuffs in periods, and we lived really close to each other, so sometimes we went to school together (we went to school with the same bus and we often met there by accident). And after graduation, I went back to my elementary school almost every Friday, or when I had time for that, just to meet her. At that time we had never spoken to each other outside of school. And again we did not speak about important subjects just some random things, like about my high school, education, favorite tv shows/books, etc, you know just some small talk kind of stuffs. And at that time we often went home together (I mean, we went with the same bus). Before I graduated from high school she changed school, so after that, we did not meet each other, except for once, and that was just a random thing, she had business at the same location as I had, so again by accident, and that went for a couple of years. We started talking and meeting again for almost 3 years now. But this time we use Facebook messenger for talking and we are planning our meetings now. I was very shy and awkward (mostly awkward) like every teenager, but now we can talk about anything, it is now way more than just a teacher-student friendship, she is really a close friend of mine now. FYI I am a woman too, and I had an average childhood, I was just a little bit weirder compared to my classmates (and family members).

highschoolteachers,"My mom and I are both teachers, but she teaches elementary and I teach high school science. She currently teaches second grade at a title 1 school where she frequently encounters students with horrendous backstories. I Am talking about kids who quite literally have parents that are obvious drug addicts, in jail, or just absent for whatever reason. I do not teach at the kind of school she does, and I felt the same way you do. Hell, I might still feel that way. But, one day I asked her why she puts herself through all of that difficulty (because she deals with some nightmare behaviors I will not ever experience), and she gave me some perspective. In life, generally were more proud of the things that took us a lot of time and effort to do. The harder we work at something, the more accomplished we feel when we succeed. Working with a difficult population is kind of like that. You put in a lot of hard work and deal with a lot of problems, but there is also the possibility that you might change one of your students lives for the better, forever. Imagine being able to impact children in that kind of way. For some people, the work is worth it for the reward! She also said that with each kind of population (title 1 vs. affluent), there are different problems and different positives. For title 1s, there is typically less parental involvement (i do not want to generalize but that is been my moms experience as a teacher for over 30 years). That also means there is less pushback from families and less helicopter parents reporting you to admin. This alleviates some of the stressors of being a teacher. When teaching at more affluent schools, however, there is generally higher parental involvement. AKA- more helicopter parents questioning your teaching and reporting you to admin, which forces you to do more tedious documentation and causes additional stress that is less likely to occur if you taught at a less affluent school. So, I Am not sure what the answer is. I think it depends on you, the population of kids, the people who work at the school, and honest to god luck of the draw. You could work at a school with great kids, but your coworkers and admin are toxic. Or you could work at a school with highly difficult kids, and have an awesome support team. And it just depends!

highschoolteachers,"Australian high school perspective. We have been explicitly told we are not to have students on social media until 5 years after they graduate. The only exception to this rule I have ever done is if the student also happens to be a colleagues child. I have met for coffee with past students but it is always in a very public place and there has been another person there if possible (e.g. fellow colleague) and I had a lot to do with the family. I still see the mum because her youngest is in prep at my school. There are very strict rules with relationships with students. I feel these are potentially relaxed in small towns/ communities but the big thing is transparency. For example I have driven students home after late night school events but only with the explicit permission of both their parents and my school administrators and only as a last resort (e.g. the kid would be stranded late at night). Even then I have a dash cam in my car and use that as insurance to protect myself. What complicates a Miss Hunny type situation is that children in at risk environments like that are more likely to be at risk for grooming etc. More likely for Matilda is that Miss Hunny would have called child protection services and keeps detailed notes on all of the abuse Matilda faces but that was also at the school so who knows. There was a great Aussie TV show about a setting scandal and the teacher takes home a kids phone and I was literally screaming at the TV ""what are you doing?"". Another factor is who the teacher is. It is not fair but a young male teacher (or any male teacher I guess) will always be looked at more suspiciously than a middle aged Mum teacher.

highschoolteachers,"Note-taking is a **requirement** if you want to be truly successful in college. I took sooooooo many notes. Not only in class, but I probably took 3-4 times as many notes outside of class--if not more. My students would never take that initiative. And I do not think it is because they do not know how. I did not really ""know how"" to take notes. I learned as I went...it turns out that simple notes just seem to help me. So write down big/key ideas and follow that up with simpler ideas, etc. In my class I do give guided notes, but not many. As I said...I really only give them if I want to speed up the notes or if there is a lot of drawing or diagramming. Or graphing. The second set of notes in my Physics class is guided because are dealing with graphing of motion--so position, velocity and acceleration vs. time graphs. It is just easier/quicker to give them some note sheets that have those graphs and have spots for them to fill in next to each thing. Then when we spend the next 2 days doing activities related to motion graphing I tell them ""look at your notes!"". And when we quiz I actually give them a new set of notes on white paper (the original is on blue or yellow paper or whatever). Why? Because I tell them that they need to transcribe or re-write their notes onto the white paper and they can use that during the quiz. If they do not want to use their notes then they do not need to do that. The colored paper is so that any clever ones cannot just use a copier to transfer the notes (if they have access to one which some do at home). It will transfer the color over as well and the white paper will be darker/grayer. There is a way around that, but I do not think my students are smart enough to know BEFOREHAND so they will screw up their only copy. There is something to be said about: taking your own notes. Re-writing notes. And giving more notes. Notes **help**. They guide students to what they need to study. Yes, they are boring, but do not do straight notes for more than 15-20 minutes. If a kid cannot deal with 15-20 minutes of notes then deal with that however you need to (at least in high school). Otherwise, have an activity ready to do after the notes.

I am naturally a very anxious and obsessive person (in therapy to figure this all out) and lately I have been obsessing about my future. I cannot enjoy break with all of it on my mind. Is it true that I will have to work a second job while I teach? I think its ridiculous that I will need a second job after paying and grinding for a 4 year degree. Also, how do you scrape together money for classroom supplies? Does it come out of your pocket? Do you receive a stipend? Lastly, I love kids but some of them are straight up rude to me (yes, elementary aged ones) and I get easily offended. How do I avoid being offended by this behavior? Do you have any tips for dealing with this? I worked with some kids this summer and a second grader told me, ""I never liked you"" while a kindergartner told me ""You are annoying."" I know its stupid to be offended by children, but I take these so personally and I am so sensitive. It really affects my self esteem. Sometimes I think I am too sensitive to teach :( I was teased a lot throughout middle school and high school, and from there I developed my sensitivity.",thanks reply mind question naturally anxious obsessive person therapy figure lately obsessing future cannot enjoy break mind true work second job teach think ridiculous need second job paying grinding year degree also scrape together money classroom supply come pocket receive stipend lastly love kid straight rude yes aged one get easily offended avoid offended behavior tip dealing worked kid summer second grader told never liked kindergartner told annoying know stupid offended child take personally sensitive really affect self esteem sometimes think sensitive teach teased lot throughout developed sensitivity

I have heard of them pushing people to sign up for useless degrees and then students cannot find a job to pay back hundreds of thousands in loans. If you are wary of them, then look for online programs from a brick and mortar school. I see a lot of all online programs from GSU. https://academics.georgiasouthern.edu/online/ Do Not know the costs but make sure you are not spending a lot of money on it. See if you can get reimbursed for classes from your job. Do Not worry about the workload of online education classes. Like I said they were easier than my high school classes. It was honestly a joke.

highschoolteachers,"You Are going to want to do an online program if you work full time. It is very hard to do in person when you are tired from working all day. It is not just going to class, but finding and paying for parking, getting on a bus or walking to the building where it is located, etc. I tried to take an on campus class one time and I had to drop it within 2 weeks. It sucked because due to timing (after school when I Am tired), traffic, parking, walking, and generally being super late at night (so they can attract more teachers). From then on I only did online courses. Masters in education degrees are kind of fluff to be honest. If you wanted to get a masters in math I would be wary. But most masters in education degrees are just a checkbox to tick. My courses were easier than my high school classes. Basically online education courses follow these same pattern: they assign a reading for the week, then may require you to post about it on a discussion board, or write a paper reflecting on the reading. They may require an essay about a topic, etc. unless you do NO WORK and submit NOTHING then you get at least an A-. My recommendation is to find an ALL online program that is the cheapest. If you are looking for the pay bump it does not matter where you get this degree. Also, since you are not looking to get extra endorsements, it is even better for you. You just need that box ticked off. Lots of people do online universities (WGU, Phoenix, etc).

highschoolteachers,"You reminded me of a teacher I met during my years of subbing. She taught a Foreign Language at a Title 1 school where it was a dream to work. At the risk of sounding racist, it was a dream to work there because the school was 80-90% Asian; and, as such, it was a high-performing school where disciplinary issues were few and far between. I subbed many times there, and one time it was during an assembly day for a guest speaker. I was shocked by how quiet and respectful these high schoolers were as an audience, and by how much they engaged and went along with the dumb little activities the speaker had asked them to do. All that said, that teacher in question was bored. There may have been other problems to contend with, such as admin's BS, but at least the students were not among them. Anyway, after many years there, she left to another district. I had only one email communication with her not long after her departure, and she said that she missed the tranquility of working at her old school because now she had to deal with a lot more disciplinary issues, and now had to spend more time on classroom management than on content, although she did like that there was more variety of interactions and experiences with students.",reminded teacher met year subbing taught foreign language title dream work risk sounding racist dream work asian performing disciplinary issue far subbed many time one time assembly day guest speaker shocked quiet respectful schoolers audience much engaged went along dumb little activity speaker asked said teacher question bored may problem contend admin i least student among anyway many year left another district one email communication long departure said missed tranquility working old deal lot disciplinary issue spend time classroom management content although like variety interaction experience student

highschoolteachers,"The night before last I dreamed that I took a few high school, world geography classes on a field trip to see 2 old 17th century navy ships with a collab teacher that does not have much business teaching. I live in the middle of the country, hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean. On the trip, the students managed to use a canon to blow one of the ships up. The other ship they managed to untie and I had to swim after it(I have a bit of a phobia about the ocean and waves) then learn how to get the sails down and steer it back to the pier. Other students I caught having sex or vaping in different places. No one would listen, they were disappearing all over the place and I was constantly having to have talks and threaten calls home. Finally, near the end of the dream there were shooting noises at one of the nearby warehouses and students were refusing to be silent or wait orderly in a safe area.

highschoolteachers,"That is part of the problem. Even the company that espouses the benefits of PLC's (which again...has very *sparse* research) says ""Most schools are just doing it wrong and kidding themselves"". But that does not stop them taking $600 per head at their conferences and trainings...of course not. Whatever you were doing sounds stupid. It sounds like your admin. had no clue what the point of PLC's are. You should not have been ""forced"" to meet. You should not have had to meet every single day. You should not have been forced to get a product of any kind that you had to show to them. My admin seems to be struggling with it as well, but they are supposed to be the ""experts"" as they have gone to trainings. A few teachers from our school (at $600 a head) recently went and basically said ""It is a great idea, but there is **a lot** that needs to happen before we get there"". And part of that is changing the culture of the school--both the students and the teachers. I also think the issue is ultimately going to be consistency. We recently had an entire subject matter (at a high school) of teachers that essentially left. There was one teacher remaining out of 4. Their team devolved from being on a pedestal to being in shambles. 2 new teachers that had no clue what was going on with PLC's joined and a third teacher joined that is hard-headed and **knows** what works for his students joined. Part of the hiring at my school has become ""Can they work well in a team?"", but I question whether that is sufficient. What about transfers that we have no choice on? How do you tell from an interview whether someone will work well? How do you get new teachers to *stay* with all of this work that is necessary? PLC's are nothing new. Even when the term was new...it was not new. It was a couple of educational researchers wrapping up old ideas into a new name (which is nothing new in education). They are going to last because they tick all the boxes that parents and admin want to hear, but there is no way to be truly consistent with them in the long-term at a school. The entire dynamic of a team changes with old members leaving and new members arriving which means everything goes back to square 1. And that is just not going to sit well with veteran teachers who know what works in their classrooms--we all know them and work with them. We also know that some of them are right and some of them are wrong. That is the nature of the beast and PLC's seem to expect that given time...eventually...everyone will be able to reach that ultimate goal of ""perfection"" in the classroom. And that is just ridiculous.",part problem even company espouses benefit ply sparse research say school wrong kidding stop taking per head conference training course whatever sound stupid sound like admin clue point ply forced meet meet every single day forced get product kind show admin seems struggling well supposed expert gone training teacher head recently went basically said great idea lot need happen get part changing culture student teacher also think issue ultimately going consistency recently entire subject matter teacher essentially left one teacher remaining team devolved pedestal shamble new teacher clue going ply joined third teacher joined hard headed know work student joined part hiring become work well team question whether sufficient transfer choice tell interview whether someone work well get new teacher stay work necessary ply nothing new even term new new couple educational researcher wrapping old idea new name nothing new education going last tick box parent admin want hear way truly consistent long term entire dynamic team change old member leaving new member arriving mean everything go back square going sit well veteran teacher know work classroom know work also know right wrong nature beast ply seem expect given time eventually everyone able reach ultimate goal perfection classroom ridiculous

However, our admin is generally supportive of actions we take, and students do receive consequences for their actions. (I work in ISS one period a day, so I hear it all...)

My city is about a 2 hour drive from four major cities in Texas that all have a starting pay that is 8k+ larger than here, without increasing the cost of living by much. We lose a lot of teachers to those larger districts because of that, and because their spouses may not be able to find well-compensated jobs here.

There are a lot of factors in and out of school that would lead to that. I do not know you are kids, so I cannot say. My advice: 1. Kids will keep saying this if you have an emotional reaction. If you calmly say, no or I do not think so, they are more likely to stop. You probably want to have honest conversations about this, but you also need to stop them from flippantly saying it. 2. Work to make your classroom a non-frustrating place. Be a reason they do not hate school. Have a positive classroom. This should really be number 1. 3. As an ELA teacher, make sure everyone can access the reading at their level. I do not have data right now, but reading level is a predictor of sticking in school. So a good ELA class really helps. 4.

There are multiple coaches for each sport due to the different levels and teams (A, B, C, or Varsity and JV) and from what I know they all semi work together and help each other. I teach at a junior high for context. High school might be different to a degree, but I do know people who teach history at high schools and do not coach as well.",think stereotype real thing teach texas history teacher campus coach actually teacher every content also coach program coaching think special certification extra training coach mean obviously know learn sport coaching typically alone multiple coach sport due different level team i i varsity je know semi work together help teach junior context might different degree know people teach history school coach well

But I generally I sum it up with being respectful and being safe.

Same with bathroom policies, I follow the general only 2 out at a time, but other than that yeah you can go.

None of the vaccines are 100% effective and hardly anyone on my campus is wearing masks (I also know some who have refused to get it). I already know some people who have gotten sick with the delta variant after getting vaccinated and it still knocked them out for almost two weeks. The goal should be NOT to get sick at all (at least as much as humanly possible) since it is not just about you as an individual. You can still spread it to others, take it home, etc. I am just really having a hard time understanding people's logic in discontinuing the wearing of masks because they have been vaccinated when none of them are 100% effective.

highschoolteachers,"Teaching Physics/Astronomy in high school, this is also my experience. For a while, I made up a short contract that I would have copies of on hand for students who refused to do any work, wherein it is stated that I tried to engage and help (and had sections to check indicating which methods were attempted, including an ""other"" spot w/ room to explain), and that the student is still refusing based on their own desires and that this would forfeit their right to get extra/make-up help from me on those topics. For the most part, this worked well, and many students were happy to sign this contract day in and day out (btw, it had provisions about disturbing class so I could still follow basic/required procedures for such situations according to our school's policies). This was a thing mentioned in the syllabus that parents and students signed at the start of the year, which was an effective CYA as far as my use of it. Parents were sometimes surprised about this when they ""found out"" later in the year, but even then they generally understood and took it up with their student - I found that this method did a good job of relieving the duty to do an impossible thing (""making"" an apathetic kid do anything) while also making it clear that I did indeed do my best to help and engage (my class was damned fun, but those stories will be saved for later). The one issue that came up with this was when admin decided they did not like the clause stating that I would not go back to help remediate them over stuff they did not do. I removed it and was allowed to continue with these, but I did have to adjust how I handled students coming in (often the day before/of a test or the week before finals) begging for help with ""everything"". I would just look at their signed forms and figure out what content they were missing from those dates and very slowly work through it. It was often impossible for them to get the amount of help they needed in time, so it was still a somewhat effective encouragement to be more engaged in the future, though plenty would still just bail when they realized I was not just going to give them a busy-work assignment that would make up all the *points* they had missed.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;30min activity if its hands on and presented right. then we do a 10-20min breakall day was like that. they did that since kindergarten, so i was following that same system and it worked well. I am just saying, I have had autistic, ADHD, and behavior kids that could not handle 30 minutes of continuous work even with the ""fun"" stuff, and I am in a gen ed setting so I was surprised by your wording in the original post. For some, I literally started with the goal of 2 minutes of pro-social, on-task, appropriate behavior and then they moved to a short 1-2 minute break. I teach kinder in a gen ed setting so I understand this may seem extreme if you are dealing with older kids, but my husband is a high school SPED teacher and has definitely had kids that need to start with a 5-on, 5-off system. Not too different than some of my kinders. For kids with autsim or ADHD I am surprised they did not have frequent breaks as part of their IEPs since 30 minutes can be pushing it even for gen ed kids depending on the activity and intensity. 30 mins of work is fine for some activities, but it is school. Not everything gets to be hands on and fun lol. Sometimes there is work to be done. My lower-functioning kids could maybe handle a 30 minute block of fun and hands-on stuff, but when it came to actual work would struggle. I also do not have the time, resources, or energy to plan every single lesson to be engaging specifically for the one kid (or small handful). Sometimes we got to sit at our desks and do math. This is a normal expectation in society so it was my goal to get my kids to a point where they could do this to some extent. Not everything in life is going to be fast-paced, hands-on, engaging, and fun. My job is to build functional skills so they can sit at a desk for periods of time without distracting their peers, throwing a desk, ripping up their work, and actually learn. Are you trained, certified, etc in SPED? Like do you have a SPED degree? As a resource teacher I love your systems and I would do pretty much the same thing. I am in first grade next year and my ELA block will be a lot like what you described--centers with one-on-one or small group being a station, and a station for free choice or brain break. 100% that is the way to go. As an adult, I still need things to be highly visual. I do not remember anything, legitimately I have a horrible memory to the point that it impairs my life so I need instructions, important dates, etc to be written out somewhere. Lists are helpful if they are short and short-term. I also need to see a calendar to get an idea of how long or close something is in time. I need concrete. Watching movies with subtitles is a necessity for me so I can follow what is going on. Routines are incredibly important for me. I also need clear, simple instructions for new or complex tasks and repeating them back helps. I do this with my adhd kids to make sure they understand and will remember multi-step instructions.

highschoolteachers,"My advice: Multi-day group projects with an oral presentation. Whenever I feel really overwhelmed (high school, 6 different preps), I stagger these projects throughout my courses. Design a group project (PowerPoint, poster, etc) where they will independently research a topic and present to the class. While they are researching and preparing, you can prep, grade, etc. The added benefit of an oral presentation is that you grade it while they are presenting so you will not get further behind grading. If they work in groups, there is also less grading (grade one project instead of four). Collaborating, researching, and presenting are valuable higher-order thinking and soft skills anyway so it can be win-win. Do not resign. The first year is always tough. Eventually you will build enough reusable lessons that it will not be as bad. Breaking your contract can have consequences that impact future job prospects.

highschoolteachers,"Eh, I disagree - you are being too hard on yourself. For every student who did not like your minimalist approach, there is another who would complain about another teacher's cutesy or garish approach. Minimalism is an aesthetic like any other. Some students will complain about anything, and any time you are teaching a group of people, pleasing some will disappoint others. In my department, I have a teacher (who I deeply respect and would never want to criticize) who is basically the opposite of my teaching style: I am the AP Calc/Physics guy who believes in students shooting for the moon, getting excited about exploration, achievement, puzzles and thought, and who will openly tell them I respect their time too much to spend it on anything that does not further the study of the amazing world they are in. That clicks, strongly, with some students: I have kids who visit me from college every year and brighten my day telling me how much they remember and like my classes. But others hate it; they see it as nerdy, intimidating, lame and no fun. My coworker did not graduate high school initially and had to get her GED, and she identifies strongly with kids who struggle. With her, math is a tough pill they have to swallow, and she is all about being their friend to help them through the struggle. Her classes are marked by frequent breaks, coloring and wordsearch assignments, and walls filled with every oddity you could imagine. She is amazingly effective with the students that are hardest for me to reach, but I have often had to have words with some of the students who look up to me the most when their complaints about the 'fluff' in her classes border on downright mean. &amp;#x200B; If you beat yourself up over anything except shorting them on their education, you will drive yourself mad trying to please everyone.

highschoolteachers,"Well, hell yeah I Am decorating for me lol. If I have to be in a classroom for eight hours for five days a week, you better believe I Am going to make it feel less like a prison cell and more like an extension of my home and what matters to me. I think there is a balance you walk when decorating a classroom, though. Research shows that wall to wall busy-ness is distracting for students and harms learning more than helps it. Moreover, what you put up should be either strategic or let students in on the type of person you are. On the other hand, too bare of a room, and students generally are less likely to want to be there. Believe it or not, students do talk to other teachers, other staff, and their families about their teachers and their classroom spaces. Last year, during PTCs, I had several comments from families telling me that their students like how beachy and soothing my room is and that its one of their favorite spaces in the school. Kids notice when you put a lot of thought into things; they also notice your emotional state and that can affect their emotional state (because quite frankly, Id be sad if I could not so much as put up a single poster in my room). I find especially middle school students pay so much attention to classroom spaces. My high school students did not care as much. I highly recommend putting up student work samples (ungraded, of course). Many students love to see their work on display. If you do put up academic posters, I think you should set a goal to then incorporate that poster into your instruction. Classroom management related posters work the same way; I have my lab rules posted on a wall because we refer back to them before every lab session. The only place in the room that has my own personal stuff is right along my teachers desk area, and I Have never gotten complaints about my macrame wall hanging or Animal Crossing pictures lol. The AC stuff is actually a talking point for students with me. Everything else is decorated in neutral colors with a scattering of plants. Also, some kids definitely do like stools lol.

I use the power teaching teacher vs students strategy among others. I also used classroom jobs and group roles which helped some (a lot of naughty kids like having the right job).

highschoolteachers,"I taught 7/8 resource room for a decade. I was fortunate enough for a two year span to have enough space for a corner with low lights, my old stereo and big box ear headphones, a couch and a recliner from a garage sale. It really did make a difference with the students that had anxiety issues (which seems to be most of them these days). I had a young lady with test anxiety who could be in the general education setting and score a 30% on an exam she had worked hard to prepare for and then retake it on an old coffee table sitting on the couch blaring her music (thinking it was the Spice Girls back then) and get in the high 90s two hours later. To the point where the general education teacher accused us of cheating and came to my room for planning the next time (I was helping grade tests as far as the student knew). That Is some serious anxiety. A few boys who is anxiety was more outwardly manifested would come in and put on Green Day or Korn for 20 minutes and their write ups and office trips went down considerably. Another thing I noticed is a few students who were profoundly ADHD/ADD would make the honor roll during football, wrestling and to a lesser extent cross country and fail miserably during their down time. They needed the physical contact and exertion to keep their chemicals in balance? One of the moms got her son into martial arts after this and he excelled all the way through high school. My point is do not paint your kids with a broad brush. Welcome them, make an effort to know each one for who they are. Make sure you provide a safe, positive and loving environment for them (many of your resource students have never known anything but failure and negativity, there is a high chance that one or both of their parents had the same experience and do not support school at home) a kid cannot learn in a fight or flight state and you are tasked with the impossible duty of finding the answers for their quirks.

Tone of voice is important; you are still firm and not sing songy, but you are putting the focus on student success and not just fussing at them.

I flipped my class so I do not have to compete for whole class attention. I had a horrible class of kids who were not successful in middle school and had very few skills to operate in a high school classroom. Once I stopped demanding them to be quiet and focus on me and put them to work on student centered learning, things got way better. It removes the opportunity to act dumb for peer attention and puts the ball in their court. Lastly, I notice you teach a lot of SPED kids. Really keep the focus on scaffolding for all your kids, but especially your low babies. Behavior amps up when they feel frustrated and not capable.

highschoolteachers,"The federal government according to the department of educations website provides on average about 8 percent of a public schools budget. That 8 percent is also split up by literally everything the federal government provides from funding for meal plans to any additional funds used to support the school. Additionally, When the federal government increases funding to schools they are often making use of things they have more squarely in their domain to do so, for example the Biden whitehouse ties a lot of their programs to title I schools which already receive a larger share of federal funding. Similarly the No Child left behind act did not actually require schools to teach to the curriculum it entailed, it was more like a threat to remove funding from other parts of the states budget if they did not comply. So as with many things with questions of the federal governments power the answer solidly falls between probably and maybe. That being said there is still that 92% of funding made by the state and local governments. This might be the idealist social studies teacher in me but you can make a difference. If you really care about the salary you make reach out to the people who can change it. Go to town meetings, get to know all of your representatives, research not only how higher salaries affect not only your life but the education of students as a whole.

Show him the jobs available to a high school dropout or flunk-out. Show him why he is learning this stuff or cool applications of the classes he is in. Alternatively, and this is probably the approach I would personally take. Let him crash and burn, and get his ass handed to him. Failure and pressure (to actually do the work) can be a great motivator. If the teachers are allowing him to turn assignments in whenever then that is on them for allowing this situation to happen.

highschoolteachers,"I agree, college should be one of many options.

Not having a bachelor's degree is currently a major disadvantage in the job market.

highschoolteachers,"If you read the study, the authors actually found that, at high achievement levels, ACT scores were negatively correlated with college readiness. They state that &gt;there is little evidence that students will have more college success if they work to improve their ACT score because most of the signal from the ACT score seems to represent factors associated with the students school rather than the student. I do not think that standardized tests are inherently bad. Students should be assessed on what they have learned from school, and these assessments should be comparable. What I disagree with is the use of standardized tests to perpetuate the myth that American college admissions is a fair and equitable process. Moreover, the obsession with test scores results in unhealthy competition and credentialism, and it distorts the goals of public education. If I could remake American public higher education, I would first start from high school. If it were not for the massive devaluation of high school diplomas over the past few decades, not everyone would need or want to go to university. Students who do not want to attend university should have the option to enroll in vocational training programs that would provide them with professional certifications and guaranteed job placements. Students who want to attend university should have to take a rigorous state-administered graduation exam which is closely aligned to the high school curriculum. Passing this exam (no matter the score) should grant you a high school diploma and a guaranteed spot at a state university. Students would rank their preferences, and if schools were overenrolled, a lottery taking preferences and/or proximity into account would be run. Ideally, states would recognize each other's diplomas, and admission would be opened to out-of-state students after all in-state students had been admitted. Community colleges could serve as the providers of many vocational programs, as well as transfer programs into university for adult learners. States might elect to establish a few elite universities or programs with separate admissions policies and/or their own entrance exams. Similarly, private universities could continue to have their own admissions policies.

highschoolteachers,"Okay, here is a long-ass answer. Calculus was invented about 50 years after the invention by Descartes of the Cartesian coordinate system, and really made popular and known about 80 years after, almost exactly 300 years ago. Descartes literally invented the graph of the polynomial. It is hard for us to understand how *separate* the disciplines were. In the 1000 years prior, geometry had settled into being a proofs based system with a fairly understood sequence for teaching. This was used as training for priests, and the upper class, and represented a fundamental belief in *certainties*. When they asked, ""How many angels could dance on the head of a pin?"", this was a *real* question that they thought would allow them to use the absolute dictates of an internally coherent logical system to make statements about the physics and understanding of the universe. Descartes' *cogito* uses this kind of mapping from internal ideation to external validity to round off the stumbling fourth step of the cogito. * I think therefore I am * I am, therefore I must be in *something* * I can imagine a perfect benevolent God. * Because I can imagine perfection, therefore perfection, and therefore God, exists. * and because he is a benevolent God, he would not leave me to be a brain in a jar, and so therefore the world exists. * I think --&gt; therefore reality exists. Anyway, long story longer: The rise and development of Al-Jebra rose out of trading and Silk Road, so think Marco Polo (13th century). By the writing of Descartes, it is had about three centuries to percolate outwards, and upwards in class. However, it is still seen as very dirty, lower class. Think of how a priest might feel about the mathematics of a merchant CPA. Separate. Along comes Descartes, and says, ""well what if we try placing plane geometry - which has only two tools, the compass (fixed distance) and the straight edge. It does NOT have angles ratios, in the trigonometric sense, though certain triangle ratios have been explored in proofs. So this is the birth of **analytic geometry** and **functions**. 50 years later, *using that new tool*, Isaac Newton and Liebnitz begin to consider limit functions as instantaneous rates of change. *Out* of that - not before, trigonometry is developed to what we think of as trig in 1745. So now you have **algebra**, specifically equation solving, and a new discipline, *analytic geometry*, and now a **new** discipline, **trigonometry**. Once you had studied each of these, in depth, you could begin to understand Newton's Calculus, and by the time of the birth of trig several hundred people or more could do Calculus, with more becoming interested all the time. Now let us look at the state of education. In the world of the 17th century, much if not most education was within the framework of the seminary and the idea of the modern college was emerging. Harvard - 1636. Yale - 1701 Cambridge and Oxford and the University of Paris had lineages as old as the mid 12th century, but perhaps it is best to view those in the context of being THE school, not in a world of readily available schools. By the foundation of the United States, Calculus and Trigonometry exist in the world and some people at the University - some - study it. Literally at the same time as the birth of Trigonometry and the spread of calculus is the **industrial revolution**. They are the same thing. They are part and parcel of one another. Things that mark the industrial revolution were only possible through the birth of these new mathematics, such as standardization of bolts and screws, the ability to manufacture matching parts, etc. Eli Whitney built his factory for interchangeable gun parts in 1798. So the upper class, and some middle and lower class adults who develop some skills and get into colleges (the seminary was a way for the poor to become educated), are studying Calculus not at the post-grad level, but now at the graduate level, and now the undergraduate level. Calculus *requires* you to be deeply facile in the other three disciplines, algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. As younger and younger students are needing that, the study of these things gets pushed into teen schooling, first at boarding schools for the middle and upper class, and then of course we have the invention of the modern public school by Horace Mann in the mid 19th century, and by the late 19th century, public schools **begin** to outnumber private schools. Dewey, at the turn of the 20th century, began convincing Americans that education should be free, universal, and focused on character and civic virtue, not simply trade school or erudition. In the 20th century, mathematics at the high school level was frequently, if not almost universally, taught as Algebra, Trig and Geometry, and calculus for those who could achieve it. As soon as calculus entered the public high school system, it re-oriented the purpose of the other classes, just as the invention of calculus had conjoined algebra and geometry two hundred years early. This can be viewed as the driver for mathematical reform in the 70s and 80s (""New Math"") and our current trend towards integrated mathematics and communication in mathematics. Obviously, I have skipped a million things, but here is the **tl:dr - of course you will never USE calculus in the middle school or even high school level, but if teachers did not have to take calculus, they would have zero idea of what the pieces of the puzzle fit together to make.**",okay long as answer calculus invented year invention descartes cartesian coordinate system really made popular known year almost exactly year ago descartes literally invented graph polynomial hard u understand separate discipline year prior geometry settled proof based system fairly understood sequence teaching used training priest upper class represented fundamental belief certainty asked many angel could dance head pin real question thought would allow use absolute dictate internally coherent logical system make statement physic understanding universe descartes cogito us kind mapping internal ideation external validity round stumbling fourth step cogito think therefore therefore must something imagine perfect benevolent god imagine perfection therefore perfection therefore god exists benevolent god would leave brain jar therefore world exists think it therefore reality exists anyway long story longer rise development al zebra rose trading silk road think marco polo the century writing descartes three century percolate outwards upwards class however still seen dirty lower class think priest might feel mathematics merchant cpa separate along come descartes say well try placing plane geometry two tool compass fixed distance straight edge angle ratio trigonometric sense though certain triangle ratio explored proof birth analytic geometry function year later using new tool isaac newton liebnitz begin consider limit function instantaneous rate change trigonometry developed think trig algebra specifically equation solving new discipline analytic geometry new discipline trigonometry studied depth could begin understand newton calculus time birth trig several hundred people could calculus becoming interested time let u look state education world the century much education within framework seminary idea modern college emerging harvard yale cambridge oxford university paris lineage old mid the century perhaps best view context world readily available school foundation united state calculus trigonometry exist world people university study literally time birth trigonometry spread calculus industrial revolution thing part parcel one another thing mark industrial revolution possible birth new mathematics standardization bolt screw ability manufacture matching part etc eli whitney built factory interchangeable gun part upper class lower class adult develop skill get college seminary way poor become educated studying calculus post grad level graduate level undergraduate level calculus requires deeply facile three discipline algebra analytic geometry trigonometry younger younger student needing study thing get pushed teen schooling first boarding school upper class course invention modern public horace mann mid the century late the century public school begin outnumber private school dewey turn the century began convincing american education free universal focused character civic virtue simply trade erudition the century mathematics level frequently almost universally taught algebra trig geometry calculus could achieve soon calculus entered public system oriented purpose class invention calculus conjoined algebra geometry two hundred year early viewed driver mathematical reform new math current trend towards integrated mathematics communication mathematics obviously skipped million thing to do course never use calculus even level teacher take calculus would zero idea piece puzzle fit together make

highschoolteachers,"I can think of some ways in which knowledge of high school level calculus (so-called horizon content knowledge) can help inform instruction in earlier courses. For example, I see a unit on piecewise functions in Algebra 1 as an opportunity to get students thinking (informally) about limits and continuity, and this exploration can be a great way to have them put into practice their understanding of piecewise functions. And I think there are lots of other examples of where knowledge of calculus and real analysis can deepen instruction, not just in algebra but in geometry as well.

highschoolteachers,It will start with a few schools making their own tests. Then a few more. Until so many schools are administering their own unique tests that the burden on students becomes too great suppressing application rates for each school. So a handful of universities will team up to give a Common Admissions Test to make it more convenient and attractive to high school graduates. Then the group will expand as more schools want access to a broader applicant pool the test attracts. Until finally the non-participating schools feel enough pressure to standardize their own admission tests to align more closely to the common test. Finally every school will decide on a single standardized admissions test for all college applicants. They will call it the SAT for convenience.,start school making test many school administering unique test burden student becomes great suppressing application rate handful university team give common admission test make convenient attractive graduate group expand school want access broader applicant pool test attracts finally non participating school feel enough pressure standardize admission test align closely common test finally every decide single standardized admission test college applicant call sat convenience
highschoolteachers,"I totally feel you on this! I have the same exact thoughts. I am a high school band director and we are unsure on even how to carry out a program and still be successful next year. Sure, there are ways but it is going to be a pain in the ass. I just finished my 5th year as a teacher. For a lot districts in my area we had to make this grading period higher than last for students even if they were passing this current period. So a kid who maybe got a 90 last grading period and did not do jack during the pandemic (even thought the student and parents had all the materials provided to them) has to receive a 91 for this current grading period. And then the students who worked and received true grades may score below the kids who did not do shit. With us having to change grades like that, what was the point of distance learning?!? Every year I at least know three people who quit teaching and I am sort of leaning towards that choice as well. I notice with almost every school these days admin does not care for students and teachers. It is a business now. Scores and money is what matters and being better than every one else by creating misleading expectations and throwing kids into ""college courses"" that do not do anything for a student in the end.",totally feel exact thought band director unsure even carry program still successful next year sure way going pain as finished the year teacher lot district area make grading period higher last student even passing current period kid maybe got last grading period jack pandemic even thought student parent material provided receive current grading period student worked received true grade may score kid shit u change grade like point distance learning every year least know three people quit teaching sort leaning towards choice well notice almost every day admin care student teacher business score money matter better every one else creating misleading expectation throwing kid college course anything student end

Again, do not panic, in states where school starts in September, HALF of all positions are filled in August. 5. Contact your professors if they are local and see if they can help you getting a job. They may have connections because odds are their students are currently administrators in public schools. You can also check out your colleges career center for help. 6. Send out at least a 100 applications. 7. If you have already paid for next semester call them and tell them you want to pause because you lost your job.

(I often get the feeling that none of my students have the same schedule.) There will have to be class changes. I just do not know how to do it and enforce distancing!

Most public schooling does a good job of giving students a very broad knowledge base, but not often a very deep one. Take, for example, your average high school math teacher teaching Algebra or Geometry. To be able to teach high school math, that teacher likely has a college degree in some field of math, and passed a comprehensive secondary math praxis exam. They could likely explain to you exactly where the quadratic formula came from, what the different parts are for, and how it is useful. But most kids are not interested in that. They just want to know how to get the answer.

highschoolteachers,"Thank you for being there for that student. I remember telling my math teacher my senior year that I had run away from home. He gave me his phone number without hesitation. He took a huge risk, seeing as he was a male teacher and I was a female student (granted, I ended up being gay anyway, so nothing was ever going to happen), but he did not even think about it. I did not end up needing to ever call him, thankfully, but it meant a lot. He trusted me and cared that much about me, when it felt like many adults really did not. It is still in my phone today. I also remember texting a health teacher once over a school break week because I was having a panic attack and did not have anyone else I could call. I did not even particularly like this teacher, but for some reason she had set up a class group text, so she was the only number I had (this must have been before the math teacher gave me his number). I felt bad, I think she was actually on the beach at the time, but she still took the time to calm me down. Anyway, what I am trying to say through all of this is that sometimes teachers are the only positive adults in a kid's life.

highschoolteachers,"Reminds me of my high school senior year English teacher. Hes such a great man!!! Hes beat cancer since I graduated high school (4 yrs ago), turns out he had cancer while I was in school with him(we just did not know) and during that summer of us graduating he was going to get treatment. I had talked to him about my situation at home throughout the year. I had towards the end come out of the closet along with other such things and my dad reacted a little rude. It was a scary time and such. In fact I think a lot of stuff during that time was because he was not so nice to me and I had so many issues with my health too (seizures) but they were also getting sooo much better! And I would sort of rant to my teacher....... so one day I think like during lunch or after school since I would talk to him. He gave me his phone number and he told me if I ever needed someone to pick me up or help me from a really bad situation (my dad had threatened to have my mom choose either I leave or he does... its sad to think my mom could maybe choose him tbh, but also other threats) he would be there. He would help me out so I would not be alone and did not have to go through anything alone. And I could call him at any time and he would be there. I never had to use it though. I only had a tablet back then (this is about 4 yrs ago) and I remember I saved it but I did not ever use it because I graduated and I left home. I was seizure free 7 months. I got my drivers license no thanks to my dad and got into a community college away from home even as my dad threatened and told me he would not let me leave and that I would not be able to do it. He was kind of inconsistent because he would say I could not do and he would not help, and then would help a little but also just stop and say no. Like he bought me a beater car but then it turned to something else. Hes totally different on that now though because I proved him wrong on that since I got my AS last year (took me a while, life does not stop happening just because you are in school lol) and now I Am getting my BA! I Have held a job just like any other person going to school full-time and having something part time. Plus just recently I got a full-time job and am living in another state while Ill be going to school to finish my degree! I Have never given up before and now is not the time. I Have worked in schools during college (part-time but lesson plans and such things that I would do at home made it feel like full-time with no pay haha) from being ASP tutor with my own class of students from 1st-3rd grades. I Have been a substitute tutor for other grades as well as working for summer programs all day teaching stem classes (science/engineering) for the kids! We made workbooks of the projects! I would have about 20-30 students (30 was over summer and I had a co-tutor/teacher and a para-pro who was awesome!!). I could not have more than 20 students just myself because I Am not credentialed like you guys, I just had to take a few exams and training (monthly but also online ones) to be able to hold the job, as well as be in college. But mannnn I did elementary and those kids can be kind of rough lol but they are really lovable and kind. I miss my kiddos. I moved up to more admin positions where I would run the program and talk to parents more since Id ID them and their contacts to pick up kids. I memorized over 190 students in program along with their parents. I also put them in classes, updated contact and sign outs, etc. I was all over the school most days. Rough. But now I have a different job doing something else and its full time lol. The school was just part time but in those few hours I worked and would do lesson plans, file, contact, admin, etc. It felt like I was there all day and to top it off I had school lol with some relatively low pay for what I did. I Have had incredible teachers to help me get at where I Am at today though. Principals, nurses, office staff, random family friends I would meet, classmates. I have too many to count and there is no way in hell I could repay them. They really helped this socially awkward kid who was having seizures almost everyday if not weeks through the hardest transition he had from being a teen into adulthood. Especially had a teacher who despite going through an extremely hard health battle or knowing he was up for something that could bring death, was still there to be the person to help when it could of been needed. I have some of the teachers and principal on Facebook and its always so great to see them do great. But seeing him on my feed and knowing he exist gave me hope of the marvelous teachers out there who are truly there to make that change. And I like to think I Have started something like that too in my run working at schools. I do not know yet if I want to be a teacher, I guess Ill just see where my journey to leadership takes me.

Depending on how close the schools in your district are, you could volunteer to help out in both types of classrooms during a study hall you have. You can also volunteer with after-school programs with both age groups, or get a job at a summer camp for one and then the other age group. Just keep in mind though, you might change your opinion as you become an adult yourself (like for instance you might feel too close in age to middle-schoolers now, but that would not be an issue when you are 22 graduating college). Your own growth into adulthood may affect your perspective in general, too. If it is possible to get dual certified in both those age groups in your state, that might be a smart idea - then you could have the option of applying for either grade level.",taught love challenge well way really tell get experience get experience still asking guidance counselor help set job shadow teacher teach depending close school district could volunteer help type classroom study hall also volunteer program age group get job summer camp one age group keep mind though might change opinion become adult like instance might feel close age schoolers would issue graduating college growth adulthood may affect perspective general possible get dual certified age group state might smart idea could option applying either grade level
highschoolteachers,"Here Is my huge problem with gradesthey have no intrinsic value. Receiving a good grade does not improve your human life in any real way. Just like how being overly motivated by money causes people to lead stressful, overworked, empty lives, being overly motivated by grades leads students to lead empty academic lives. Let Us assume that its possible to design assessments that guarantee that only students who learn the material are given good grades. A student who has motivations for learning besides earning good grades would have learned the material regardless. A student who is motivated by grades will indeed learn the material to succeed in the class, but what happens afterwards? Their learning was instrumental to getting a good grade. Now that they have achieved this, unless they continue being graded on this learning and they continue to be grade-motivated, they will have no desire to retain anything they have learned or to continue learning on their own. And ultimately, there comes a point in everyone is life where grades are no longer given or grades do not matter to them anymore. My goal as a teacher is not just to get the students to ingest the content and to vomit it all out on their final exam. As a math teacher, I want my students to come to enjoy math, to engage in mathematical practices, and to continue doing this long after they leave my classroom. In my experience, the most grade-motivated students are the ones who are the most resistant to this. That Is why I spend a lot of time trying to help them break free from grades. Unfortunately, by the time many of them get to me in high school, their attitudes towards grades are too deeply ingrained to be significantly changed in one year. My even bigger problem with grades is that they are misused outside of the classroom to make decisions about students futures. As an example, in one of my high school dual-enrollment (college credit) classes, I had a classmate who was not prepared enough to take the class. However, this class was required by our high school program. He tried his hardest, but he ended up with a C. He was not only forced to leave the programhe was denied admission to our state university because of his low college credit GPA, even though his high-school credit GPA was higher than average. If he had not been required to take the class, he would have been admitted. This is just one example of how grades can hurt students. Not only will low grades hurt their college admissions chances, low grades can disqualify students from scholarships and financial aid. Issues over grades can stress students' relationships with their families and their peers. And they often improperly influence students' feelings of self-worth and self-efficacy. Why because so much harm to students over something that has no intrinsic value? That Is why I try not to inflict upon my students the misfortune of having a hard-ass for a teacher. If I was not required to give grades, I would stop immediately. They are awful. They go against everything I believe about the purpose of education. There are so many better ways to motivate students and to provide them with useful feedback about their learning. I hope that one day, we can dismantle this inhumane system and the greedy corporations that exploit it (looking at you, College Board).",huge problem gradesthey intrinsic value receiving good grade improve human life real way like overly motivated money cause people lead stressful overworked empty life overly motivated grade lead student lead empty academic life let u assume possible design assessment guarantee student learn material given good grade student motivation learning besides earning good grade would learned material regardless student motivated grade indeed learn material succeed class happens afterwards learning instrumental getting good grade achieved unless continue graded learning continue grade motivated desire retain anything learned continue learning ultimately come point everyone life grade longer given grade matter anymore goal teacher get student ingest content vomit final exam math teacher want student come enjoy math engage mathematical practice continue long leave classroom experience grade motivated student one resistant spend lot time trying help break free grade unfortunately time many get attitude towards grade deeply ingrained significantly changed one year even bigger problem grade misused outside classroom make decision student future example one dual enrollment college credit class classmate prepared enough take class however class required program tried hardest ended i forced leave programme denied admission state university low college credit gpa even though credit gpa higher average required take class would admitted one example grade hurt student low grade hurt college admission chance low grade disqualify student scholarship financial aid issue grade stress student relationship family peer often improperly influence student feeling self worth self efficacy much harm student something intrinsic value try inflict upon student misfortune hard as teacher required give grade would stop immediately awful go everything believe purpose education many better way motivate student provide useful feedback learning hope one day dismantle inhumane system greedy corporation exploit looking college board

highschoolteachers,"Let me just present a controversial and unpopular opinion about grading and public education in general. I am ok with any potential downvotes just please share your thoughts and discuss. I will also admit that I come from a high school background so that may color my opinions. High school is a cultural coming of age ritual rather than a place for learning. Grades, as they are now used, are a means for student compliance. They are not really used to judge how well material has been learned. My argument for this is simple. If, on the first day of class, you told all your students that they were all going to get an A no matter what, what percent of students would do anything for your class? I can honestly say that the majority of my students really do not care about what I teach. The best that I have been able to do is capture their attention with a little edutainment. When the gimmicks are all gone and its time to do serious work I lose them again. At most three to five percent of my students really care about learning the material. The rest just care about their grades. My ""best"" students want to get A's and many other just want to pass. It does not matter how engaging, interesting or relevant I try to make my material. At the end of the day, students go through a social ritual and once they graduate they are now ""adults."" This is just a sophisticated and time consuming social ritual that is very similar to those that primitive societies use to establish man or womanhood. I am not making a value judgment here. This can be good or bad. And this is also not to say that learning does not happen at the high school level. Rather, those who DO want to learn usually have the opportunity to do so. There are AP and Honors classes. But I would argue that these classes make up a tiny minority of the students in the schools. Schools with highly motivated upper middle class students are all just jumping through elaborate hoops so that they get good careers. Again, they are less interested in a quality education than they are in grades and GPA so they can be accepted into prestigious universities. Which brings me to the topic of grades themselves. I do not like them. I feel like my job as a teacher is to teach and educate. However, grading is a bureaucratic sorting mechanism. I am aiding in the administrative ranking of students. Is grading even good for students? Even higher education struggles with grade inflation. Truth be told, grading is a scam. I will not lie, I am an agent of the school system, so, working in the system and trying to preserve my job, I make use of grading to get student compliance. But I do not pretend like those grades are real. And I do not think having students attend summer school or retaking my class the next year is beneficial for them. Perhaps if the system had some consistency then, yes, failing students makes sense so that they will learn their lesson. But everywhere I have worked, my most problematic students have reacted in the same way to threats of failure. They tell me they have done the same thing in all their classes and passed anyway. Sorry about the long response, but really, I make sure I do not fail anyone unless that person is a no show, has literally done ZERO work all year and is also failing other classes.

They were legitimately concerned about how to graduate before they aged out. We had 18 year olds sign themselves out of beginning level EL classes and put themselves in American Literature and then fail. We tried to talk them out of it, but there was a small portion of students who would do it every year. The worst was when we had students under 18 get their parents on board for this plan.

highschoolteachers,"Both have their challenges and rewards. I know people who love teaching junior high and do a fantastic job working with teenagers. Not me- I taught 5th grade last year and that is about the highest age I would want to go. Some things I like about teaching elementary: most of the kids are sweet, you get to do a lot of ""fun"" things (field day, show and tell, field trips), content is generally easier. You get to teach a lot of basic skills, and it is usually easy to connect to the real world. Some downsides: depending on what grade you teach, the kids need a lot of help and cannot be very independent. If you work with little kids, you will be tying a lot of shoes; even older kids will need help with directions and staying focused. Also, you may have the same group of kids all day. I teach only ELAR now and had two classes, which felt like an eternity some days. When I taught 3rd grade, I was self-contained and oh boy.

highschoolteachers,"I did not read all the comments so I Am not sure if this has been said, but I Am in TX with a huge ELL population right next to the border. 90% of the time when a parent waives services, its because they do not understand what the services are or how it helps both the student and the parents. Its so critical parent meetings and other positive relationship building events are scheduled to help improve the relationship between the school and the family, and providing resources and all communication in their home language. A lot of parents I do not hear back from via email are because they do not understand my email in English. It is frustrating trying to contact parents in my broken attempt at Spanish, or relying on others to facilitate communication, but I cannot fault the family, or the kid, for not understanding what ELL education provides and supports. Of course this does not apply to all kids or families - some just flat out say no without any clear reasoning - but, it is important to maintain empathy for second language learners, especially when they enter at the high school level not knowing much English. Its crazy to me how few districts mandate ELL training and certification for teachers. I taught in SC and had multiple students who could only say hello and I was given zero legit training except a booklet with suggested strategies. In TX, I had to pass an exam and take a 2 day course to help me study for the exam.

She was going to shoot a kid that her precious was in a fight with. I had a kid one year who would not sit down. Ever. He wandered around class antagonizing everyone, singing, dancing, swearing, yelling, cussing me out. Nobody in that 29 student class could get any work done and I could not teach. I was a newish teacher, but I knew the kid was a problem when the 30-year veteran teacher whom everyone in the school respected said he did not know what to do with this kid. Ruined one whole class period every day for a solid year. That is a small selection of individual stories involving kids. There are problem kids. But they could be dealt with if admin would remove them or allow you to give them consequences. That does not happen though, in many schools. In many schools, students are allowed to turn in work whenever they want, in whatever order, sometimes even 2 or 3 quarters late, after grades have been in for months. Sucks to be you; you have to grade it all, whenever they choose to turn it in. They love to turn in piles of crap right before the end of the quarter, leaving you to spend your whole weekend/vacation sorting through a bunch of illegible nonsense to grade. They and their parents love to come up with reasons why it is your fault they did not get their work done on time, or at all, and they love to take those made-up reasons to admin. who, inexplicably tend to believe them. You may get called out or ""encouraged"" to ""find a way"" for failing students to pass, wink, wink; which involves either compromising your integrity or wasting more of your time coming up with ""extra credit"" for students who did not do any of the original work you assigned. It is all about grades and pass/graduation rates, at the expense of actual learning. This becomes frustrating and demoralizing very quickly. Then there is the daily nonsense that involves redundant bullshit paperwork, data, documentation, filling out endless IEP and 504 plans, calls and emails to parents, meetings, trainings and covering other classes that eats up all your plan time.

I like my colleagues for the most part, and we socialize (well, at least we did before the pandemic) at times, but for the most part I try to separate work life from home life. And even if you get less satisfaction because of a lack of meaningful interaction with your fellow teachers, there is still plenty of satisfaction derived from relationships with students and helping them to grow and maximize their education.

One of my students today remarked that I told the class I loved them - I show my love in different ways, but I usually do not say I love you all. But I did today. How spring break ended last year is why I told todays students I love them and Ill miss them - because I did not cherish that moment a year ago, not thinking I would need to.

I am posting on here, teacher facebook groups, school groups, and pretty much anywhere I can that has some traffic of teachers and professors. I also made a quick 10minute video explaining the entire project and these steps I am listing here. The purpose of this step is to gain more momentum and support on the idea so that schools can see this is something that will benefit schools and communities. Step 3 is broadening the high school hands-on CPR requirement to colleges and universities along with the same proposed incentive.

I worked all through high school to supplement my parent's shitty wages and they still managed to get on my ass about school- because with it I could go to college or something and do BETTER than them. And I did. I had a lot of help along the way from teachers poking their nose in where (at the time) it was really almost intrusive. But I reciprocated that interest with trying and effort. And when I did not I got a boot up the ass from my parents. This was in the 1990s- computers were barely a thing, so research and writing were all done the hard way. I turned in a few papers from a typewriter at home because I could not stay after school in the lab to type. I am also a parent now, and working full time, and trying to herd 4 kids through school at various levels, along with having finished my Masters's degree last month.

So now I teach 350 students by myself by meeting with them every other day instead of every day. It has been the worst year of my career, and if it were not for the fact that one of the high school teachers is resining, giving me the chance to move up there, I would be looking for other employment this summer.

I was just commenting that I believe at least the system in California promotes the university path too much. Part of this is to increase the number of graduates of this kind in our region, most of whom have the better work opportunities in coastal cities and do not remain.

I started working in 98 and our youth counselor came in 3 times a week, now we get a social worker 1/2 day every two weeks and a counselor on an opposite bi-weekly schedule. I have been able to predict what was going to happen to many of these kids going to high school, without intervention, and lo and behold it goes to crap for them.

highschoolteachers,"I had one coworker ask at a virtual faculty meeting why masks are necessary. She claims that her husband told her that he watched One America News and that the CDC had allegedly claimed that wearing masks makes no difference to anyone's health. (I checked the CDC website and found that they have not said anything of the kind.) Given how politicized anything about Covid has become, I did not say anything. I did send the principal a link to the CDC guidelines which continue to stress the importance of social distancing and wearing masks. In the end the principal chose to reiterate district policy which includes a mask mandate. Some of my colleagues have told me that they will not get vaccinated. I do not understand why and again, to avoid getting political, I have declined to comment on their choices. One of our recently elected school board has been sending out tweets. She wants us to reopen our schools as soon as possible for full in person instruction. She has also said that anyone who will not get behind this can find another job. It is fortunate that the other board members and the superintendent do not agree with her. It is also lucky that we have a union. The union got the district to delay reopening high school until two weeks after all teachers who wanted to be vaccinated were vaccinated (to give our bodies sufficient time to build up antibodies).",one coworker ask virtual faculty meeting mask necessary claim husband told watched one america news cac allegedly claimed wearing mask make difference anyone health checked cac website found said anything kind given politicized anything couid become say anything send principal link cac guideline continue stress importance social distancing wearing mask end principal chose reiterate district policy includes mask mandate colleague told get vaccinated understand avoid getting political declined comment choice one recently elected board sending tweet want u reopen school soon possible full person instruction also said anyone get behind find another job fortunate board member superintendent agree also lucky union union got district delay reopening two week teacher wanted vaccinated vaccinated give body sufficient time build antibody

Yeah, in all fairness, did anyone here care about how to file taxes or figure out a mortgage amortization schedule when they were 15? It is just impossible to relate to. Adults care about it because it affects their everyday lives. Think about the most boring subject someone talks about, and you just walk away because you do not care...that is taxes to a high-schooler. I am not sure how you make it relevant. Lots of kids are super into the social media and influencer lifestyle (i.e. ""I want to be a YouTuber..."") so it might be interesting to walk them through *how* to run your YouTube channel like a business, including where revenue comes from (ads, Patreon, merch, etc), where costs come from (equipment, merch, employees, paid ad campaigns, etc) and help them learn how to budget that. And then out of that, you can be like, ""Oh yeah, do not forget taxes are part of that, and here is how that works."" Really, the core of learning is engagement, and unless you can find a way to engage someone, they are probably not going to really absorb what you are saying. Now, all that said...that is a TON of work obviously, so if teaching high-schoolers about budgeting is not your full-time focus, that might be a pretty tall-order to try to hook them.",it personal finance class felt like something ready figure yeah fairness anyone care file tax figure mortgage amortization schedule impossible relate adult care affect everyday life think boring subject someone talk walk away care tax schooler sure make relevant lot kid super social medium influencer lifestyle e want youtube might interesting walk run youtube channel like business including revenue come ad patron merch etc cost come equipment merch employee paid ad campaign etc help learn budget like oh yeah forget tax part work really core learning engagement unless find way engage someone probably going really absorb saying said ton work obviously teaching schoolers budgeting full time focus might pretty tall order try hook

highschoolteachers,"I have to be honest I felt my heart beat for a second when I saw this... when I was in high school I had a ancient civilization teacher. She was probably in her 50s and going grey, she had hand tattoos that were simple and really nice, she was a butch lesbian woman and I was in a long term relationship with another girl and was starting considering a career in education. I loved the class, I loved the teacher and I was really feeling pretty good in that class despite my overall low grades. My mental health however in general was poor. I do not really blame the teacher for her response to how I acted in the class, I look back at how I acted in school in general and cringe. I was undiagnosed with ADHD and had very low self esteem. There was one particular day that must have been hard for her and we had a quiz. We all took the short quiz and turned it in, maybe there were people still taking the quiz, but I know the quiet time had been going on for a while and a conversation started at my table, about a bullshit jail at the Sadie hawkens dance that you could only get out of if you proved you brought a date, proved by kiss. I do not remember a whole lot of the details of how it started, but it ended with her yelling at me in particular. She singled me out of my table because of my previous behavior in a loud display in front of my class that ended with her exclaiming that class is better when you are not here! I was humiliated and heartbroken. I feel so terrible that she said that to me, i skipped her class for at least three days. I was transferred out of her class after word spread around my grade and the principal got wind of it. She sat in on the class a week later and was transferred to another school soon after. But having someone I looked up to say that to me hurt my heart so bad it definitely effected the rest of my discomfort in high school until I transferred to a post secondary education option where I went to a community college for high school credits. I never intended to disrespect her. I do not know your situation, but sometimes those kids are just trying to get attention because they do not feel seen in other places, my mom worked full time and my dad suffered severe depression, my undiagnosed ADHD gave me low impulse control and some bad judgement.

If your boss is not happy with your performance, or if they think you crossed a line, then that is that, and it is not personal. hes not being arrested or losing his certification, hes just not working in that particular school anymore. The school has already made their decision, I am afraid students have really no say in getting a teacher hired (especially REhired). If the teacher wants to plead his case to keep his job, then that is between him and the administrative staff to go over in private. But trying to make a big riot over it is only going to make a spectacle, and honestly, could make him seem like even more of a headache if the school district thinks he may have encouraged such protest. If you want to do something nice for the teacher, maybe talk to a counselor at the school to see if they can help pass along a handwritten note where you can tell him how much you appreciate what he did for you academically. Do Not try to friend him or contact him online, as that would be inappropriate, but maybe a note passed along by the staff would be possible. Again, I am sorry that you are losing a favorite teacher.

highschoolteachers,"I would recommend against it because you are probably romanticizing what the job actually is. And that is not your fault, since no one - from high school teaching cadets to the college of education at any school in the US - is accurately portraying what being a teacher these days is like. It is a lot of paperwork, teaching to a meaningless test, dealing with apathy from students and parents, being put under scrutiny, etc. A great deal of our time is spent doing things that are not teaching, grading, or planning... which in my opinion is a mistake that is burning new teachers out quickly. But again, that is why I do not recommend it. Your mileage may vary, and there are many teachers who are very happy with their careers. I personally can tolerate these things, but getting to that point was not easy at all. So if you have just a mild passing interest in teaching, I would recommend against it. If you are very interested in teaching, I would recommend having a backup plan... because there is a 50% chance that you will leave.",would recommend probably romanticizing job actually fault since one teaching cadet college education u accurately portraying teacher day like lot paperwork teaching meaningless test dealing apathy student parent put scrutiny etc great deal time spent thing teaching grading planning opinion mistake burning new teacher quickly recommend mileage may vary many teacher happy career personally tolerate thing getting point easy mild passing interest teaching would recommend interested teaching would recommend backup plan chance leave

highschoolteachers,"I agree that the fundamental culture has to change. Where I work now, we have been influenced too much by Western post-modern thought where a teacher using perfectly standard disciplinary techniques is ""forcing their reality"" on students. It is insidious. So yes in some respects we cannot blame the kids (I am talking about older students in a remedial/ELL class) but in other respects I have to draw the line somewhere. In my high school we had a system of student-teacher leadership. The highest 12% of students in the grade were designated as ""prefects"" who were allowed to give demerits (giving so much as an unjustified demerit was enough to have you stripped of your title). Too many demerits and you would have a detention which usually involved helping the office secretaries do some mundane task like making and stapling copies or putting stickers on envelopes to mail out. Further infractions involved harder and harder tasks like shining shoes, having to get up early and do breakfast check-in, or even helping a janitor during recess. Each class had a class leader (usually the kid who got the highest grade in the previous week) who was responsible for assisting the teacher with discipline/classroom procedure. Teachers were also strict (in my opinion much more strict than now) but fair. Now the strange thing is that as strict as the system was, for the most part we did not need it. There was not any blatant disrespect of any major rule breaking. If you did wrong, you were disciplined and you were expected to learn and move on. I remember getting a detention once because my hair did not comply with uniform policy. I said that I did not get a haircut because I did not have the money. For my detention, Principal took me into his office, puts $12 in an envelope and gives it to the secretary, and says that if I help out the office ladies for an hour, I get the money. He gave me a speech about being more responsible with spending, and to remember to remember to set aside $12 for a haircut next time. And that is something I have remembered. To this day I still set aside a bit of money for a haircut every month. So we learned to manage our own behavior. For the most part, we policed themselves, without becoming rats, and held ourselves accountable. These days this kind of system is almost unthinkable. I really disagree with the notion that there have to be second, third, and fourth chances and even then you have to take the ""higher road"" and ""be compassionate"".",agree fundamental culture change work influenced much western post modern thought teacher using perfectly standard disciplinary technique forcing reality student insidious yes respect cannot blame kid talking older student remedial ell class respect draw line somewhere system student teacher leadership highest student grade designated prefect allowed give demerit giving much unjustified demerit enough stripped title many demerit would detention usually involved helping office secretary mundane task like making stapling copy putting sticker envelope mail infraction involved harder harder task like shining shoe get early breakfast check even helping janitor recess class class leader usually kid got highest grade previous week responsible assisting teacher discipline classroom procedure teacher also strict opinion much strict fair strange thing strict system part need blatant disrespect major rule breaking wrong disciplined expected learn move remember getting detention hair comply uniform policy said get haircut money detention principal took office put envelope give secretary say help office lady hour get money gave speech responsible spending remember remember set aside haircut next time something remembered day still set aside bit money haircut every month learned manage behavior part policed without becoming rat held accountable day kind system almost unthinkable really disagree notion second third fourth chance even take higher road compassionate
highschoolteachers,"College faculty here at a small school, but I previously taught at a large school. I will try and answer the bullets individually. 1) Yes I do, but I have not taught freshmen in a few years. Generally the issues are not academic, I feel like most high schoolers who make it into a college can ""hack it"" academically. The biggest transitional issue I see is time management. High schoolers mostly have their day-to-day rigidly structured by a all-day class schedule, after school activities, and parents. College day-to-day life requires you create your own structure and follow through with it. 2) Yes and no. Community college can be a transition period in which the above time management issue gets worked on in a lower-stakes environment. But I get the sense CC is way less academically rigorous. In fact, some of the least academically prepared students I have had graduated from a CC that had a ""pipeline agreement"" with the 4-year university I was teaching. Such an agreement entails a 4-year university automatically accepting graduates from a certain local CC. I have seen many students coast through a CC degree, then automatically get into a 4-year they are totally unprepared for. 3) I would say a firm majority are undecided their freshman year, even I they formally have a major on paper. That is generally not ideal. The students who show up decided do best and get out earliest. But I feel like in the first two years, most student firmly know what they want to do. 4) I would end the pipeline programs like I described. They send a ton of students into academic experience they are not prepared for. That or make CCs involved in such agreements more rigorous. I would also invest in more career and vocational education. A lot of students actively resent the process of getting a liberal arts degree, but do it because there parents told them its the only path to the middle class, which is not necessarily true. 5) Males. It may be counter-intuitive given the gender pay gap, but males lag well behind females in college admission, performance and retention.

I also have a decent amount of work experience all considering: I was a research assistant in college, an assistant manager of a retail store, a substitute for a year, I also volunteered to teach ESL classes at night and volunteered to be a teaching assistant for about a year in high school as one of my electives, and of course this year I am finally teaching as a certified professional. This is my first year officially teaching in my own classroom and I always thought I would love being a teacher but I am way too overwhelmed and stressed out every day... the support from my school is very little and I admit that the school district I am in is particularly difficult (85% poverty rate) but it is only mid October and I dread going to school every single morning. I am afraid that I am not cut out to be a teacher, at least not a full time one. I would love to be a substitute or a teaching assistant again but they do not pay as well obviously. I am worried that the responsibilities and the difficulties that come with teaching public high school are too much for me. Is what I am going through normal for a first year teacher? Should I stay in this field or should I just leave at the end of the summer?

highschoolteachers,"But is not unfair to the stronger students? Who will not get the same type of helpful advice that the weaker students are receiving? I had to peer review a research argument for one of my classes the other night that sparked this question. The argument I was reviewing was honestly unreadable. There was no research question or thesis statement, the grammar and punctuation was not good, and the overall organization of the argument made it so that I had no idea what my peer was talking about or what he was researching. This put me in an incredibly uncomfortable position, because I had to type up notes and share them with him in class today, but I did not want to have to tell him that almost every aspect of his paper needed work. So when I typed up my comments, I really put a lot of energy into trying to give him constructive criticism without totally shitting on his paper. It took me about an hour and a half. When we went over the comments today in class, I spent 25 to 30 minutes going through everything I wrote down with him and explaining my thought process. When it was his turn to show me his comments, he had three bulleted points on a page: ""I like your introduction,"" ""Your sources are reliable,"" and ""I was really interested."" Needless to say, I was frustrated that I would put so much time and effort into trying to help him and got literally nothing helpful or constructive in return. Obviously this particular situation is very specific to my own life, but I cannot even begin to tell you how many times something similar has happened. From your perspective (as a teacher who is pro peer editing), is this truly fair?

I have student highlight their transitions, their evidence, and their elaboration, and grammatical errors with color coding.

This helps my low writers see what a good paper looks like and for my masters to aide the because before I get a headache that is fueled by laziness and lack of effort.

highschoolteachers,"BACKGROUND What grade level do you teach? 9-12 How long have you taught that grade level, and how long have you been teaching overall? --Taught for 5 years, teaching for 7 years LEGISLATION Do you think that the ELL students in your school receive adequate resources to aide their education and, if a high level ELL student, aide in the learning of English as a language? If so, what effective programs are in use? If not, what would you like to see implemented? --I work at a ""newcomer"" high school so students who are new to the country can choose to go here because we have a larger ELL department. I believe we receive ""adequate"" resources because of this designation. I think having a ""newcomer"" school is a good strategy because we can give the extra resources needed to those students who would benefit most. We have many co-taught core classes as well as directed immersion classes. I would like to see more ELL co-teaching/co-planning happening at other schools as leaving it up to the teacher to differentiate for native speakers, non-native speakers, as well as student with NO ENGLISH AT ALL is extremely difficult and over burdensome. In the end though, a weighted per pupil funding approach is the only way ELL students will ever be able to receive more than adequate resources to better attain the English language and get on track with their English speaking peers. Do you conduct a functional behavioral assessment to aid in the instruction of ESE students? Is having this tool effective? Can you give an example of when this worked for you? -- I have never heard of ESE before. ETHICS What kinds of ethics violations have you been aware of during your career? And what types of violations do you consider serious vs. light? Have you ever felt that you made an ethics violation but did not realize it until afterwards? --I have not been involved in unethical situations personally, but have heard of them happening to others. Some I have been aware of: inappropriate student/teacher relationships (severe), inappropriate teacher conduct/language such as cussing during class or at students, grabbing a student, or being demeaning to a student or coworker (severe or light), unprofessional teacher attire (light). STRATEGY What is an instructional strategy that you have perfected and could not teach without? --Attention grabbers - I use 1, 2, 3 and it helps transitioning tremendously. What is a strategy that a new teacher should implement immediately? --SEATING CHARTS!! Also, everyday procedures such as retrieving notebooks from a filing cabinet or a daily opener. Have an attention grabber and classroom rules beyond the basics like respect others (no eating, phone usage procedures, headphones in class, etc.) What is your management style? Is there anything about your management style that you wish you could change? --My management style is calm and organized. I implement procedures and stick to them, and students know what to expect everyday, such as every Monday we do vocabulary, and everyday we begin with 10 minutes of silent reading. The rules are clear and students know what is expected of their behavior. Always stick to a seating chart and do not be afraid to move a student. Give respect and you will get it back (usually).

highschoolteachers,"I think the relationship is actually important. I know in tenth grade I had trouble with geometry, but really enjoyed the class because my teacher for that class, was funny, and she understood my shortcomings and forgave me for it. Of course, I was only really able to build on that relationship because she helped tutor me on that. Sometimes I may have forgotten to do my homework, but she was not *too* harsh on me, she was like ""Come on, Carlos"" and I just generally liked her as a teacher and valued her feedback. To me, it is not a surprise to see some students not care as much about their own learning as much as you do, as a teacher. I think 'learning' would be easier if schools were only for those that wanted to come learn and not the ones who were forced to come there. I think your best bet is to teach in a manner that intrigues students and lures them into wanting to learn about what you are teaching. Generally, I did not find high school really helpful, but the few classes, like hers, I really found value in and I was really glad to be a part of it.

Every student had an assigned laptop they would get at the beginning of the day and carry until the day ended. It was amazing.

I could post powerpoints as soon as I taught them, attach explicit instructions to every dropbox, and send reminders about long term assignments. I never had students complaining that they lost assignments or left something they needed at home. Being able to count on every student having laptop access really opened up what I could do in the classroom, because I did not need to schedule things like writing, researching, or accessing a website around the schedule of a shared space like a library or computer lab. Teaching now at a school where I do not have this luxury, I definitely feel way more limited and that I need to spend more time on trivial things like scheduling computer access, preparing hard copies of literally every material we need, etc. I also feel that students at this school are lacking basic computer skills because the lack of texh avilability encourages teachers to avoid using it.

highschoolteachers,"Please note that I am a high school English teacher with class sizes averaging about 34. I should be clear, I do not think that anyone should have to work crazy hours like we do. SPED teachers who are working IEPs, etc. are the backbone of a school in my humble opinion. The problem I am naming is the teachers who go out of their way telling everyone how they spend every hour of their day working on teaching. I respect those people for what they do, but that should not be our norm. The point is we all have our own systems for teaching our students. Some people need to spend more time, and some do not. The real issue is that those who have to spend more time, like SPED teachers, should have contracts that reflect that work, and pay them accordingly. I personally am fine with good SPED programs being paid higher than my general Ed work. My strategies: I grade portions of essays instead of whole essays. I have week long process papers where I go from student to student to work with them on their work in class so their final essay requires less heavy lifting in terms of grading. I plan our lessons using materials I have, and generating new ideas. Do I spend time outside of the classroom, absolutely, but I Am not going to make anyone who does not do that feel badly for having their own system, and when we see all these teachers getting awards being espoused for the endless hours they spend in the classroom we are pitching a message that that is the only thing that works.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school English, and there is no way I can do all of my stuff by the time the final bell rings. I have two small kids now (4 and 5), and I do not take work home anymore. Instead, I am strict with my time at work: I do all my stuff (goal-setting, phone calls, conferences, ARDs, copies, planning, emails, etc) just during my off period. After school is just for grading, and if I do about an hour a day, it does not become unmanageable. I Have learned a lot of ways to get more efficient: 1. I only check email during my conference, for example. Once or twice (typically right before school and right after school), I will just eyeball it to make sure there is nothing immediate. 2. Make copies for things in batches. This is also handy in case I have an unexpected absence - my copies are already made. 3. I have students trade-and-grade as much as possible. Your bad class may not be able to do this, but just ask your best class to do it in exchange for a jolly rancher. Jolly ranchers are cheap and do not trigger common allergies. Remember that trade-and-grade does NOT violate FERPA. 4. Save heavy socializing/venting for happy hour.

highschoolteachers,"One of the elements that I think is unfairly neglected in these conversations is the anxiety that grade inflation causes high school students. I teach at a fairly prestigious, all-girl Catholic school. The students are insanely stressed out, despite rampant grade inflation. Our median weighted GPA (including electives) is over 3.7! In my experience, I literally cannot give a grade below a B-, unless the student has actively not completed work. If the student is utterly incompetent, but turned everything in on time, she will probably get a B. We joke that we only give two grades: A, for not so bad, and B, for not so good. Besides the philosophical problems with giving these high grades, I have noticed that the students exist in a perpetual state of stress. In their minds, anything below an A is a failing grade. Because of this, they live in abject fear of getting anything below 100%. I write pretty hard quizzes (considering I am teaching an AP class), and students report studying all hours of the night in fear of them. They cannot experiment, they cannot learn. All they do is worry. Since we have flattened the grading range by so much, they only see success and failure, and the fact of the matter is, there needs to be a place for students who 1. are not failing, but 2. are not excelling. We just do not have that.",one element think unfairly neglected conversation anxiety grade inflation cause student teach fairly prestigious girl catholic student insanely stressed despite rampant grade inflation median weighted gpa including elective experience literally cannot give grade i unless student actively completed work student utterly incompetent turned everything time probably get i joke give two grade bad i good besides philosophical problem giving grade noticed student exist perpetual state stress mind anything failing grade live abject fear getting anything write pretty hard quiz considering teaching ap class student report studying hour night fear cannot experiment cannot learn worry since flattened grading range much see success failure fact matter need place student failing excelling
highschoolteachers,"What do grades mean outside of school? What do they impact? * Good grades impact college scholarships, so they are important for lightening student debt burden * Good grades impact acceptance into the elite colleges (if your parents do not have the money to buy your way in) * Bad grades keep you from getting a high school diploma and put you on the school-to-prison path That is about all I can come up with. We see everything through our lenses of being in the trenches every day, dealing with poor attitudes and poor current-fad education programs, and our rose-tinted lenses of how much better school was ""back in our day"" when we did not mess around and if you could not cut it, you did not pass. We take it personally and get offended when a kid does not make any effort until a week before the end of the quarter and refuse to let them turn in missing work. We focus on the ""life lessons"" of deadlines and following procedure and grade on that rather than our curriculum. I think it is important to pull back, distance ourselves from our daily battles, and take a wider view of grading, of education, of their purposes, and of our purposes. To see the forest for the trees, to make sure we are not calling a molehill a mountain.

highschoolteachers,It is like grade inflation is bad but at the same time you have to realize how much relies on grades. I had to keep a pretty high GPA to keep some scholarships and a lot of other students do to. Even in high school to start getting a scholarship I needed to have a certain HS GPA. Yes C was an average back in the 70s but college was way cheaper. A C would not end your college career. While teaching in college I tried not to make stuff too easy but instead offer a lot of support but my supervisor was really strict on wanting all the graduate teachers to get a certain student evaluation average. I know other teachers who got better reviews than me by basically having the test review be the test but slightly different wording and here I am trying to put together some crosswords and matching and putting page numbers by where you can look up the answer. I think if things relied less on grades it would be better and grades would be more accurate. How silly is it that if you got a B in one class instead of an A your GPA might slip enough you lose a scholarship? That puts a lot of pressure on teachers too since teacher reviews are related to what grade student expect to receive and you never know when your students one letter grade lower in your class puts them under some GPA boundary for some scholarship they would probably leave college without.,like grade inflation bad time realize much relies grade keep pretty gpa keep scholarship lot student even start getting scholarship needed certain i gpa yes i average back college way cheaper i would end college career teaching college tried make stuff easy instead offer lot support supervisor really strict wanting graduate teacher get certain student evaluation average know teacher got better review basically test review test slightly different wording trying put together crossword matching putting page number look answer think thing relied le grade would better grade would accurate silly got i one class instead gpa might slip enough lose scholarship put lot pressure teacher since teacher review related grade student expect receive never know student one letter grade lower class put gpa boundary scholarship would probably leave college without

highschoolteachers,"I am of two minds on this. For the teacher side of the equation, tech can really help, but it requires learning and understanding how to use it *for your classroom*. Just throwing a new laptop at a teacher and linking, say, Google Classroom is more of a gimmick than actually offering paid training to learn examples of what you can do in Google Classroom. Same thing with Blackboard, or Canvas, or whatever other new thing. And whatever is adopted and used should be the choice of the teacher; not everyone should use Classroom, or Blackboard, or whatever to the same degree, if they do not want to. It has the potential to make classes virtually paperless (I say virtually, because--at least for me--nothing will take the place of a pen-and-paper exam). Tech is beneficial in that I can, for example, randomly generate any number of variations on a problem and have a computer spit out the new solution, rather than solving it over, myself. This is a godsend for preventing cheating on exams, or creating new study guides, etc with the push of a button. But I only know how to do that because I went and found the tech and learned the programming to do that in my own. It is not hard, necessarily, but it is a time-consuming process to learn something new. How many of us have the time or inclination to do the same? Now, for the students: I worry a lot about the closed-source nature of things. Private companies push their tech in to make money, plain and simple. They may advertise lofty ideals about educating our children, but the bottom line is money, especially when it comes to companies that make operating systems and sell computers. (Google, Apple, and Microsoft.) They may make their stuff cheap or free to students... But that is because they know if they get people to learn their product early in life, it creates a dependency: they are far more likely to continue buying products from that company later in life. Why do you think Microsoft became so dominant in the workplace? We were collectively convinced that ""people in business use this, so students should learn it, too"", and then that prophecy fulfilled itself by the people who grew up using Microsoft only being able to use Microsoft, meaning their kids had to learn it, too. We do not teach kids how to *use* their computers; we teach them how to use specific programs in a particular operating system. And even then, we assume kids know how to use this stuff simply because they grew up around it. It is simply not true! And it is doubly-infuriating when the products are clearly inferior. Chromebooks are just terrible. The keyboards do not have number pads, and their tab key is now a ""search for apps"" key. You must have an internet connection to do any work on a Chrome book. You cannot modify the software that is available--if it is not in the locked-down app store, you cannot get it. Docs, Sheets, and Slides try to emulate the Microsoft or Apple alternatives, but do not work well: equation editors are terrible; formatting changes are as unpredictable as Word or Pages; just about the only positive thing is that it let us you upload stuff to a place accessible anywhere (with an internet connection), but Microsoft now has an answer for that, now. I imagine Apple will, too. The only unique thing that Google has is Classroom, but I imagine the other tech companies are working on a competitor. And do not even get me started on the clawed tentacles that textbook companies like Pearson use to try to hook into classes, with their online textbook supplements (priced pretty high, per student), and their custom-designed, mandated-by-law statewide exams (such as PARCC), instead of states developing their own high school graduation exams (often for cheaper and with better-measurable results). Meanwhile, we (as taxpayers) get stuck footing the bill for all these services and products because some principal or supervisor thinks it will be good optics to pursue it and force everyone to use it, whether or not it is actually better than what is already there. Everyone gets distracted thinking that new = better. And private companies profit off of public endeavors. And, for both students and teachers: I worry that tech companies are gathering data on us to sell to advertisers, among other things. I do not want to participate in the normalization of this data collection--rather, I want to be part of fighting against it. Our lives should not be all uploaded for private companies to pore over, catalog, and market to, or for governments to surveil. The tools I use should be open-source, for all to see, inspect, modify, and improve. That is the very ideal of what we strive for, as teachers, right? That information about the world is open; that anyone can contribute and improve what we all use. And the ability to reach those goals are severely limited by this rent-seeking behavior. tl;dr tech, when implemented well, can be very helpful. But the way most tech is implemented now means that whatever aid is offered is often canceled out by net negative social impacts.",two mind teacher side equation tech really help requires learning understanding use classroom throwing new laptop teacher linking say google classroom gimmick actually offering paid training learn example google classroom thing blackboard canvas whatever new thing whatever adopted used choice teacher everyone use classroom blackboard whatever degree want potential make class virtually paperless say virtually least nothing take place pen paper exam tech beneficial example randomly generate number variation problem computer spit new solution rather solving godsend preventing cheating exam creating new study guide etc push button know went found tech learned programming hard necessarily time consuming process learn something new many u time inclination student worry lot closed source nature thing private company push tech make money plain simple may advertise lofty ideal educating child bottom line money especially come company make operating system sell computer google apple microsoft may make stuff cheap free student know get people learn product early life creates dependency far likely continue buying product company later life think microsoft became dominant workplace collectively convinced people business use student learn prophecy fulfilled people grew using microsoft able use microsoft meaning kid learn teach kid use computer teach use specific program particular operating system even assume kid know use stuff simply grew around simply true doubly infuriating product clearly inferior chromebooks terrible keyboard number pad tab key search apps key must internet connection work chrome book cannot modify software available locked app store cannot get doc sheet slide try emulate microsoft apple alternative work well equation editor terrible formatting change unpredictable word page positive thing let u upload stuff place accessible anywhere internet connection microsoft answer imagine apple unique thing google classroom imagine tech company working competitor even get started clawed tentacle textbook company like pearson use try hook class online textbook supplement priced pretty per student custom designed mandated law statewide exam parce instead state developing graduation exam often cheaper better measurable result meanwhile taxpayer get stuck footing bill service product principal supervisor think good optic pursue force everyone use whether actually better already everyone get distracted thinking new better private company profit public endeavor student teacher worry tech company gathering data u sell advertiser among thing want participate normalization data collection rather want part fighting life uploaded private company pore catalog market government surveil tool use open source see inspect modify improve ideal strive teacher right information world open anyone contribute improve use ability reach goal severely limited rent seeking behavior to do tech implemented well helpful way tech implemented mean whatever aid offered often canceled net negative social impact

highschoolteachers,"It definitely has its ups and downs. Coming from my experiences as a high school teacher, I personally find the use of tech in the classroom be more burden than blessing. My biggest pet peeve with it is that students do not know how to use it responsibly (i.e. they will use their device to play games, access social media when they should be doing their work in class). There is also the fact that some apps allow kids to cheat or cut corners in their learning--for example, there is a translator app offered by Google that allows students to take a picture of a document in another language, and translate it directly to their native language, as opposed to trying to read it for themselves (which is a serious problem if this app is being used for a language-learning course). I like to upload handouts on Google Classroom to save on photocopying costs, yet from personal experience, notice that many students will choose not to complete these handouts or are more likely to forget to do them unless they are on a physical piece of paper. Add that to the fact that I have to play the role of tech support when students do not know how to upload a homework assignment or register for an account; and technology can honestly be such a headache. However, this is not to say that I completely frown on the use tech in school. Services like Quizlet, Padlet, YouTube, Kahoot and Google Drive offer many fun and innovative ways for students to collaborate and review course material. For someone who has horrific handwriting, I also like that I can type up my notes and display them through an LCD projector instead of writing them on the board. But the system does have its drawbacks. Students using their devices irresponsibly, tied with the fact that they feel that using it in the classroom is a right instead of a privilege, are just two of them.",definitely ups down coming experience teacher personally find use tech classroom burden blessing biggest pet peeve student know use responsibly e use device play game access social medium work class also fact apps allow kid cheat cut corner learning example translator app offered google allows student take picture document another language translate directly native language opposed trying read serious problem app used language learning course like upload handout google classroom save photocopying cost yet personal experience notice many student choose complete handout likely forget unless physical piece paper add fact play role tech support student know upload homework assignment register account technology honestly headache however say completely frown use tech service like quiet pallet youtube cahoot google drive offer many fun innovative way student collaborate review course material someone horrific handwriting also like type note display led projector instead writing board system drawback student using device irresponsibly tied fact feel using classroom right instead privilege two

highschoolteachers,"I do not really have explicit advice, but I can empathize. Listen, most teachers can reflect back on their time as a student and think of the best and the worst teacher they had. My worst teacher was a history teacher in high school. Same time of thing. Literally all work was only copying glossary notes and dates. Tests were the stock, textbook tests which were brutally difficult because we literally never covered anything. It sucks, and I wish it was not like this, but for every stellar teacher, there is a pretty bad one. My overall point is that unfortunately, there may not be much you can do. You can try to have a parent call, or appeal. Make sure you HAVE EVERYTHING IN WRITING. Any time you talk to the teacher about assignments/grades make sure it is through e-mail.

highschoolteachers,"Well, I teach in California, I was a sub for a bit, and I was a paraprofessional before all that, so I comment on your post with a degree of certainty behind my words. Points 1, 2, and 3 are spot on. Public perception of what education is like is usually informed by movies, and other popular media. People, including teachers, hold misconceptions about what it is like to teach at different levels. For some reason, they think public high school must be like teaching in a warzone. Having taught in all three levels, I can assure you without a doubt that high school is the easiest (for many of the reasons you mentioned). There is no more hand holding, and the students are at a level where you can now have serious and meaningful discussions on all manner of topics which, for me at least, is fulfilling. Points 4 and 5 are not exactly correct. To begin with, in my district, once subs work a certain number of days a year they are entitled to benefits. Also, it is not a ""dead end job."" Many subs who do this as a career make much more than teachers at the lower half of the salary table. This is because there is a difference between the pay for long-term subbing and day-to-day subbing. Long-term subbing pays much more but requires you to take on much more responsibility. I know several subs who go year after year subbing like this and they make much more money than I do as a 6th year teacher. Secondly, there are people who use this kind of work as contingency for what they really like doing. Here in LA, lots of subs are actors, musicians, artists, grad students, business owners, etc. I am assuming that when one of these people go on a date they do not refer to themselves as subs but rather what they are passionate about. This leads me to a side point I just want to mention. Substitute teachers are some of the weirdest people I have ever met. I do not know if anyone else will agree with me on this. Point 6 is not my case at all. Many of the teachers I have met fall into three distinct categories. The first is the wife/husband of a high earning lawyer, doctor, or other high earning professional. They teach for the love of it or because they simply wanted to feel that they used their education for something, but they do not need to because their partner makes far more than they ever could. And YES, I do agree with you, these people tend to be oblivious about the realities many of their students have to contend with. So, during distance learning they assume everyone has a wonderful little office space like they do from which to zoom and do work, when in reality they live in a single and are trying to zoom in a corner of their bunk bed because their family is walking around and there is no privacy. They then have the gall to demand student turn their cameras on putting them in an uncomfortable, and dare I say, vulnerable position. Of course they have great internet access at their large middle class home, but their students do not, so by having everyone turn their cameras on it drops everyone is bandwidth and everything gets choopy and pixelated for them. The second is the teacher who has put his/her years of education to work outside of the classroom by opening a business, investing, or earning on side gigs related to education (tutoring, daycare, home school, etc.) Teaching has becomes secondary to something else and they hang around for the benefits, and some because they love teaching. The third is the teacher who is laser focused on the career and is either planning to move up to administrative position later, or simply wants to continue teaching. I am in this category. These teachers are not middle class at all. I would consider them working class, if that. They make less than the people who come to repair the air conditioning systems at school. I know, I have asked. Finally, about paraprofessionals. I would say it is a mixed bag. Some, especially from a substitute's perspective can be helpful.

highschoolteachers,"I worked twenty years as a graphic designer before I switched to teaching high school art 15 years ago. I really think the stress is pretty similar.

In certain seasons you may have to work 80-90 hour weeks, while in others you can just about phone it in.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; This information could then inform the teacher's instruction for this student; That is just it though; what are the scenarios that lead to a student reading ""pony"" for ""horse?"" A student educated in a strong phonics program would be very unlikely to even make this particular kind of mistake in the first place. So to target this particular problem, the teacher differentiates some instruction they includes more phonics, or some specific strategies, as you say. But now you are implementing one program in order to deal with the deficits of another program when that other program helped to because the deficit *in the first place.* Research shows that phonics instruction paired with 3-queing just does not work because after students finish their phonics lesson, and they sit down to read and begin using context and pictures instead of phonics to learn to read (and this is why the student reads pony instead of horse) this *actively* weakens the phonics instruction they just had - and they continue to struggle. On one level, this makes sense: give students as many strategies as they can use and cultivate their ability to select the right strategy for the job. Let them use the pictures and context to identify the words on the page, and when that fails sound out the word. But human beings ***do not identify the words on the page through the strategies taught by 3-cueing.*** Pictures and context do help them to develop *meaning* but not identify words. Cognitive research fully bears this out. You are not *reading* if you are getting the gist of a passage by skipping words and relying on predictive guesses and picture referencing, If a student is ""attending to meaning"" but not ""letter sound correspondence"" they cannot really be said to be reading, strictly speaking, because what they are doing is unmoored from what is actually printed on the page. **English characters correspond to sounds** so if you are getting your meaning from, say memorizing entire words as individual pictures or ideograms, looking at the pictures, or memorizing sentence patterns you are not actually interacting with the English language that is actually on the page in the way that English actually works. 3-cueing is not just another window into a student's mind or another strategy in a student's toolbox. It actively undermines the other tools he has. From the guy responsible for the 3-cueing system, Ken Goodman, [interviewed last year](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.apmreports.org/amp/episode/2019/08/22/what is-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading): &gt;When I asked him what he makes of the cognitive science research, he told me he thinks scientists focus too much on word recognition. He still does not believe accurate word recognition is necessary for reading comprehension. &gt; ""Word recognition is a preoccupation,"" he said. ""I do not teach word recognition. I teach people to make sense of language. And learning the words is incidental to that."" &gt; He brought up the example of a child who comes to the word ""horse"" and says ""pony"" instead. His argument is that a child will still understand the meaning of the story because horse and pony are the same concept. &gt; I pressed him on this. First of all, a pony is not the same thing as a horse. Second, do not you want to make sure that when a child is learning to read, he understands that /p/ /o/ /n/ /y/ says ""pony""? And different letters say ""horse""? &gt; He dismissed my question. &gt; ""The purpose is not to learn words,"" he said. ""The purpose is to make sense."" ... &gt; Goodman rejected the idea that you can make a distinction between skilled readers and unskilled readers; he does not like the value judgment that implies. He said dyslexia does not exist despite lots of evidence that it does. ---------------- Research shows that a significant proportion of students will learn to read adequately in almost any reading program. There is a lot of other factors apart from curriculum. Which means that there is always going to be some amount of evidence ""showing"" that 3-cueing works. &gt; But some children will skip the sounding out if they are taught they have other options. Phonics is challenging for many kids. The cueing strategies seem quicker and easier at first. And by using context and memorizing a bunch of words, many children can look like good readers until they get to about third grade, when their books begin to have more words, longer words, and fewer pictures. Then they are stuck. They have not developed their sounding-out skills. Their bank of known words is limited. Reading is slow and laborious and they do not like it, so they do not do it if they do not have to. While their peers who mastered decoding early are reading and teaching themselves new words every day, the kids who clung to the cueing approach are falling further and further behind. &gt; These poor reading habits, once ingrained at a young age, can follow kids into high school. Some kids who were taught the cueing approach never become good readers. Not because they are incapable of learning to read well but because they were taught the strategies of struggling readers. ----------------- Automatic word recognition is the best marker for strong reading skills because reading requires word recognition. The way in which human brains do that is by linking characters on the page to sounds, and then associating those sounds with a word they already know through background knowledge. *Not* by ""attending to meaning"" as if this could be done without attending to the letters on the page. The letters are the only thing on the page which can even be read. They represent sounds. The only way anybody reads, strictly speaking, is by attending to letter-sound correspondence. If students are ""attending to meaning* in the way that you are talking about, and the teacher is then devising lessons and practice opportunities to help the student ""attend to letter-sound correspondence,"" 1 of 2 things is going on: **1.** You have a student who is learning to read and a teacher is using phonics go teach them to read. Or **2.** The teacher is teaching students the skills of struggling readers and then is creating additional (phonics) lessons in order to teach the student how to read. Looking at pictures, using context clues, memorizing sentence patterns, memorizing whole words as pictures are what struggling readers do. They are what readers do when either decoding *fails* or the reader does not have the background to connect a properly decoded word with background knowledge. If students are ""attending to meaning"" when they read and are then receiving phonics instruction as a corrective measure, things are being done backwards: they are being asked to determine and construct meaning *before* they understand what is printed on the page, when not is what printed on the page that determines meaning. By ""attending to meaning"" in a way that does not attend to ""letter sound correspondence"" a child is doing any number of important and necessary activities related to reading *apart from actually reading.* Again, this is not *reading*, but an ancillary bundle of skills that help to create meaning and supplement reading skills when word identification and ""attending to letter-sound correspondence"" breaks down.",it information could inform teacher instruction student though scenario lead student reading pony horse student educated strong phonics program would unlikely even make particular kind mistake first place target particular problem teacher differentiates instruction includes phonics specific strategy say implementing one program order deal deficit another program program helped deficit first place research show phonics instruction paired queuing work student finish phonics lesson sit read begin using context picture instead phonics learn read student read pony instead horse actively weakens phonics instruction continue struggle one level make sense give student many strategy use cultivate ability select right strategy job let use picture context identify word page fails sound word human being identify word page strategy taught cueing picture context help develop meaning identify word cognitive research fully bear reading getting gist passage skipping word relying predictive guess picture referencing student attending meaning letter sound correspondence cannot really said reading strictly speaking unmoored actually printed page english character correspond sound getting meaning say memorizing entire word individual picture ideogram looking picture memorizing sentence pattern actually interacting english language actually page way english actually work cueing another window student mind another strategy student toolbox actively undermines tool guy responsible cueing system ken goodman interviewed last year help wow google com amp wow apmreports org amp episode wrong school teach reading it asked make cognitive science research told think scientist focus much word recognition still believe accurate word recognition necessary reading comprehension it word recognition preoccupation said teach word recognition teach people make sense language learning word incidental it brought example child come word horse say pony instead argument child still understand meaning story horse pony concept it pressed first pony thing horse second want make sure child learning read understands i i say pony different letter say horse it dismissed question it purpose learn word said purpose make sense it goodman rejected idea make distinction skilled reader unskilled reader like value judgment implies said dyslexia exist despite lot evidence research show significant proportion student learn read adequately almost reading program lot factor apart curriculum mean always going amount evidence showing cueing work it child skip sounding taught option phonics challenging many kid cueing strategy seem quicker easier first using context memorizing bunch word many child look like good reader get third grade book begin word longer word fewer picture stuck developed sounding skill bank known word limited reading slow laborious like peer mastered decoding early reading teaching new word every day kid clung cueing approach falling behind it poor reading habit ingrained young age follow kid kid taught cueing approach never become good reader incapable learning read well taught strategy struggling reader automatic word recognition best marker strong reading skill reading requires word recognition way human brain linking character page sound associating sound word already know background knowledge attending meaning could done without attending letter page letter thing page even read represent sound way anybody read strictly speaking attending letter sound correspondence student attending meaning way talking teacher devising lesson practice opportunity help student attend letter sound correspondence thing going student learning read teacher using phonics go teach read teacher teaching student skill struggling reader creating additional phonics lesson order teach student read looking picture using context clue memorizing sentence pattern memorizing whole word picture struggling reader reader either decoding fails reader background connect properly decoded word background knowledge student attending meaning read receiving phonics instruction corrective measure thing done backwards asked determine construct meaning understand printed page printed page determines meaning attending meaning way attend letter sound correspondence child number important necessary activity related reading apart actually reading reading ancillary bundle skill help create meaning supplement reading skill word identification attending letter sound correspondence break

highschoolteachers,"I graduated in Studio Arts and this is my first year teaching. I hated art in high school because it was crafty and not challenging. So I had big plans when I became a teacher. However, even though art class is meant to be the least stressful class, students still have no motivation. The problem I have found, is that students do not have patience and do not know how to critically think (which is my favorite part of art.) They believe it is a talent and get angry when they are not good at it immediately. I use some resources from thevirtualinstructor.com. Also, my favorite book is Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.

highschoolteachers,"I think you might have hit the nail on the the head when you said the counselors were thinking a kid is unlikely to go Ivy League due to us being Title 1. I hate that, however, because I am of the same demographic as my kids and I got out and went to a top tier school on scholarship. I think Dual and AP might be treated in the same category for state rating but the thing is, its not an even exchange numbers wise when they take kids out of the AP program. For one, as I said in my first post, they did not tell all the kids that they needed to enroll in CC to do dual so many missed the enrollment. (Despite hyping it up, they do not bother to let the kids know the requirements of the entrance exam or CC application). Some of those kids have made it back to AP but not all. They also have for the past 3 years been letting kids drop AP with just a transfer form (even if they are freshmen) instead of getting teacher &amp; parent permission. So some kids are just going to regular and messing up the class sizes. We probably lost about 30 kids out of AP this year and the number of kids actually, properly enrolled in Dual? Eight. This is a weird and unique situation at our school that was caused by an incompetent administrator who was apparently incapable of doing math. Previously kids were not allowed to drop out of AP without the teacher &amp; parent signing off. When I realized what was happening the first year of that admins reign, I went to her about it and her response that it was the kids choice. I told her that if I were a parent and my 15 year old dropped all his college prep courses and the school did not notify me, I would be pissed, but she would not budge. The counselors basically told me to fuck off and once kids drop from my roster I lose all access to their records so I cannot call their parents myself, assuming I had that kind of time. Anyway, we went down about 2 letter grades in rating and now we have a new admin who has been taking an active role in rebuilding the AP program. Even after she told the counselors not to, they were still dropping kids from AP without notice, so we have still lost a lot, but she ripped the counselors a new one when she found out and its glorious. Dual does not offer a very authentic experience at my school. Its taught in a high school classroom by a high school teacher and though she has to abide by the community college requirements, since she is employed by the school and not the community college, she also has to answer to all the school district BS too like 2 grades a week, parent phone calls if they do not turn something in, unlimited redos and accepting late work without penalty. When it was taught by one of the CC professors apparently too many kids failed and started their college career with an F on their transcript. I agree that some community colleges teach very good classes. I had some great professors in mine, and I feel like that helped me bridge some of the gaps between my low income high school and my university. But I cannot deny that I felt my college classmates who came in with loads of AP credit were not better prepped, and that I still had lots of gaps compared to them. So that plus the fact that I teach AP and am now team lead of the program in my department probably makes me biased in favor of AP. I also like that having to follow the AP standards shields me in some ways from the latest district BS trend (like banning homework assignments, or telling English teachers they cannot assign novels, or imposing a paint-by-number curriculum) that the regular class teachers are constantly being subjected to.",think might hit nail head said counselor thinking kid unlikely go ivy league due u title hate however demographic kid got went top tier scholarship think dual ap might treated category state rating thing even exchange number wise take kid ap program one said first post tell kid needed enroll ca dual many missed enrollment despite hyping bother let kid know requirement entrance exam ca application kid made back ap also past year letting kid drop ap transfer form even freshman instead getting teacher amp parent permission kid going regular messing class size probably lost kid ap year number kid actually properly enrolled dual eight weird unique situation caused incompetent administrator apparently incapable math previously kid allowed drop ap without teacher amp parent signing realized happening first year admins reign went response kid choice told parent year old dropped college prep course notify would pissed would budge counselor basically told fuck kid drop roster lose access record cannot call parent assuming kind time anyway went letter grade rating new admin taking active role rebuilding ap program even told counselor still dropping kid ap without notice still lost lot ripped counselor new one found glorious dual offer authentic experience taught classroom teacher though abide community college requirement since employed community college also answer district i like grade week parent phone call turn something unlimited redos accepting late work without penalty taught one ca professor apparently many kid failed started college career i transcript agree community college teach good class great professor mine feel like helped bridge gap low income university cannot deny felt college classmate came load ap credit better prepped still lot gap compared plus fact teach ap team lead program department probably make biased favor ap also like follow ap standard shield way latest district i trend like banning homework assignment telling english teacher cannot assign novel imposing paint number curriculum regular class teacher constantly subjected

highschoolteachers,"&gt;AP courses have a nationally standardized measure - the exam. Dual credit courses do not, so top tier universities tend not to count them because they have no way to measure the quality of instruction; the university I went to was included in this. I was not attempting to argue otherwise. This does not mean that all schools universally accept AP credit simply because one took the College Board's exams. I would say that a great argument is to look no further than the debacle of last year's exams to see why many schools are beginning to balk at AP exams in regards to the questions of their equity. &amp;#x200B; &gt;They allowed me to take a test to test out of English, but that was only one class out of many. My high school did not offer AP so I spent money on community college without realizing it would not transfer. And conversely, with regards to English, there are some universities which will only accept AP English Language as opposed to AP English Literature or vice-versa. This becomes even more varied when one considers certain majors/programs at certain schools will or will not accept AP results for certain exams. The most known school in my state meets all of these requirements and is a major reason why so many of our students end up opting to not take AP exams 2 weeks before it is time to test because they have found out they are accepted and realize the school does not take AP English Lit (the one we offer as opposed to Lang). Or - even better - they go into the test and dick around and score 1s and 2s since their score does not matter and because they do not think it impacts the teacher (God, I hate that!) &amp;#x200B; &gt; Our dual program currently has an agreement with local universities to transfer credit but the universities have not been impressed with the quality of student coming out of our dual program so even that is in jeopardy. Sadly, this may be more common than you think. However, in some cases there are also local CCs that provide superior instruction to bigger universities. &amp;#x200B; &gt;I try to counsel my students to research what credits their goal-universities will or will not take. My problem with the counselors is they sell dual as superior to AP when each has different pros and cons, and instead of focusing on the kids who would benefit from dual the most (the ones who want to go a non traditional route and work while doing CC then transferring later) they instead recruit the top 25% of the class (the AP kids) because they know they will be able to pass the exam for community college (when the counselors bother to tell them about it) without additional prep. I cannot speak to your counselors' rationale but one possible point of rationale they may have for suggesting Dual Enrollment over AP is to give students a more ""authentic"" collegiate experience. Many first generation college students drop out, not because they are incapable, but because they feel overwhelmed. Dual Enrollment can give an exposure that AP simply cannot. And also allow for the chance of a articulation agreement with guaranteed transfer to a 4-year state school, though not all states have this (I am only aware of CA, PA, DE, and NC at this point). That said, **I appreciate seeing a teacher such as yourself taking an active role in these conversations with students.** I wish some of my teaching staff would do the same. &amp;#x200B; &gt;For example, they convinced the valedictorian to drop AP for dual without bothering to check that her first choice school (an Ivy) will not take dual credit. Like, they did not even ask, just assured her it would be better, and she had to change her schedule again when she found out. That is unprofessional on their part but I do wonder if some of their perspective dealt with a financial standpoint. Though I believe you said you are a Title I school so the valedictorian is likely to get merit and need-based aid covering much of an Ivy's tuition. &amp;#x200B; &gt;But its difficult when the counselors are making it this weird tug of war and telling kids, even the Valedictorian, that they are not going to pass the AP test anyway so Dual is a safer bet. Its just bizarre to me that they do this, not only because it can harm kids, but also when AP enrollment drops, so does the schools state rating. That last sentence seems weird as in my state, Dual Enrollment and AP enrollment are treated equally in school report cards from the state. Honestly, I would say - if it has not happened - you and your counseling department definitely need to sit down and have a chat and see where both sides are coming from. It appears you both have the intent of doing what is best for the kids but maybe very drastically different paths in doing it. This is why I absolutely love my English department and love interacting with them to be honest, because they make every effort to be on the same page with me.",it ap course nationally standardized measure exam dual credit course top tier university tend count way measure quality instruction university went included attempting argue otherwise mean school universally accept ap credit simply one took college board exam would say great argument look debacle last year exam see many school beginning balk ap exam regard question equity amp i i it allowed take test test english one class many offer ap spent money community college without realizing would transfer conversely regard english university accept ap english language opposed ap english literature vice versa becomes even varied one considers certain major program certain school accept ap result certain exam known state meet requirement major reason many student end opting take ap exam week time test found accepted realize take ap english lit one offer opposed lang even better go test dick around score since score matter think impact teacher god hate amp i i it dual program currently agreement local university transfer credit university impressed quality student coming dual program even jeopardy sadly may common think however case also local ca provide superior instruction bigger university amp i i it try counsel student research credit goal university take problem counselor sell dual superior ap different pro con instead focusing kid would benefit dual one want go non traditional route work ca transferring later instead recruit top class ap kid know able pas exam community college counselor bother tell without additional prep cannot speak counselor rationale one possible point rationale may suggesting dual enrollment ap give student authentic collegiate experience many first generation college student drop incapable feel overwhelmed dual enrollment give exposure ap simply cannot also allow chance articulation agreement guaranteed transfer year state though state aware ca pa de no point said appreciate seeing teacher taking active role conversation student wish teaching staff would amp i i it example convinced valedictorian drop ap dual without bothering check first choice ivy take dual credit like even ask assured would better change schedule found unprofessional part wonder perspective dealt financial standpoint though believe said title valedictorian likely get merit need based aid covering much ivy tuition amp i i it difficult counselor making weird tug war telling kid even valedictorian going pas ap test anyway dual safer bet bizarre harm kid also ap enrollment drop school state rating last sentence seems weird state dual enrollment ap enrollment treated equally report card state honestly would say happened counseling department definitely need sit chat see side coming appears intent best kid maybe drastically different path absolutely love english department love interacting honest make every effort page

Additionally, the idea that remote learning replaces in-person learning can be explained by the inadequacies of in-person learning. Another factor could just be that online learning is less efficient than in-person learning at imparting information and could be slower, but what is required of students is so low that that threshold becomes irrelevant. Adding to this, it really depends on so many other factors like how the online teaching is implemented, what age group, how are the students generally, etc.",multiple way looking academically socially intellectually etc think like people said see lot similar level achievement one factor kid life especially time performance certain extent already overdetermined variable additionally idea remote learning replaces person learning explained inadequacy person learning another factor could online learning le efficient person learning imparting information could slower required student low threshold becomes irrelevant adding really depends many factor like online teaching implemented age group student generally etc

highschoolteachers,"I think that Montessori has a good framework. The idea of children being able to explore and create and being naturally driven to do so is both true but also does not account for outside factors. Students in title one schools who are not regularly getting fed and have awful home lives are not going to do the whole ""Montessori"" thing. They are going to go and just want to curl into a ball and hide from everyone and in a less structured environment very well may do so. There is also the fact that while everyone would agree that there is some baseline of educational achievement a student must do (for example, being able to comfortably and proficiently read at grade level) ultimately Montessori is fundamentally incompatible with most modern educational standards. This is only accentuated when you realize that these kids are not going to specialized Montessori middle and high schools. In fact, Maria Montessori has almost nothing written on Middle and High outside of ""middle schoolers are too impulsive and dumb to be expected to learn so your job is to give them something to do and wait for them to mature into high schoolers where they can be put into apprenticeships"" which is loaded with problems. There are also crippling issues with the fact that ultimately there has not been any kind of progress in this field in a century. Students from Montessori schools (unless parents are obscenely wealthy enough to afford private tutors and high tier private schools and such) are simply dumped right back into the local Public-Private school system where all of the things they had learned in Montessori (thinking critically, independent research) are punished ***harshly*** in pursuit of just teaching to standards and simply becoming an ""acceptable receptacle"" to learning. Thus, when students are put back into Public and Private schools, they end up even worse off than if they were just kept in a public elementary school anyways. To be able to make Montessori work, either a.) some kind of major work has to be done on applying the ideals of Montessori education to difficult subjects and future-focused students and b.) there has to be infrastructure built around that. This means either, instead of having teachers, having experts in multiple fields who work at the school and help guide students along through difficult topics *or* teaching students email etiquette and how to read difficult works and such. Both of these have massive problems (hiring a team of experts both inevitably means that there are major knowledge gaps, while I am sure that professors and forerunners in their fields do not want to respond to an eighth grader's repeated attempts at asking what a quasar is and will write your school some very... colorful letters and emails if students are allowed to continue), along with the fact that by nature this is basically throwing most of the local educational systems to the side in support of a few private schools.

The other is Dual is not rigorous and the local universities that take it are constantly threatening to stop accepting the credit because kids with dual credit are not coming to college at a remedial level.",call every year past admin useless went liked rather competent leadership change hopefully counselor held accountable also work title kid get ap exam free cost either ap dual reason push ap many state university accept ca credit whereas almost take ap score dual rigorous local university take constantly threatening stop accepting credit kid dual credit coming college remedial level

highschoolteachers,"I am also a high school English teacher, so I recognize that its possible to teach controversial and upsetting texts with the right amount of nuance and support, and I Am sure that you provide that. I love the idea of analyzing the concept of what it means to be a teenager across time and definitely want to incorporate that next time I teach CITR. That aside, I do not think this is the year for 13RW. Suicides tend to cluster and if I lost a friend as a vulnerable high schooler in an uncertain time, I would already be considering the option. I think that even with nuance and support, 13RW is too much. What about beginning next week with a short story that might give you a little more time to flesh out a larger study of a novella or something? Or even watching a movie about modern teen life and analyzing that as a text? Maybe Love, Simon? That would really provide some additional content about how being a teen has changed in juxtaposition with the homophobia in CITR. I do not know. Just a few thoughts.

highschoolteachers,"Had my first cheating incident today. I am 26 and a second year teacher. I have really grown a backbone and some confidence over the past year, but I was still super nervous about my first time potentially punishing a high school kid. I have gotten to the point where I feel like a Real Adult with middle school kids, but high school kids sometimes seem like a weird in-between category where I do not like to flex my authority unless I really have to. Well, I really had to, and here is how it went down. A kid was accused by two witnesses of using a note sheet. I pull him out of study hall, play omniscient cop, and he confesses to asking the kid next to him for some answers. Denies using the note sheet. Whatever. I have a confession, the details are less important. I tell him thank you for your honesty, I am going to talk to the guy who helped you cheat, you can go back to study hall. I psych myself up for round two and follow maybe a minute later to the same fucking study hall and ask his cheating partner to come with me. It is literally mind blowing they did not like text each other or attempt to coordinate their stories during this time. It is even more mind blowing that after witnessing his friend mysteriously leave with a teacher and come back, then being asked by the same teacher if there is anything he needs to say about the test, the second kid did not think that maybe the cat was out of the bag and he should acknowledge he has SOME idea what this might be about, even to say like, ""You probably suspect me and X of cheating but it is not what it looks like..."" He admits to it in the end after I tell him his friend confessed. His defense? ""I did not cheat. I did not use any of his answers. I was trying to be helpful."" I told them I will let you know on Monday what is going to happen. Talked to my admin, who was very supportive and basically said it is up to me, I can let them retake if I want, probably a good idea to contact parents. I am going to let them marinate over the weekend, then on Monday ask them to retake. (I kind of think they cheated on more portions than they admitted to, and the retake will make it clear if that is the case. I will not like...pursue it, but it will give me a better idea of how strongly to suspect future dishonesty.) And give them the choice of me writing an email to their parents, or writing it themselves. Honestly that part will feel like a punishment for me too, but it is the right thing to do (ugh). So I have to marinate over the weekend too. But they do not need to know that, because I am the adult and my feelings are irrelevant. Coincidentally, I had already promised the class a treat on Monday for those who did an optional fun assignment, and both of those guys did the assignment. So it is nice that I will have that little tangible way to say, ""This will not affect how I treat you in class,"" without having to actually say it.",first cheating incident today second year teacher really grown backbone confidence past year still super nervous first time potentially punishing kid gotten point feel like real adult kid kid sometimes seem like weird category like flex authority unless really well really went kid accused two witness using note sheet pull study hall play omniscient cop confesses asking kid next answer denies using note sheet whatever confession detail le important tell thank honesty going talk guy helped cheat go back study hall psych round two follow maybe minute later fucking study hall ask cheating partner come literally mind blowing like text attempt coordinate story time even mind blowing witnessing friend mysteriously leave teacher come back asked teacher anything need say test second kid think maybe cat bag acknowledge idea might even say like probably suspect i cheating look like admits end tell friend confessed defense cheat use answer trying helpful told let know monday going happen talked admin supportive basically said let retake want probably good idea contact parent going let marinate weekend monday ask retake kind think cheated portion admitted retake make clear case like pursue give better idea strongly suspect future dishonesty give choice writing email parent writing honestly part feel like punishment right thing ugh marinate weekend need know adult feeling irrelevant coincidentally already promised class treat monday optional fun assignment guy assignment nice little tangible way say affect treat class without actually say

highschoolteachers,"Yes, you are correct and I agree. We knew that going in to the profession. We knew it when we started college . We knew it when we started our teaching program and we knew it when we applied to get a teaching license or certificate. We knew it when we applied for 'teacher' at the school district. It is not new. Yes, in the United States salary does have the ""give-and-take"" connotation. And that is a personal decision when choosing a profession and applied to be compensated with a salary wage. I also think that third is a hidden truth or additional underlying reason for choosing to be a salary compensated educator. The lengthy breaks, the path to administration, the work hours are parentally ideal, and many others. We knew about the low pay and the salary but I do not believe any of us consciously understood the gross lack of respect and value some people and places have and it spreads like abuse. I did not realize how poorly educators are viewed and I do not want to say it but it must be a least a small variable in play, gender. I saw a post in this thread asking how many people have been called 'mom' or 'dad' or, when I was 28 , 'grandma'? Think about that. That is not an endearing to be called a parental pronoun. It almost equivalent to calling a penis your, my, a ""Johnson"". Nobody would want to accidentally call their boss mom or dad. Imagine a doctor calling the chief of medicine 'mom' or 'dad' or anyone calling a judge in court mom or grandpa. I am pretty sure any judge would not take that favorably. Because it is degrading. It is not degrading to be a mother to be a father or a grandparent because moms, dads, grandmas, are, were or will be a professional outside of being a parent. I do not understand how educators are trusted with the future, with other people's children, given full access to young minds and then valued so little. That is a messed up, ass backwards, goddamnit where the f@?k am I? Stupid, stupid system. I chose education because I love education. I was told that it was not financially wise to be a student for the rest of my life. The best choice for continuing in school and not pay for it was to become a teacher. I also believed and now only dream of education being a entity that has a ""separation of church and state"". I believe that ork is a place for work. I do not understand employers and businesses trying to integrate anything personal with work beyond a work philosophy. That is the biggest waste of productivity invented. It is devious as a 'business' driven idea. Devious and manipulative way to attract employees and customers, clients, etc. I do not know about your school but every school I have ever been in has Bible study available each week during lunch and the school districts here rent space from the neighboring churches. We invite them into our schools that we rent space from them as well. Good ole American ""separation of church and state."" No wonder our language is messed up and difficult to learn and why education is not valued and teachers are mocked as professionals. All our students grow up with misrepresentations, double meanings, convoluted definitions, idioms and hypocrites. We have all heard I, you, we ""did not get into for the money..."". No, no I did not. I also did not get into it to be treated like a babysitter with a high school diploma. And if we were paid at babysitter rate we would not be complaining.

highschoolteachers,"I also blame parents when it comes to cell phone use. Many parents either ignore screen time because it serves as a babysitter or because they are addicted to phones (and the drama) themselves. Obviously, compared to high school 30 years ago (me) there is a whole new undercurrent of communication going on due to smartphones being instantly-accessed mini computers, cameras AND telephones. In class the phones are used for""passing notes"" texts, and sharing. Kids want to create and see videos and selfies, and they love to gossip. There are games to play, for God's sake. It is like bringing the telephone, tv, pinball arcade games, and the shopping mall to class. Of course they are distracted. The things on their phones are more interesting than class. The addiction to phones is real. Not just the content, but the actual screen time process is addictive to the brain. The teens I taught with phones do not know anything different and the school will not take away the phones. I see it like this. The schools know they are dealing with addiction, and some kids will go through serious withdrawals, so they cannot act. It is like the reasoning, which is fair, that liquor stores during the pandemic had to stay open or ERs would be flooded with alcoholics going through DTs.

highschoolteachers,"I am not a teacher, but I was a coach for flagline for a few years at a high school. Now our high school ran on block scheduling, and our marching bands were separated into freshman and varsity. Varsity flagline was something the kids had to try out for at the end of the previous school year - freshman flagline was open for any freshman student to participate. All incoming freshman at one time or another recieved information regarding band camp, usually the week before school started. A mom of a freshman student emailed one of the band directors, not me, asking about how to involve her child with flagline. The director gave her the information she needed, and told her that if she had other questions to email me. The mom did, she asked me about equipment she could get her daughter (unnecessary since we supply all equipment, but many students choose to buy their own), and possibly things the kid could work on over the summer. So I email her back with links of the standard equipment kits and YouTube links of basics - no big deal. Flash forward to the first week of school. I get a RAGING email from this mother about how we did NOT reach out to her about band camp and that her daughter was just SO upset when she saw the band practicing during the first week of school. How we also did not tell her that her kid had to be signed up for band class in order to participate. And now it was just TOO LATE for her daughter to join now because she would already be so behind (not really). They wasted so much money on equipment that would be useless now. She was so rude and nothing I said seemed to matter. I told her how her student could talk to a counselor and get her schedule changed and jump right in. Nope.

highschoolteachers,"Our 8th &amp; 9th grade teams piloted this. My daughter was a sophomore and immediately said, ""Then I only have to do 10% of the work to pass."" Our 9th grade English teacher noted that her students turned in poorer quality work under the 50% policy. I find, after a term of many assignments (40+), that students' grades move very little, even if I weight their final project at 25% of their grade. A student who typically scores an 85% is still at 85% at the end of the term even if they have a few 0s. 50% sounds like lowering expectations. I realize this is an educational trend that has been implemented in some geographic areas, and that some researchers are saying it is for ""equity,"" but it really rubs me the wrong way in its wrongness. It feels like grade inflation. Is the student proficient with the subject material? It is hard for me to feel like my kid who came 45 minutes late to first period with me every day and who turned in 6 assignments out of 45 (true story) should earn high school credit for my biology class. If you talk to her, she is really not. She knows from sitting in my classroom that biology involves microscopes and skeletons, but she could not tell you anything meaningful about our major units of study this past term: how life is defined, originated, and evolved, biological molecules, cellular structure and function, or metabolism, or how any of that relates to her own body or medical or space research, or how our taxes support all that. So why should she pass? We would be graduating her as ignorant as when she entered my class in September. What does it mean for a high school to allow kids to slide through to that 60% bar with a 50% boost? I went to the counselor about this kid, because I like her. The counselor said, ""DHS is already involved, she is a very angry kid, the family life is chaotic, we will not see her graduate, the only way she is going to get healthy is by leaving that house, if her mom would just sign the papers for Job Corps she could be out of there and getting some skills.

highschoolteachers,"For 2 reasons: 1) parents always assume that it is going to be the same as how they remember it, despite the fact that was years ago and things change. And their memory is really shitty. So they do not listen to anything that contradicts their assumptions. 2) it is how an unreasonably large number of people live their lives and our culture has begun to value it more. Start looking around and notice how much procrastination culture has taken over. Look at people joking about doing things last minute. Look at how many people are late to things and act like that is normal and not rude at all. Look at how much people will proudly and loudly put things off until later because it does not *have* to be done right now. As a society we have begun to ""deal with"" things by refusing to look at them, like a toddler pouting in the corner. This thing stresses me out, I will just do it later. I do not want to, I will just do it later. I do not like it, I will do it later. ...Well, surprise, surprise, if it is not the consequences of our own actions... We then make it worse with policies like letting kids turn in horribly late work at full credit. Sure, you have shown me you now have the skill of identifying a metaphor, but what about the skill of getting your damn act together? What about the skill of planning ahead?

highschoolteachers,"Do you want them to only work for a reward or expect something all the time? Go for it. My advice after 13 years in high school ELA, skip ""rewarding"" behavior. Public acknowledgment of good behavior is great, but rewards do not work. Game prizes, cool. Extra credit, even better. Those are natural reward structures that are built on performance goals and work ethic. Focus on developing great guiding questions and thoughtful writing prompts. Avoid a skills-based approach to teaching ELA. Want them to engage? Convince them of why literature is valuable: because it provides insight into the world's that others experience, teaches us more about ourselves and gives us a window into worlds we could never experience on our own. Teach them the. Alien and universality of story telling. Then pick stories that are connected on a central theme. Let your prompts explore questions related to that theme.

Why yes, I do think I Am all that with my oompa-looking ass . To last, we really do need to develop thick skin. It helps to know that these insults come from a dark place and from their own deep insecurities. Its up to us to allow kindness to she would light and love.

highschoolteachers,"As much as I have tried, I just cannot make myself be okay with any minimum grade. Maybe this is insensitive of me. The purpose of school is supposed to prepare students for life. If students are not taught that they can fail if they do not put forth effort, some may be inclined to leave high school thinking they can do nothing and be just fine. Students should be given chances to make up missing assignments, but I just cannot see any way that handing out a passing grade to a kid who did nothing is healthy. Failure may not be possible in some schools, but it is 100% possible in life after school, and if we do not teach students that they can fail, they will inevitably be set up to fail. It also has the potential to create a snowball effect of illiteracy that leaves teachers at each grade level with an even higher hill to climb to get these students educated.",much tried cannot make okay minimum grade maybe insensitive purpose supposed prepare student life student taught fail put forth effort may inclined leave thinking nothing fine student given chance make missing assignment cannot see way handing passing grade kid nothing healthy failure may possible school possible life teach student fail inevitably set fail also potential create snowball effect illiteracy leaf teacher grade level even higher hill climb get student educated

highschoolteachers,"The purpose of Government is set forth in [The YOU.S. Constitution: Preamble](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/preamble/preamble-overview &gt;""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" These are not Rights or Powers, but the guidelines to decide should ""We the People"" do this? Of these purposes of government Promote the General Welfare, Education for All is square in the sights of this point. John Adams [wrote](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-17-02-0232) a bit about the importance of payment for service and education in a democracy. &gt;I want a service which is worth something, I am able and willing to Pay for it. I will not lay myself under any obligation to you by accepting your Gift. I will owe you no gratitude any further than you serve me faithfully the obligation and Gratitude Shall be from you to me, and if you do not do your Duty to me I will be perfectly free to call you to an account and to punish you and if you will not accept of Pay for your service you shall not serve me This is from the middle of the letter on the topic of payment for public services. Specifically he goes on about payment of elected officials, but I think we can assume the same principle includes all public servants. Payment for service should allow a life of dignity. &gt;the social science will never be much improved untill the People unanimously know and Consider themselvs as the fountain of Power and untill they Shall know how to manage it Wisely and honestly. reformation must begin with the Body of the People which can be done only, to affect, in their Educations. **the Whole People must take upon themselvs the Education of the Whole People and must be willing to bear the expences of it.** there should not be a district of one Mile Square without a school in it, not founded by a Charitable individual but maintained at the expence of the People themselvs they must be taught to reverence themselvs instead of adoreing their servants their Generals Admirals Bishops and Statesmen Here he makes clear the importance of the People being an integral part of the system. It gives us ownership of our own destiny together. The rest of the letter John Adams wrote to John Jeb is absolutely fantastic. He goes on to discuss why it is important to create a system that makes people like Martin Luther King jr, Susan B Anthony, Carl Sagan, and Mr Rogers, although he references others like Washington. Good leaders should not be a product of the time, but of the educational system and culture of the people. If a country does not make good leaders then when that leader is gone there is no one to replace them and that culture and movement dies with them. &gt;Instead of Adoring a Washington, Mankind Should applaud the Nation which Educated him. If Thebes owes its Liberty and Glory to Epaminondas, She will loose both when he dies, and it would have been as well if She had never enjoyed a taste of either: but if the Knowledge the Principles the Virtues and Capacities of the Theban Nation produced an Epaminondas, her Liberties and Glory will remain when he is no more: and if an analogous system of Education is Established and Enjoyed by the Whole Nation, it will produce a succession of Epaminandass. In another short work by John Adams, [Thoughts on Government](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Government), [YouTube Reading](https://youtu.be/XIw_BItRLfs), he wrote about the importance of a liberal education for everyone, spared no expense. &gt;Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/pdwq01/ill_just_put_that_on_your_calendar_for_when_youre/hat7pr6?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) is a comment I saw in response to someone complaining about having to take courses outside their area of study to get a bachelor's degree. So much of our population's perspective towards the education system is solely driven towards financial gain and not about personal growth in community alongside financial gain. &gt;I Am now a college professor in bio, but when I was a grad student I was the teaching assistant for a basic bio course aimed at engineers. The first question I got in lab section was Yeah, why do I have to take this course when I do not give a shit about biology and will not use it as an engineer. I said, the political discourse right now is full of discussions that center on biology, such as reproductive rights, climate change, etc. If you do not understand the biological concepts enough to be part of that conversation, we are going to have it without you, and you will be at someone elses mercy. But if you think being informed on decisions that affect your life is a waste of time, go ahead and phone it in. You could have heard a pin drop after. &gt;College educations should be affordable (or free) so that taking non-core classes are not a financial burden, but receiving a well-rounded education that exposes you to more than just your specific, narrow subject is not the villain. Then there is the [story](https://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/harris-rosen/) of Harris Rosen &gt;Having had his own life so radically transformed by education, Rosen knew that this was an area he wanted to focus on, and Tangelo Park was the place. &gt;Tangelo Park is built on land once used for orange groves. Originally built as housing for workers at the nearby Martin Marietta, it has become an isolated residential area. There are few services nearby for residents, and few public transit options. African Americans comprise 90 percent of the community, with many living below the poverty line. &gt;I fell in love with the neighborhood, says Rosen. I knew I wanted to do some type of scholarship program for them. &gt;The Tangelo Park Program, started in 1993, gives every neighborhood child age 2 to 4 access to free preschool. Parents have access to parenting classes, vocational courses and technical training. &gt;For a program that took just one hour and four people to develop, the impact has been wide and deep. Tangelo Park Elementary is now a grade-A school. Every high school senior graduates. &gt;But there is more. Much more. &gt;Every high school graduate who is accepted to a Florida public university, community or state college, or vocational school receives a full Harris Rosen Foundation scholarship, which covers tuition, living and educational expenses through graduation. &gt;Nearly 200 students have earned Rosen scholarships, and of those, 75 percent have graduated from collegethe highest rate among an ethnic group in the nation. Imagine if we did this and more on a national scale.

My school is part of their system although I am a local teacher so my requirements and the way I was hired is different than for a French national. You would have to refer to their hiring process, but I from what I understand the classroom teachers all need to be certified in France (or perhaps locally) and all I know have taught in France for a couple years before going abroad. I am not sure if having taught in France is a requirement or just what my colleagues did though. It is possible that with the current teacher shortage they may consider hiring someone who does not have a teaching credential, but it may not work out to be a long-term position past this teacher shortage. I know people who have subbed for our school without a credential (usually parents) and I could see them hiring someone like that as a long-term sub for the year if they are short teachers. If you do not have a teacher's certification you could work as a classroom assistant. My school has classroom assistants who are all either French nationals or from other French-speaking countries and do not have a teaching credential.

Plus, using technology is a life skill they will need, so it is finding the balance that works best for you and your class. I do have an app for reading online which is great because it gives them such a large variety of books to choose from, but I also give them time where they read physical books, too. I also have an app I can do a lot of grammar practice on which is great because it is corrected automatically and they are given explanations of their mistakes in real time. But, I think it is also important to actually physically do exercises both for physical memory of writing answers as well as having a break from screen time.

highschoolteachers,"This is a difficult topic to broach. Your description almost makes it sound like your expectations are a far-gone dream. I would say the only saving-grace that you have is that the teacher is **you** and not your mentor. When I was student teaching and we had the shift it was obvious. The students actually surprised me and saw me as the new teacher and with that came new procedures. The problem is that my mentor was excellent when it came to classroom management. When I came in I kept pretty much the same rules in place and handled them in the same manner. It worked. You will have to start out knowing that you are going to have issues, but keep in mind that you can slowly chip away at them over time. I can give you some tips: **Do not offer incentives**: By ""incentives"" I mean something like candy. Or a drawing for a prize (at that age they will not like the cheap stuff enough like 7 year olds do). You will go bankrupt from this alone. And it can be a pain to keep track of the incentives given. **Call them out, respectfully**: Most students will respond to being call out by continuing to misbehave. It is usually because you did it wrong. Do not just call their name and say something along the lines of ""shame on you"". For high school students I can usually say ""Tom. Please stop talking you are being rude to me and everyone else."" For **me** that tends to work. I am telling them what is wrong, how they can fix it and giving them perspective [Why is it wrong?]. **Have rules and stick to them**: If there are no rules then create them. If you think it is applicable then *they* can create the rules. If the rules are broken then deal with it. If you have a rule being broken 20 times a day then stick to it. I find that the first 2 weeks of school tend to be crazy. I am getting onto 4-5 people in each class each day, but eventually the numbers dwindle. They start to understand the rules are in place and I am stickin' with  them. **Do not be too friendly**: By this I mean do not go out of your way to be kind to the students. I do this. I am *respectful* to my students. I greet them with a smile. I like most of my students just fine, but I am not going to be relaxed with them. I do not make lessons hard (that is silly), but I expect them to do it. If a student is not working or is being disrespectful I redirect them and eventually chew them out. If they do not have an IEP or the like then they should be working. In my mind, if they are not doing what I am asking and what I am asking is not out of the way then they are being rude. If I spent 4-5 hours creating a weeks worth of lesson plans and activities then I want them working on them. If they are rude to me then I chew them out. **Parents**: I do not know the situation here. If you can contact parents then it is helpful. Generally, parents will let their kid know that you got into touch with them. This can go a long way. **Proximity**: One last thing. At the end of your post you mentioned a few ways to deal with classroom management and I just wanted to give another. Proximity is excellent. This cuts down on the tiny incidents in class. This works for the students that do not normally create problems, but for whatever reason they are being troublesome that day. Walk around the room and look at their work. If someone is talking tap on their desk. If someone is not working tap on their desk.

highschoolteachers,"I agree with your sentiment here. I went through a special education program at UW-Madison and we had the most student teaching compared to other programs (at least the ones I knew people in). I had a full year as a part time practicum in a middle school, then a full year from August through June of student teaching, first semester in elementary and second semester in a high school. I think actually being the classroom and with students while you are learning about pedagogy and such is the best way to go because I think so many of the skills needed to be an effective teacher are difficult to effectively teach someone in a lecture setting. I had to take a bunch of general knowledge/content tests, but I found them pretty easy without studying (and some people in my program actually talked about their difficulty with it) but once you passed those there was not much in way of talking about teaching specific content). I did not feel like they really assessed my ability to teach, but were more so just so they have something they can say they tested my ability somehow. I did have one class on teaching math, but we never did anything with geometry or algebra and seeing the others in my cohort working with the math, I was wondering how much trouble they would have teaching this content when they were not exactly experts in it (but I do realize having content knowledge is only part of what makes a good teacher, but I think it definitely helps as long as you are aware of your expert blindness) If teachers want to be treated like other professionals, I think its important to think about what other professionals have to go through and the caliber of person it takes to pursue them.

highschoolteachers,"One of the organizational issues I had my first couple of years of teaching high school was figuring out what to do with handouts for students that missed class due to absences. I often teach three different subjects every day and have many different handouts. When students come back to class after an absence, they would ask me for copies of the handouts that they missed. Finding the correct handouts (even if I was organized enough to remember where I put them) would take valuable class time and was an annoying distraction. Once I started using file organizers for my handouts, the problem disappeared. I now have several labelled [file organizers](https://879ac722fc7af40a9302-5a0fef95d12e11774ef27c066e288635.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/product/29970.JPG) in an easily accessible place in my classroom. One per course I teach. The organizers are clearly labelled with the course period, and five file holders in it are labelled with the days of the week. I also have file holders labelled with the unit names of each unit in that course. I train my students at the start of the year to use these folders whenever they are missing a handout (for whatever reason). At the end of the period, any extra handouts go into the correct folder for that course and day of the week. If a student was away Monday and Tuesday that week, when they return to class they go to the organizer and pick up one of each handout in the Monday and Tuesday folders. When the next Monday rolls around, I transfer any handouts left in that folder to the folder with the corresponding unit name - that is where all the extras go. If a student needs to access handouts from earlier in the year (not just the last week) they can find them there. This method (and training the kids on using it) has saved me so much time and aggravation.

highschoolteachers,"I work at a fairly tough inner-city high school with deeply entrenched gangs. Violence is no stranger, and although fights are much less common than they were on campus in previous years, they still occur. When that happens the combatants will be sent home with their parents for the rest of the day and instructed to return the next day with parents for a conference. The reason to send then home on the day of the fight is to allow for a ""cool off"" period, so that a productive conversation can happen later. Of course, some acts are non-negotiable; these are criminal acts such as bringing a weapon to school, drug offenses, larceny, etc. For acts of this level we have two police officers stationed on our campus. When serious offenses are discovered, the offending student is usually arrested. Sometimes when they have completed whatever the justice system has is store for them we see them again. Very rarely they are expelled. Sometimes they end up at another school, often at the direction of the court. At any rate, the students were not suspended. What we found is that the vast majority of suspensions were for violations of the ""no defiance"" rule. Why, we reasoned, should ill-behaved children be rewarded with a day off for bad behavior? Once suspension for defiance was taken off the table (and this was largely due to our principal), our suspensions stopped.",work fairly tough inner city deeply entrenched gang violence stranger although fight much le common campus previous year still occur happens combatant sent home parent rest day instructed return next day parent conference reason send home day fight allow cool period productive conversation happen later course act non negotiable criminal act bringing weapon drug offense larceny etc act level two police officer stationed campus serious offense discovered offending student usually arrested sometimes completed whatever justice system store see rarely expelled sometimes end another often direction court rate student suspended found vast majority suspension violation defiance rule reasoned ill behaved child rewarded day bad behavior suspension defiance taken table largely due principal suspension stopped

If the kids do not feel like you care about them, they are not going to work for you. This does not mean getting involved in their personal lives. Stay as far away from their personal lives as possible. Since it is high school, they are not going to let you in too close to begin with, but as their teacher, you cannot get caught up in their tales of woe. Instead, show yourself. Show your personality. Talk about your life and the experiences you have had that allow you to relate to them. Where I taught was a highly populated gang area (bloods and crips, the whole deal). Kids like that value respect and honesty. Above anything else, talk to them like adults, respect their space, and respect their values.

highschoolteachers,"Whilst you are right that there is a vast disparity between the maths that is useful in a university maths course and the maths that is useful in other areas of life, I disagree that the school system (or hell, any school system in any of the five different countries I have had to look up the details of the education system (I work in a university with a lot of international students, tutoring first year students, so I need to know what I can assume as a starting point) is the latter. Frankly, there is a tiny, tiny fraction of the curriculum that is actually useful in the university maths setting. The vast majority of it (and in this, I include all of the US's calculus modules) will have to be retaught properly at some point, after we have fixed all of the other gaps up. So, rather than listening to the general rhetoric from people who do not work in universities about ""what universities want"", here is an answer from someone that actually has to teach the kids that high schools produce: We want people that can think. We could not care less if the students coming in have never heard of an integral (hell, that might even be an advantage, since we will not have to correct their misunderstandings). We want students that we can throw into unfamiliar problems and have them work through it intelligently. We do not want people that can mindlessly apply some ""correct method"" that they have memorised. We want people who can look at problems, think their way around them, think outside the box, try different approaches to it. It would help if they understood the concepts of proof, but it is far more important that they understand the method by which mathematics is actually done and how those proofs are actually produced (by lots of trial and error, lots of guess work, and lots of trying weird ideas, then paring them down to what everybody else does after the fact). Given a choice between a student who had ""learned"" (by which I here mean ""memorised"") the material on every high school maths module available and somebody who can give interesting insights into areas that they have never seen before, I will take the latter, every single time (and, as an aside: they do exist, they are not massively rare (I would say upwards of 25% of the general population are perfectly capable of doing this with minimal assistance in primary/elementary school), and in my experience, exposure to mathematics education in school tends to hamper it far more than it helps (by the time they go to university intending to do maths, that percentage above has dropped to something pretty close to zero, and we spend a huge amount of time and effort trying to fix it).",whilst right vast disparity math useful university math course math useful area life disagree system hell system five different country look detail education system work university lot international student tutoring first year student need know assume starting point latter frankly tiny tiny fraction curriculum actually useful university math setting vast majority include u calculus module taught properly point fixed gap rather listening general rhetoric people work university university want answer someone actually teach kid school produce want people think could care le student coming never heard integral hell might even advantage since correct misunderstanding want student throw unfamiliar problem work intelligently want people mindlessly apply correct method memorised want people look problem think way around think outside box try different approach would help understood concept proof far important understand method mathematics actually done proof actually produced lot trial error lot guess work lot trying weird idea paring everybody else fact given choice student learned mean memorised material every math module available somebody give interesting insight area never seen take latter every single time aside exist massively rare would say upwards general population perfectly capable minimal assistance primary experience exposure mathematics education tends hamper far help time go university intending math percentage dropped something pretty close zero spend huge amount time effort trying fix

highschoolteachers,"I am just starting my second year of teaching, which is high school, not elementary school, but here are some of my insights on the teaching profession in general: 1. Credential school in no way prepares you for standing in front of a classroom for the first time, totally alone and totally without backup. You will be able to design a hell of a good lesson plan, but all the classroom management techniques and tips you learn about in school go out the window once you have 60 eyes staring back at you. 2. The arts and crafts side of teaching, especially in elementary school, can be seductive and distract you from real prep. No matter how cute the lesson is or how pretty your bulletin board is, if you do not have the ability to back it up with teaching them skills or knowledge, you will not be successful. 3. You will try to like your admin, but your admin will fail you more often than not. If you have a good principal, stay there and rejoice, for they are few and far between. 4. You will be incredibly tired. You will hate your job. 5. You will be incredibly excited. You will love your job. 6. You will not be prepared for how much you bond with your kids, and how seeing one of them succeed will make you feel. 7. You will not understand how that perfectly crafted lesson, that followed all the rules and did all the right things, totally failed you. 8. You will not understand how the lesson you pulled from thin air in the car on the way to work won the day. 9. You will not learn about how the pressure for the kids to perform well on their tests translates to pressure and anxiety for you. You will be constantly questioning yourself: Did I teach them enough? Did I teach them the right things? Did I teach them at *all*? 10. You will not be prepared for the negativity and antipathy your colleagues exude. You will not be prepared for how many disservices your colleagues are doing to your students. You will be dismayed by school culture.

highschoolteachers,"I started my teaching career at 32, so you are certainly not ""too late"" to start. How it works depends on what you want to do. If you want to teach at the high school level, you will want at least a bachelors in the content area you want to teach (or at least a related field - i.e. a journalism degree would get you a position as an english teacher.) Not required, but desired and it will make you much more competitive. You also need to go through some kind of credential program which involves student teaching in order to be certified, as well as pass content area tests. To teach middle grades, you will still need a bachelors, but it is less stringent on what it is in - typically you can get away with a minor in your content area. Schools around where I am from often expect middle school teachers to be certified in more than one content area, though not always. (Usually either math/science or ela/social studies). I think with a BA in biblical studies, you likely have the skill set to become a good English teacher. Critical reading/analysis of texts are right up your alley.

highschoolteachers,"Current paraprofessional (aka para educator) here. You will most likely be asked a lot of questions that reveal your personality and ways you would resolve issues. Firstly, you need to realize that your educational background puts you ahead of the curve of many para educators. Some of my coworkers only have their high school degree. Do not let your degree make you too comfortable because many of my coworkers also are in the process of getting their M.Ed. Just make it clear you have an educational background that is tailored for this position. What you want to demonstrate during your interview is that your primary job is to work **with** the teacher to make the class as dynamic as possible. You are neither the type of person that is basically another warm body in the back of the room nor someone that is going to challenge the authority of the teacher. Your main objective is to assist the teacher so that you can make the class the best learning environment possible. No school wants to hire someone that is going to rock the boat and make the teacher's job more difficult. You want to be a team player. That being said, if you see students rights being violated (which I have in high school in the form of the accommodations in the IEP being ignored/the teacher outright refused) you need to bring it up with the teacher privately before or after school. If the teacher refuses to change, you need to go up the chain of command. If you sit idly by, you may face repercussions for turning a blind eye. You want to demonstrate that you are someone that has compassion, but is also able to be objective about situations when required. You know how to handle behavioral issues appropriately in a way that is consistent with class expectations, but you are also able to think of alternative ways to handle behavioral issues for students with developmental disorders. You should probably drop key words like positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, token economy, forward and backward chaining, etc. and know the meanings of those terms. Do not drop any lingo you are not positive about because that may be awkward if you are called out on it. You never want to use punishment to diffuse problem behavior. You will probably also be asked how you feel about assisting students with their bathroom needs. This may include changing diapers. I work in high school and occasionally have been asked to help with toileting situations/to change diapers. If you are uncomfortable with this/flat out refuse to do that, then you need to be honest. You may not get the job if you refuse to help with toileting, but you will also because a ton of issues and potentially may be let go if you refuse to deal with toileting issues but claim during the interview to be fine with it. Also, just remember to let your love for children shine through. Too many people lose their love for education and children. You want the interviewer(s) to realize you have a real passion for enhancing the lives of students and seeing them grow educationally.

highschoolteachers,"I taught 7th grade ELA one year after teaching mainly 11th grade Composition for multiple years. The biggest difference I noticed was that the middle schoolers had trouble not only handling what should be personal problems but also discerning when they were just that. For example, a high school student announcing to the class that s/he does not have a writing utensil is relatively rare. The rest of the kids would look at him/her like, ""What is your problem?"" In middle school, no one sees it as weird/abnormal to do that. A high school student who does not feel well and wants to go call home in the office would just say, ""May I have a pass to the office? I think I am feeling sick,"" while a middle schooler would detail for you how s/he had diarrhea after waking up and his/her stomach is churning right now and blah blah blah. If you are trying to hold a discussion around a piece of literature or topic, the high schoolers really only get unfocused on purpose to distract you if they are bored, whereas middle schoolers will politely raise their hands and share the most asinine thing (a family story or some other unrelated connection) but actually thought it would be helpful to the class to hear about it and are genuinely upset to see the exasperated expression on the teacher's face. I think by the end of the year, my most spoken phrase was, ""Sounds like a personal problem..."" The parents, especially when it is their first/oldest child, do nothing to help the situation because they also cannot discern between personal/private life and issues versus school/public concerns. I was inundated with emails detailing really insanely personal things (medical information irrelevant to the student's learning, sordid details from home, scandalous info about divorces, etc.) from the middle school parents, whereas only the freakish high school parents provide you with any of that info (in my experience, at least).",taught the grade ela one year teaching mainly the grade composition multiple year biggest difference noticed schoolers trouble handling personal problem also discerning example student announcing class writing utensil relatively rare rest kid would look like problem one see weird abnormal student feel well want go call home office would say may pas office think feeling sick schooler would detail diarrhea waking stomach churning right blah blah blah trying hold discussion around piece literature topic schoolers really get unfocused purpose distract bored whereas schoolers politely raise hand share asinine thing family story unrelated connection actually thought would helpful class hear genuinely upset see exasperated expression teacher face think end year spoken phrase sound like personal problem parent especially first oldest child nothing help situation also cannot discern personal private life issue versus public concern inundated email detailing really insanely personal thing medical information irrelevant student learning sordid detail home scandalous info divorce etc parent whereas freakish parent provide info experience least

highschoolteachers,"I taught high school inclusion classes with a co-teacher for 5 years. In my experience, there are generally three ""tiers"" of students receiving special needs services. Tier 1 - Students with IEPs who are in general classes. This would be the biggest group. Most students with disabilities can be successful in a general class, with the support of a co-teacher. They generally have learning disabilities like dyslexia or ADD/ADHD, autism, or mild cognitive disabilities (low IQ). They receive accommodations relating to their disability, like extra time on tests (and the different room can help cut the anxiety of testing students because of the smaller group), modified tests, or being allowed to type an essay for a standardized test instead of hand write it. My co-teacher would take students who receive accommodations into another room when they had a test or quiz, and she would read the test aloud to them as well as give them extra time. Not all students used their accommodations. Some did not generally need them, they were just legally there just in case. You could opt out of accommodations for any reason. Tier 2 - Students with IEPs who are in self contained academic classes for all or part of the day. These students have more of a severe disability that would keep them from being successful in a regular class. They might have a more severe cognitive disability or learning disability. But they can still learn academic content. The self contained English classes at my school were for students from grades 9-12 and mostly focused on paragraphing, spelling, basic reading comprehension, and basic grammar. Many of the kids in self-contained classes were on a general high school diploma track, but some were on track for a certificate of completion. Tier 3 - Students in the life skills program. These would be students with profound disabilities who do not take academic classes. Most students in a life skills class are unable to read or read at a very simple level. It depends on the kid's ability level, but the goal of a life skills program is to help the student live as independently as possible after he/she is finished with school (life skills kids attend graduation ceremonies, but they do not get a diploma; they are legally allowed to attend school until age 22). Some life skills students have jobs that they go to during the school day; at our school they worked at the CVS across the street, or they may have jobs that they do around the school, like cleaning the cafeteria. Unless you are a licensed special ed teacher, you would not be working with students in tiers 2 and 3. The students with disabilities in an inclusion class are not going to appear outwardly ""disabled"". But they are going to need extra help and support from you, for the most part. I had a few students with IEPs who excelled in my class, but more often than not, my inclusion students struggled significantly with English and math. Special education all depends on the student's ability level, which is why it is called an Individualized Education Plan. I am a huge believer in inclusion, and that most people with disabilities can succeed in the classroom. Sadly, inclusion does not always work out the way it is intended to - there are many horror stories of co-teachers not getting along or collaborating, or classes that are over 50% special ed (I have had them - it is supposed to be that no more than 1/3 of the class has an IEP). However, I have been fortunate to have had mostly good experiences. My students with IEPs are often the most diligent workers in the classroom as they have had to adapt to struggling for most of their academic career.",taught inclusion class co teacher year experience generally three tier student receiving special need service tier student reps general class would biggest group student disability successful general class support co teacher generally learning disability like dyslexia add adhd autism mild cognitive disability low iq receive accommodation relating disability like extra time test different room help cut anxiety testing student smaller group modified test allowed type essay standardized test instead hand write co teacher would take student receive accommodation another room test quiz would read test aloud well give extra time student used accommodation generally need legally case could opt accommodation reason tier student reps self contained academic class part day student severe disability would keep successful regular class might severe cognitive disability learning disability still learn academic content self contained english class student grade mostly focused paragraphing spelling basic reading comprehension basic grammar many kid self contained class general diploma track track certificate completion tier student life skill program would student profound disability take academic class student life skill class unable read read simple level depends kid ability level goal life skill program help student live independently possible finished life skill kid attend graduation ceremony get diploma legally allowed attend age life skill student job go day worked ca across street may job around like cleaning cafeteria unless licensed special ed teacher would working student tier student disability inclusion class going appear outwardly disabled going need extra help support part student reps excelled class often inclusion student struggled significantly english math special education depends student ability level called individualized education plan huge believer inclusion people disability succeed classroom sadly inclusion always work way intended many horror story co teacher getting along collaborating class special ed supposed class pep however fortunate mostly good experience student reps often diligent worker classroom adapt struggling academic career
highschoolteachers,"In my experience, MS teachers have more classes to prep for and often will be cored (math and science are usually together). In high school, I think you need a test to teach the higher level maths. In high school, you have a lot more demands for testing, including the ever powerful CAHSEE (exit exam). I ended up loving MS, even though I started in high school. I may go back to HS one day just to have fewer preps. I love MS because I can be goofy and we can have a lot of fun. In MS, the staff is smaller and the school is smaller, just because you have only 2-3 grades. It is easier to work together with others in PLCs. If you want to work in a smaller school and really get to know your students, then MS is the path for you. In HS, because there are more teachers, there is more stuff! There are clubs and dances and events that MS sometimes struggle to put on. There are school rallies and career events and electives.

highschoolteachers,"How is this ""cream of the crop"" group chosen? Do all kids have an equal chance to be part of it? Can a kid who had a rough start get into the group later? If all kids have a truly equal chance, I could see it being similar to the ""Student of the Week"" thing a lot of elementary classrooms have. You could even choose a kid one week who does struggle but made a significant gain in some way, even if he is not at the ""advanced"" level. If the group is relatively homogeneous and static, I absolutely understand your gut feeling. You do not want a ""good kids vs. bad kids"" mentality in your class. And you do not want the kid who tries but who has ADD or cannot do work at home to feel like he can never be successful.

I taught 8th grade general science for 3 years while simultaneously teaching high school biology and had to remind myself every fall that those the skills have to be overtly taught via repeated modeling over and over again. The only ways to know you have done it right is when they are automatically doing it or (even better) carrying those skills over to use in their other classrooms. I love the intellectual challenge of teaching upper level courses, but you are right that there is nothing better than the highs of teaching middle schoolers. They are not ashamed to hug. I only had to be enthusiastic, with wide eyes and a grin on my face when I told them we are going to have a good day today and they would be whole-heartedly in to whatever the lesson was.

highschoolteachers,"We have two forms of teacher/classroom arrangements in my board for gr 7-8. 1. Rotary teachers - specialised in a particular subject area and only teach that to several sections of the same grade. Much like traditional high school set ups. So you would teach many students the same subject all day. (I taught 420 students music last year) 2. Homeroom teacher - you teach all subjects to the same 25-30 kids. More like a traditional elementary set up. You might have one or two specialist teachers come in (ie. French, phys Ed) but otherwise you do it all. &gt; To me this does not directly imply a student requiring ""support"" to complete the work. Most that do something like this would be doing it because they forgot to complete the work or did not want to. I consider students struggling with responsibility and organisational skills that interfere with learning as needing ""support"". *Why are they forgetting their work?* Over scheduled? Do not know how to keep an agenda? Maybe having to care for younger siblings at home? *Why do not they want to complete the work even though they are capable?* Would they rather demonstrate learning in a different way? Is the work too easy and boring? It is important to me to understand why these things are happening. Even if it is unrelated to the concept we are learning.

As some have said already, the upper elementaries age are often not very good role models for the younger students. Also, I teach 6th graders and some of them are bigger than me. I had two students this year who were almost 6 feet tall and 200+ pounds. This could be avoided by keeping the grades separated, but some of those big 6th graders could really hurt a kindergartener or first grader if they are doing something they should not be doing, like running in the hallway, etc. The district I attended for school was originally set up like the one I currently teach in, but they have since switched to k-5 in elementaries, 6-8 in middles, and 9-12 in high schools, which I also think is an acceptable division because there is a noticeable difference between 5th and 6th grade in size and, to some extent, maturity. The 6th graders definitely act a lot like middle schoolers, although at the same time I think they do the best in a school with just 5th and 6th grade...keeps them a little more sheltered for an extra year.",teach the the grade intermediate district grade i school grade intermediate school grade grade said already upper elementaries age often good role model younger student also teach the grader bigger two student year almost foot tall pound could avoided keeping grade separated big the grader could really hurt kindergartener first grader something like running hallway etc district attended originally set like one currently teach since switched i elementaries middle school also think acceptable division noticeable difference the the grade size extent maturity the grader definitely act lot like schoolers although time think best the the grade keep little sheltered extra year
highschoolteachers,"I have taught 8th grade as well as high school. Going from High School to Middle School, expect the following: * More nagging/helicopter parents * Students will need much more redirection and cues to stay on task. Working in groups is much more successful, though, provided group work is more than ""Finish this worksheet together"" * You can reward them with candy. And it is great. High schoolers do not care about tangible rewards like this because they can just go buy it for themselves. * Students are generally easier to engage and encourage. There seems to be a certain point in the sophomore year that most kids assume that they will never change and accept the way they are. Middle schoolers are all still full of hope and optimism. * Planning and grading time is generally the same, though plan on doing more activities and projects. They are not ready for the daily grind of high school classes, so be sure to break the pace with fun, content-related activities. * Bullying is much more visible. I am not saying bullying disappears in high school (in fact, it likely becomes worse), but middle school students have not learned how to hide their bullying from teachers yet. The ""we were just playing around"" excuse will get said a lot. * Less standardized testing (in Ohio, anyways), but more focus on that one test. * If the students like you, they will draw pictures for you. Hang those suckers up! * Conference night will be much busier. * IEP/504 implementation is going to be much more scrutinized, too. I was constantly making adjusted tests for students in middle school. High school students will often try to avoid using their accommodations at all (except for extended time, they' abuse that to no end). * They do not really know what note taking is.

highschoolteachers,"I have taught science &amp; math in high school for 7 years, and I think the real issue is not that students are not capable of making judgments/being logical, it is more that they do not really care enough to *try*. They have spent ~10 years in a system that is based purely on knowing a single specific correct answer and anything that does not fit within their expectations simply is not worth their time. I used to think the problem was more concentrated with lower achieving students, but this past year showed me that honors students are just as guilty of the issue. So many students have a need to answer first that they do not spend any time actually engaging in the thought process. It does not help that the high stakes standardized tests they take in June encourage their mindset. The Regents Physics exam in NY for example, is primarily a test of vocabulary and basic algebra skills. If you know what variable represents a given quantity, can choose the appropriate formula, and correctly solve for the missing term, you will score very well on the exam (students are also given a list of all relevant terms and every necessary equation on a reference sheet while taking the exam). I have had students who would ace this exam fail to correctly answer very simple conceptual reasoning questions on the same content. Instead of asking ""How far does Billy travel if he is moving with a velocity of 10 m/s for 2 hours?"" you simply ask students to interpret/create graphs of Billy's motion, you get wildly different results. In the same vein, simply removing the options from a multiple choice question to make it a short answer question has a similar effect. If I have any concrete suggestions, I would try to make it the norm from Day 1 that you are more concerned with understanding than you are with trivia. Do not make reasoning skills a thing you touch on once and then forget about in favor of a style more aligned with standardized tests.

Now one can complain about ""kids need recess, they need electives, they need their sports"" but at some point an adult has to triage the situation and decide what is important. If the family does not want the student pulled out of anything then our hands are tied as teachers we have limited ability to re-do content when we are in the middle of teaching the continuing content. It somehow has to happen outside of class time or we just snowball the problem.",depends age level support administration missing recess classwork missing academic stuff significant discussion parent allow pulling student elective deal core academic level athletic eligibility risk basically hold student back practice missing content one complain kid need recess need elective need sport point adult triage situation decide important family want student pulled anything hand tied teacher limited ability content teaching continuing content somehow happen outside class time snowball problem

highschoolteachers,"I agree. By high school, not having technology at home places kids at a huge disadvantage when it comes to their peers. They have significant difficulty getting essays/research assignments/projects done on time when they only have class time to work on it. Sure, there is the public library, but having transportation as well as being able to actually use the technology there can make it even more difficult.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science, so I run the following ""Tragedy of the Commons"" activity to introduce the topic before teaching them about sustainability and the effects of overfishing in Canada: * I break up the class into small groups of 4 or 5 (depending on class size). Each group stands around a desk where I place a bowl. I tell them that the bowl represents a communal lake shared by the group. In each bowl I place a small number of M&amp;M candies to represent the fish. The number of candies I start with is usually 6 per student. So a group of 5 starts with 30 M&amp;Ms. * The kids are instructed to turn around so their backs are to the bowl. Each student in a group gets assigned a number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). When I call that number, the students assigned that number will turn around and will ""fish"" as many fish as they want out the bowl. None of the members of the group need to know how many M&amp;Ms the others take (and often eat). We do this for one round giving each kid a turn. The students then turn around to check how many fish are left in their bowl as I walk around and add more ""fish"" to their bowls. * The key is that the number of M&amp;Ms I add to each bowl depends on the number of ""fish"" each lake has left. I simply double the numbers left. * We go for four rounds like this. Once a group has emptied their lake of candy I will leave their bowl empty for the rest of the activity and they just get to quietly watch the other groups get more candy. At the end, the groups with fish left in their lakes get to keep the remaining candy in their bowl. I explain the activity to the class before we begin. What I do not tell them, however, is that they get to share the remaining candy at the end of the exercise or how many rounds (fishing seasons) we will go. They know before we start the activity that the best way to keep candy in their bowls is to keep as much candy as possible in the bowl at the end of each round. They often assume that they will only get to keep the candy they fish out of the lake each time they get a turn and, without knowing when the activity will end, the trick is to get as much candy as they can without depleting their resource. Almost every year there is at least one group in the class that empties their bowl on the first round. Usually most groups will empty their lake before the end of the activity. Once I had a group that, by agreement, ate no candies throughout the activity and ended up splitting almost 200 M&amp;Ms between four of them. The kids enjoy this activity and I can get some good discussions from them about sustainability and the ""Tragedy of the Commons"".",teach science run following tragedy common activity introduce topic teaching sustainability effect overfishing canada break class small group depending class size group stand around desk place bowl tell bowl represents communal lake shared group bowl place small number amp candy represent fish number candy start usually per student group start amp i kid instructed turn around back bowl student group get assigned number e i call number student assigned number turn around fish many fish want bowl none member group need know many amp i others take often eat one round giving kid turn student turn around check many fish left bowl walk around add fish bowl key number amp i add bowl depends number fish lake left simply double number left go four round like group emptied lake candy leave bowl empty rest activity get quietly watch group get candy end group fish left lake get keep remaining candy bowl explain activity class begin tell however get share remaining candy end exercise many round fishing season go know start activity best way keep candy bowl keep much candy possible bowl end round often assume get keep candy fish lake time get turn without knowing activity end trick get much candy without depleting resource almost every year least one group class empty bowl first round usually group empty lake end activity group agreement ate candy throughout activity ended splitting almost amp i four kid enjoy activity get good discussion sustainability tragedy common

highschoolteachers,"I think there is a huge disparity between math you need to go to college/university and math you need for adult life. I actually think this is where the school system failed me (personally). I, very weirdly, was better at beginner trigonometry than I was at a lot of the other math skills required to pass grade twelve math. In fact, I am pretty sure trig is the only reason I passed grade 12 math. Grade 12 math seemed to focus on getting us ready for the three OAC courses (grade 13); Algebra, Calculus, and Finite. We still had grade 13 at that point, and those courses were prerequisites for a variety of university/college programs. I did not take any of them. By the end of grade 12 I knew I was not going to be able to do university level math. I took Psychology (and English) and had to take statistics twice to pass it with a C. I did great in Research Methods though! Anyway, all that to say, since grade 12 I have never had to do any trigonometry, but I bet some people with different career paths have. I think I have stress-blocked the rest of it out of my mind because it was so traumatizing/embarrassing to have someone repeatedly help you with something and still not get it. If there had been a course about cooking conversions, measuring and scale, percentages, budgeting, smart shopping, banking, financial planning etc. I would have benefitted greatly. Instead, I learned the beginning of trigonometry. I am sure I learned the skills needed to do a variety of things mentioned above, but I likely did not connect the purpose behind what I was learning because I was so stressed about memorizing the formula I needed to get the right answer. So now when I need to do math that is over my head, I go on YouTube and watch a video that teaches exactly what I need to know. As a follow up question, would you expect a 45 year old math teacher who has not taken English since high school to be able to discuss Twelfth Night spontaneously because they read it in grade nine?",think huge disparity math need go college university math need adult life actually think system failed personally weirdly better beginner trigonometry lot math skill required pas grade twelve math fact pretty sure trig reason passed grade math grade math seemed focus getting u ready three oak course grade algebra calculus finite still grade point course prerequisite variety university college program take end grade knew going able university level math took psychology english take statistic twice pas i great research method though anyway say since grade never trigonometry bet people different career path think stress blocked rest mind traumatizing embarrassing someone repeatedly help something still get course cooking conversion measuring scale percentage budgeting smart shopping banking financial planning etc would benefitted greatly instead learned beginning trigonometry sure learned skill needed variety thing mentioned likely connect purpose behind learning stressed memorizing formula needed get right answer need math head go youtube watch video teach exactly need know follow question would expect year old math teacher taken english since able discus twelfth night spontaneously read grade nine

highschoolteachers,"&gt;Well, when you are in college and you have an exam, the professor does not care if you are deathly sick. Absolutely not true. Using the ""college professors are strict"" excuse to justify strict policies is a cop out. Elementary school teachers say the same about middle school teachers, middle school teachers say the same thing about high school teachers. There are college professors out there that would not budget even if your entire family died in a plane crash and there are professors out there that are complete pushovers. And everything in between. Really, any blanket statement about an entire class of people is a load of bull anyway. Do not use other people as an excuse to justify procedures. EDIT: Furthermore, linking a student's grade to their attendance (by making the makeup test harder, for example) dilutes the meaning of a grade. Grades should demonstrate only what a student knows, not whether or not they skip school.

highschoolteachers,"I completely agree! I would add to the belief that not only is college not for everyone but for a huge number of kids college should not be entered into immediately following high school. I teach at a private school in a large city that loves to tout 100% college acceptance rate. The college counsellors insist students apply to a minimum of 8 schools. These kids are told that not only will you go to college you will go to a top tier college. At graduation they announce where the student is going to college as they walk across stage to receive your diploma! It was a huge deal last year when a student said they were going to take a gap year before attending college. I have so many students who have been pushed so hard for so long they do not realize there are other options out there. I realize I teach at an independent school and it is a different demographic than public education. But I think it is even harder for these kids to say they do not want to go to college now or ever. They do not even know it is an option for them to not go to college yet still be successful in life. When I talk to my students about this they look at me like I am crazy; I am the first adult that has ever said them, ""college is a choice and it is not for everyone. You can still be intelligent and not go to the best school, wait a few years to go, or not go at all."" This has turned into a ramble but I am just so tired of being surrounded by colleagues, administrators, and parents that only see one path to (or definition of) success that they deny the existence and merit of other options to the point where the kids do not even know there is any other way to be a happy and productive adult.

highschoolteachers,"Happened to me in high school. I went to a private school. A kid stole my journal out of my locker, photocopied it, and sold the photocopies to kids around the school. We could have had him arrested for theft. The school assured us he would be punished. Instead, I got a day of suspension for the content of my journal (I bought a book to school that was not academic in nature, so I got a day of in-school suspension). I was then grounded for a month because of the suspension. The kids' grandparents bribed the administration to let them off the hook. Despite a confession from the kids who did this to me, the school did not suspend them and told my parents there was no evidence to convict them, thus we should not press charges. Guess who is now sitting in jail? Not me. Guess who learned to never put your kid in a system so open to bribery?

highschoolteachers,"I think it is important to dress professionally in a high school setting.

I am also a new teacher so I believe it also shows that I am professional and take my job seriously. With that being said, I love a good casual Friday.

highschoolteachers,"Mm, yeah, no. Our school has the equivalent to a scorched Earth policy about cellphones - no cellphone to be seen at any time during class, instant detention if it is - and it has had a very positive impact on focus in the classroom. We have tried the integrated cellphone use, and it just gets abused way too much to be worth it. As it stands, making cellphones universally banned in classrooms is clear, obvious, and (if you have half a brain cell) easy to follow. I really resent the idea that teachers just need to accept this constant disrespectful distraction as a part of life: firstly, cellphones were a well established thing when I was in high school not that long ago, so it is not me being ""out of touch"" that makes me not want to see phones in class. Secondly, conversation is far more ubiquitous than cellphones even, but we do not go around arguing that teachers should just accept being talked over all the time as part of normal classroom culture. ""Have you ever tried reframing this distraction as a positive so that you can accept it?"" is beyond insulting to people whose profession it is to understand the best environments for learning.",my yeah equivalent scorched earth policy cellphone cellphone seen time class instant detention positive impact focus classroom tried integrated cellphone use get abused way much worth stand making cellphone universally banned classroom clear obvious half brain cell easy follow really resent idea teacher need accept constant disrespectful distraction part life firstly cellphone well established thing long ago touch make want see phone class secondly conversation far ubiquitous cellphone even go around arguing teacher accept talked time part normal classroom culture ever tried reframing distraction positive accept beyond insulting people whose profession understand best environment learning

highschoolteachers,"Here Is what I would tell any parent looking to accelerate their child a year in school. I did it for my own daughter, and bitterly regretted it. She skipped second grade and went straight into third grade. When a kid skips a grade, its going to go exactly how you think its going to go - at first. There may be a few adjustments in the beginning, but within about a month, the child will be doing great. In fact, he or she will probably be close to the top of the next grade level, too. But here is what you have done... You traded away one of your childs kid years for an adult year. That Is one whole year earlier that they are going to move out of the house and be away from you. Having a 17 year old go off to college feels super fast. A 16 year old? Even faster. And what about that 16 year old in college. If its your daughter, do you think she is emotionally ready to have a 22 year old man hit on her around campus? Better yet, when she is 13, how about an 18 year old senior who pays her a lot of attention? Have you seen the movie Thirteen? Now do that to a kid who is a year younger. If its your son, who will he have the confidence to ask out on a date when hes 13 in high school or 16 in college? It can be really, really tough. The social adjustments necessary to go from second to third grade are really nothing compared to what they are going to be heading into high school and then college. My daughter was 100% ready to go skip second grade when I made that choice for her. When she started eighth grade, it was obvious - she was intellectually ready for the challenge, but not emotionally ready for it. Luckily, we moved school districts after she had been in 8th grade for a month. I found a sympathetic admin who allowed me to hold her back and make her repeat 7th grade. Man was she upset with me. The only way we got away with it is that she had moved away from her previous friends and school. She aced the 7th grade of course. Twice. But I absolutely do not regret getting back one of those kid years. Now that she is in college, she does not regret it either. She got to be a totally normal kid in high school. Dating, hanging out with friends, driving in her junior year... just like everyone else. If any parent is considering jumping their kid up a grade, I would tell them about my experience and encourage them to reconsider. There is plenty of time to become an adult. Skipping second or third grade is not going to help a kid one bit in the future, but it might just hurt a lot.",would tell parent looking accelerate child year daughter bitterly regretted skipped second grade went straight third grade kid skip grade going go exactly think going go first may adjustment beginning within month child great fact probably close top next grade level done traded away one child kid year adult year one whole year earlier going move house away year old go college feel super fast year old even faster year old college daughter think emotionally ready year old man hit around campus better yet year old senior pay lot attention seen movie thirteen kid year younger son confidence ask date he college really really tough social adjustment necessary go second third grade really nothing compared going heading college daughter ready go skip second grade made choice started eighth grade obvious intellectually ready challenge emotionally ready luckily moved district the grade month found sympathetic admin allowed hold back make repeat the grade man upset way got away moved away previous friend aced the grade course twice absolutely regret getting back one kid year college regret either got totally normal kid dating hanging friend driving junior year like everyone else parent considering jumping kid grade would tell experience encourage reconsider plenty time become adult skipping second third grade going help kid one bit future might hurt lot

highschoolteachers,"If I were the kid's mom, I would have him post an apology/clarification on Facebook. Even though your girlfriend would not technically see it, his friends would. It should include key phrases such as, ""By allowing my friends to act rudely and crass toward someone I admire and appreciate, and joined in myself, I embarrassed myself and my family. It is inappropriate and unbecoming of a gentleman to speak about anyone like that, let alone a teacher and mentor."" But that is my kid. Your girlfriend did absolutely nothing wrong, and she should not try to hide it. She does not need to volunteer it, but if she is asked if she has ever had any issues with students, she can bring it up and disclose how she, the boy's parents, and the boy handled it, which was very well. If she is still in contact with the boy, it is important that she imparts on him that speaking of her like that was a betrayal of friendship and confidence, and that she thought he was a better person than that. Teen boys are something, man. A lot of times they do not have the confidence in themselves not to fall into the disrespect-of-women trope, and sometimes they do not know any other way. I remember when I was in high school, I was the only girl on a drumline full of boys. They talked horribly about girls. Once I became an upperclassman and captain of the drumline, I felt more comfortable speaking out. During one rehearsal, the band parks and blows (stands still and plays) while the dance team dances right in front of the drumline. A couple of the guys were making crude jokes about the girls on the dance team, so I said, ""Excuse me!"" to get a couple of the girls' attention. When they turned around, I told my guys to repeat what they had just said. They turned red, and hemmed and hawed while I continued ordering them to repeat what they said. They finally did, and I looked at the girls and asked, ""Would you date a guy who talked to you like that?"" They all said no. It drove the message home, and I noticed a change in how they spoke about women. Most of them are starting to get married and while I was reminiscing with one who is having his first child soon, he jokingly mentioned that I could be pretty scary in high school, ""Especially when you called us on our bullshit, like with how we talked about girls.""

highschoolteachers,"Hey fellow male teacher. I taught high school for five years and currently work at a university. I started teaching at 23. Here is some *fashion* tips. If you are teaching in a high school at 21, realize that you are **EXTREMELY** close in age to your students. What you can do to differentiate yourself is dress. Here is/was my go-to attire for teaching: Start from the bottom: **Shoes**: Get some nice loafer-style or with laces. I went with black, light brown, tan, and a dark reddish brown that can be worn with black pants or brown pants. Do not buy dress shoes, buy the ""sneaker"" style of dress shoes, something with padding, with a little bit of give. You want something with a decent amount of sole, you will be on your feet a lot and walking around. Make sure they do not rub the back of your heel, either. **Socks**: Do not get traditional dress socks. You will be on your feet a lot (again) and you want something comfortable. For black shoes, I purchased some black athletic socks (they look the exact same as black dress socks, cost much less, and provide infinite amount of comfort. Get some green, tan, grey, red socks that are comfortable. They make good conversation starters with students when your socks match your tie or shirt. **Pants** Get you some Khaki's. Nice pairs. Colors are important. I had two pairs of brown in different shades. 1 khaki, 1 navy. Pick up two nice pairs or slacks (not khakis, occasionally you do need to step it up). Get one black and one brown. **Belts** Get at least two belts, one black and one brown. Wear your brown belt with brown shoes, your black belt with black shoes. **Shirts** It is okay to have some polos, but you do not want to wear those until your students know you are serious. Get some nice long-sleeve collared shirts. I suggest some basic solid colors. You should always have a white shirt, that is a given. Get some plaids and anything that interests you. As you teach, you will pick up school based t-shirts. These are perfectly fine to wear on appropriate days (pep rallies, etc.) **Shirts** (cont'd) - Never wear your collared long-sleeved shirts without something under it. I suggest picking up some white Hanes undershirts or something along those lines. **Ties** You do not need to wear a tie every day you teach, but it definitely helps to set you apart at first. I suggest a couple of solid color ties, something with stripes, and then have some fun. Kids like to connect. Bust out your superhero tie or your adventure time tie every now and then and the students will love it. Learn to tie a tie quickly and when you are not wearing it (you will be helping students tie them for prom, dressing up before games, etc). **Jewelry**: As a man, jewelry can be a bit odd in the classroom. If you have piercings and your school district does not care, keep wearing them. Nothing overly audacious, most school districts are anti-gauges for anyone. Realize, however, that you may alienate some students and you may have some students love you for the style and type of piercings you wear. *Watches* are great. I have a nice watch for ""dress-up"" days and then I have a wear any day watch. Deuce brand makes slim watches that you do not have to worry about banging on doors or something - http://www.deucebrand.com/collections/the-original. *Rings* are cool, just realize they are conversation pieces and something innocuous to you might spark a long conversation.

highschoolteachers,"I have been coaching dance team at the high school level for nearly four years. I had a similar experience during my second year with a very new program. I had a parent who was a very competitive dance mom from a **big** dance team community. Because our program was so new, not many kids had experience, and her daughter was the strongest dancer on the team. This fact led to a lot of entitlement on the dancer's part. The head coach became too close (friendly) with the mom and consequentially, the daughter got away with a lot of stuff (example: she was still able to keep her captain title after being caught bringing alcohol to a team event). She became really insubordinate to assistant coaches (me) and so I had to address the issue after a practice. Well, apparently, having to talk with the dancer about her disrespect caused her to think about killing herself. The mom took us coaches aside and reamed us AFTER A COMPETITION, in front of other dance teams/parents/coaches, and after we had just won two 2nd place trophies. It was awful. I chalked up this blow up to the fact that the other assistant and I were wanting to do the right thing by reporting the alcohol incident to the athletic director, and I am assuming the head coach told this to the mother. She made the rest of that *year a living hell. I finished the year out, but decided I was done with that program and its toxic environment. I found a better program that pays SO much better and has harder working kids, more appreciative parents, and people who admire and respect what I do. I could not be happier.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; but surely spending some time disconnected from this borg collective of texts and memes Do you not realize sir, resistance is futile. I am currently taking a course on developmental/educational pyschology that my program requires. One of the questions we actually just discussed was whether or not the technology of computers, the internet, and the mass network of interconnected technology has actually changed the way people's brains work. Do they remember less (because they think they can look anything up)? Have people's attention spans changed (to the point where they check websites obsessively or phones for notifications)? In one way cell phones are very similar to passing notes or bringing in a toy to the classroom, but at the same time they are changing the way we respond and expect things to happen. Instant results and gratification are more expected because of what technology allows us to do. Personally I am on the fence about whether computers and phones are useful or not in the classroom but the fact of the matter is more and more school districts are getting computers for students to use in the classroom at the high school and I would not be surprised if eventually that even moved to middle school too. It means dealing with these temptations and teaching how to use them as tools because they are there and cannot be ignored.",it surely spending time disconnected borg collective text meme realize sir resistance futile currently taking course developmental educational psychology program requires one question actually discussed whether technology computer internet mass network interconnected technology actually changed way people brain work remember le think look anything people attention span changed point check website obsessively phone notification one way cell phone similar passing note bringing toy classroom time changing way respond expect thing happen instant result gratification expected technology allows u personally fence whether computer phone useful classroom fact matter district getting computer student use classroom would surprised eventually even moved mean dealing temptation teaching use tool cannot ignored

highschoolteachers,"I was hired at my last two jobs because I got my foot in the door as a coach, so I advise all new teachers to get involved somewhere to prove their value and how well they work with kids. However, in my experience, there are actually very few people who are hired strictly because they are a coach unless they are brought in as a head varsity coach. Schools usually find a job in district for them otherwise it would be nearly impossible for a school to get any coaching candidates from outside the district. Non-coaching teachers often complain to me about this, but for a very large percentage of our kids, extracurricular activities are the best part of their high school experience. Also, I think many of these kids learn as many life skills through these activities as they do in the classroom so I will never discount their importance. It sounds to me like you have just had bad luck because you are interviewing in places that need coaches. If you want a job at those places, you are going to have to figure out a way that you can be valuable outside of the classroom.

I have had them in my classrooms since I was in high school, and student taught with them last semester and this semester. It is amazing being able to call a student up and have them put their math problem under the camera and we all discuss it together as a class... or when we are reading a text as a class, I can put my text under the document camera and students follow along. Honestly, it is because I never lived without these tools, so I do not know how to teach without them, but I would find teaching without a document camera to be very boring and difficult.

They were not cold about it, and when students broke down the teacher was there to support them/find the professional support available, but it gave us a purpose.

Of course, I still had behavioral problems, but they were different too. It was not the 'out of control' feeling that I had in the states. I think student teaching is hard for a number of reasons...the students know you are not a real teacher yet, so you have like 'sub' status, you are not there the first day of class to see all of the rules and procedures be put in place, your space is not really your own, etc. However I do know that some student teaching stuff was easier because my teacher took over more (putting in grades in the gradebook, etc.). But when you are student teaching the students might miss their old teacher and that was hard for me. They were used to one way of doing things and I can understand that anxiety of that being switched up! I never had student teachers in high school but I honestly do not think I would have liked them because I liked routine and stability. So I can understand the pushback that I got.

highschoolteachers,"First of all, being young usually does not help with classroom management as a high school teacher; at least it did not for me. My students viewed me as a peer, and in a way, I did too. I was very concerned about their perceptions of me, and this interfered with my classroom management. I did not want to confront them because I wanted them to like me. Probably somewhere around my 4th year of teaching, I got over it. I suppose experience helped, but I slowly came to the realization that it was not my job to be their friend; it was my job to be their teacher. Yes, I can be friendly and goof around with them, but I need to view myself as being a mentor more so than a buddy. I also had to get over the confrontation issue. My advice is to fake til you make it. I forced myself to be assertive and not let things slide. Of course I pick my battles, but through your effort in building relationships with students, you will know when it is okay to call a kid out in front of the class or when you need to address the matter quietly. After a while it becomes intuition. As far as keeping your head above water, you have to come up with a routine. I utilize every minute of planning and down time while I am at school. Whatever I do not finish goes home with me on the weekend, and I work on Sunday afternoons to get caught up. My family time is way too important to get bogged down with grading essays on a Tuesday night.

highschoolteachers,"Hi there and thanks so much for responding! What in your opinion made those first years so difficult? For me, student teaching was really tough because of behavior management but also because of curriculum. There are not a lot of really good Spanish resources out there (not that I can find anyway!). With the new proficiency guidelines, a lot of the stuff that I could find like fill in the blank grammar worksheets were not going to cut it. I felt like I was constantly having to re-invent the wheel and I am still not too gung-ho about IPAs and the focus on authentic resources because it kind of leads you to reinventing the wheel. I felt like I could never get ahead with making materials, and they probably were not very well-tailored because it is hard to make longer-term curriculum using authentic resources I AM GOING TO. You have to really analyze authentic resources and scaffold the hell out of them for students to get them! I have also realized how important rules and procedures are, and how there should be a procedure for everything : sharpening pencils, turning in papers, asking to go to the bathroom! I thought that high school students were mature enough to kind of just do their work but now I realize that they really need those rules, procedures and routines to feel safe and stay on task. I think one of the most frustrating things about student teaching was instructionally, I felt like I learned nothing about teaching Spanish. My CT was a sweetheart but very set on the grammar-translation method and shot down TPR when I tried it. I also did not have a projector and my teacher did not really understand the need for one, so staying in the target language was really difficult. I got push back from different levels: the upper students got really freaked out by hearing Spanish and some of them had just 'checked out' and saw Spanish as a blow-off class. So I think some of them resented it. Some of the lower level students kept asking me why they had to translate all the time and they got frustrated, but my CT did not want me to change her plans. Anyway, it is great to hear that you love your job most days and that you feel that you are getting into a groove :-) After student teaching, I was ready to jump into another field (speech pathology) but I realize that field has problems too and I might actually like teaching if I give it another go....",hi thanks much responding opinion made first year difficult student teaching really tough behavior management also curriculum lot really good spanish resource find anyway new proficiency guideline lot stuff could find like fill blank grammar worksheet going cut felt like constantly invent wheel still gung ho pas focus authentic resource kind lead reinventing wheel felt like could never get ahead making material probably well tailored hard make longer term curriculum using authentic resource going really analyze authentic resource scaffold hell student get also realized important rule procedure procedure everything sharpening pencil turning paper asking go bathroom thought student mature enough kind work realize really need rule procedure routine feel safe stay task think one frustrating thing student teaching instructional felt like learned nothing teaching spanish it sweetheart set grammar translation method shot tar tried also projector teacher really understand need one staying target language really difficult got push back different level upper student got really freaked hearing spanish checked saw spanish blow class think resented lower level student kept asking translate time got frustrated it want change plan anyway great hear love job day feel getting groove student teaching ready jump another field speech pathology realize field problem might actually like teaching give another go

Just a few supplements, like borrowing a cup of sugar from your neighbor. * On the rare occasions where I have both the time, money, and motivation: I will pick a dish that I would love to sit all weekend eating, then put together a complete shopping list based on that dish. * There is also the ""responsible adult"" thing to do: only buy things that are on sale, and create a menu based on those things while at the market. If I was given free reign, I would create my shopping list by picking the lab exercises that I would love to do.

Once I realized this, I changed my daily mantra. Instead of berating them for being rude or just getting angry, I started to explain to them that me standing at the board is an indication to put away the phone (and earphones).

highschoolteachers,"I would love to give my insight. How has your experience been? I feel high school is a much different experience of teaching in South Korea as compared to elementary. **For background:** in New York I taught in the inner-city of Buffalo (the 4th poorest city in the state). In Korea, I teach in the farm villages of Jeju Island (some of the poorest areas of the island). I am teaching the same grades of high school as I did in New York. - There are many similarities between the classrooms and education system. In both situations my students were tired, unmotivated, and disconnected. Luckily, I only worried about violence in my classroom while I worked in New York. Students from both locations are dealing with the effects of standardized testing and I can see the damage it is causing. - I left New York because I felt undervalued, as a history teacher I felt that I was not able to enhance my student's current lives, and I wanted to be in an environment where education was more respected. In Korea I definitely feel more valued and education is more respected but as an English teacher I am not enhancing the Korean student's lives. Since most of these students will not attend university they do not need to learn English; it is difficult trying to make a connection to why the material is important. This was the exact problem I faced in New York. - The reason I am choosing to stay in Korea rather than go back to New York revolves around my daily life. My class is ungraded and I have zero administrative duties - I went from working 60 hours a week with lesson planning and grading to working 40 hours a week with no time outside of school dedicated to the job. I have my Masters in education so it opens a lot of doors. I plan to continue teaching English outside of the United States for as long as I can.

I just ask them to take out their hotdog, and the question's already on the board when they come in. At the end of the six trivia days, I take 5 questions and make a quiz. If they get 5/5, their name goes into a draw for a small prize. Our group of six trivia questions usually have a theme; sometimes it is directly connected to our content, and sometimes it is just a cool, off-topic thing we have discussed in class.

highschoolteachers,"I assume you are not teaching so that high school kids can skip a semester of college science or so they can pad their GPAs. I assume you are teaching science because you want to teach and you love science -- neither of those things have anything to do with the AP exams. If you are judging your ability as a teacher by how much your kids care about a test, you are selling yourself short. The least of your concerns should be how much they care about the AP exam. They still learned from you, even if they did not take the test at all. Plus, they are teenagers. They do not have fully developed frontal cortexes -- the part of the brain responsible for complex decision making and consequential thinking literally has not finished growing yet.

highschoolteachers,"It seems to me that if you know this early that you want to teach, some good advice might be to figure out a way to get yourself a better-than-average deal. Either by being able to teach a relatively harder subject (or multiple subjects) or being able to coach a sports team as well or have a degree that makes you stand out or whatever. I have worked in underserved schools for a while so I am not saying that everyone should just flock to where the money is, but teaching at a relatively cushier, prestigious private school might for some be a better long term program than hacking away at the public school system or low-budget catholic schools or something. I know it sounds obvious as shit, but just figure out a way to be more valuable than your average Ed Major, Teaching Credential ""Teacher"" and you will be treated as such. If you are a senior in high school, then you have tons of time to prepare. You could search job postings for teachers and see the types of people that schools are looking to hire and then base your undergrad and grad path around that.",seems know early want teach good advice might figure way get better average deal either able teach relatively harder subject multiple subject able coach sport team well degree make stand whatever worked underserved school saying everyone flock money teaching relatively cashier prestigious private might better long term program hacking away public system low budget catholic school something know sound obvious shit figure way valuable average ed major teaching credential teacher treated senior ton time prepare could search job posting teacher see type people school looking hire base undergrad grad path around

You would be currently finishing up your freshman/9th grade year.

highschoolteachers,"Downsides: it requires tremendous amounts of energy, patience, and time. A sixteen-hour day is always going to be hard, but when six-seven of those hours is an intensive interaction with 30+ (or 40+) adolescents, it is a different level of sixteen-hour day. Maintaining your energy and some semblance of balance in your life is the great challenge, particularly in your first few years. Depending on your school you may have no support from home or helicopter parents; an administration that does not support you or attempts to micromanage your room; a group of cliquish colleagues who create as much drama as a pack of sixth-grade girls; violence in the halls, on the blacktop, and even in the classrooms; a school culture that promotes a cult-like status for the end-of-the-year standardized tests, etc. Again, that depends entirely on the site. You may find a combination of many of those; however, you could get lucky and face few, if any, of those elements. The benefits: aside from all of the above things, if you find this is the profession for you and you begin to thrive, it is a great career. If you truly like working with kids then it will be a great experience. If you are passionate about your subject then (almost) every lesson and unit will be interesting to teach, especially if you have a lot of autonomy at your site. In fifteen years, I have taught some lessons many, many times. I find ways to make them interesting and a little bit different from year to year. I find that history is a fascinating subject to teach and I have not grown tired of it yet. In most places you will be a social studies teacher so you will also be teaching a variety of other courses (at least at the high school level) throughout your career: geography, government, economics, sociology, psychology, etc. And from year-to-year the specific history class you teach could change. Oh, and those sixteen-hour days will disappear over time as you gain experience and have planned your year. I would recommend volunteering in classrooms when you can to get a feel for what things are like. This will also allow you to network a little with teachers and find out what things are like from their perspective.

The first thing I would suggest doing is that you should volunteer at schools. Observe and aid. Elementary, middle, and high school are all different beasts, and you will not know where you truly fit until you have been in the thick of it. Second, if you just like history, please do not teach.

Negatives: work place drama can get a little overwhelming if you let it get to you. Teachers tend to be bigger gossipers and babies than the students.

Even if you are unsure of how to answer a question, stay confident and try your best. To me differentiation meant finding a way to teach all learners. No matter the level, how will you reach that student. I had a 5th grader who needed help in phonics. I have also had 5th graders read at a high school level. What do you do to help all of them? How will you pull your strugglers up and push your advanced students further? Do not forget about accessing school and community resources. Perhaps they have a mentoring program available, or access to tutors or hourly teachers. Most teachers reach out to others to meet the needs of their students. You cannot do it all on your own and they may be impressed that you are knowledgeable about those that can help. Classroom management is also a huge concern that you may want to highlight.

There are people who could come right out of high school and be a teacher. We often hear a 4-year degree in education is a waste of time and money, and I believe in that too. My ""higher education"" started when I was in the classroom. I think education should become a 2-year apprentice style program with a Master Teacher showing the way. To your sister, I would say, ""Go for it then. Become a teacher. Replace the teacher you wish your son/daughter had. Be the change you want to see in the world."" On another note, I teach my kids, ages 8 and 11 more in the summer than they learn in 9 months of the classroom. I use Khan Academy and work only 1 hour a day with 1 to 1 individualized attention with me. They are both reading and doing high school math. So their teacher has not done as much for them as I have.

highschoolteachers,"I would not trust someone to be a teacher if they ""let something happen"". It really is not that difficult to just say ""no"" to a student who *you* are the authority over. You are *in locus parenti* over a student, not a potential date. I understand that some high school girls and boys are hot, and some smarter and more mature than others, but you are a substitute parent to these people. By getting involved with them you are hurting them and hurting your career. They do not need you to be their boyfriend or their lover, they need you to be their teacher. They especially do not need a teacher who is willing to throw their career and professionalism away over a little bit of sex with a student. If this guy wants to meet women he can join a club or go to a bar. An extra problem, for me, is that the authority of teaching tends to give you kind of an attractiveness bonus: it can boost your self-confidence and make you feel ""popular"" or ""cool"" if all these 16-18 year olds are looking at you. It is partly for that reason why this is entirely dangerous to flirt with a student: it is not a normal relationship at all to have power over someone while also trying to have sex with them. It is coercive and very weird. Personally, when I first started student teaching I was young and naiive and struggled with my attraction towards some of my students. After looking at myself honestly and who I wanted to be, I trained myself to see my female students as younger sisters or nieces: someone who I am charged to take care of. If I am distracted by their bodies it really ruins the whole dynamic of trying to get them to develop ethics and critical thinking. In the end, if you are still attracted, keep your fantasies to yourself and work it out in the bathroom when you get home! Let fantasy be fantasy and let reality be reality. I think we can both understand why your friend did what he did, but I hope that you also realize it was irresponsible and actually quite coercive and predatory, and that, as a teacher, he should *never* be a passive entity in *anything*.

Also, I refuse to pull my hair out grading old assignments the last few weeks of school because the student suddenly realized their obligations.

Students are challenging, by highly rewarding when they are interested and engaged. Relationships key. High. Hard subject material, hard to start learning without background knowledge.

Obviously you would select for the toddlers until they are old enough, but it will be a nice tradition that you can carry on.

What if we keep giving people a passing grade to encourage them, when actually the work is subpar of the average -needed- skill level, do we not just produce lesser capable people who have the same identification mark as those who are capable? It will be hard to differentiate later just by paper, who is better suited for task X because everyone is judged without relationship to each other. E.g a B for John is then not the same as a B for Patrick, but you cannot see from this data, who is a real B and who is really an F but we wanted to encourage them. What if these people then go do important jobs, based on their perceived idea of what they know, maybe a job where they can risk the safety of others? Is this not a problem?

Your new goal would be 20 + sqrroot(300-3(20)) = 20 + 15.49 = 35.49. Let us say you the next unit you meet this goal and get a 36%. Your new goal will be to get a 49.85.

highschoolteachers,"It is tough. There is a lot of ""homegrown"" talent you will be competing against for the rare slot that does open up. Your best bet, if you want to call it that, is to look at the struggling districts and title 1 schools. My experience has been that they like to hire outside of their current employees with the idea that they will bring in new ideas to turn things around. It is probably the most stress-inducing, meat-grinder of a job, however, and you should plan on keeping on the move the first decade or so in order to not get tagged with failing school status. Teaching experience is generally good, but not essential apparently. I still cannot wrap my head around this, but principals do get hired despite having never taught. Note that these principals are often resented by their staff. You *should* be ok with your six years, although I prefer 10 before I start considering somebody seasoned enough to lead myself. You will probably want to put some thought into teaching either elementary or high school. If all of your years are at the middle school level, theoretically that only leaves middle school positions for which you would be seriously considered. Again, this is not in stone, but it is come up. As far as targeting private/charter schools, it is hard to say. They have also got an astonishing churn rate. I know generally it is hard to keep teachers in there for more than a couple of years before moving on and I have heard the leadership turnover is pretty high as well. It is probably the same issue as title 1 public schools - nobody wants to be the one to go down with the ship so they put in there couple of years and move on. STEM is currently in vogue and you may be able to use that to your advantage. I am not certain if this is nationwide, but my state has regional ""Math/Science"" centers that are meant to direct and guide STEM curriculum. Sounds kind of hokey but they are actually pretty big deals - again I am not sure if it is universal, but ours at least serves a half dozen school districts and then serves as sort of a career center for students who want to attend a portion of the day in order to focus on more serious science/math classes. They tend to have a lot of oddball administrative-ish jobs like coaching, curriculum development, and of course running the center itself. Your background would serve you very well in this regard. You could also investigate outdoor learning centers/camps. Just be aware you are not going to get paid anything remotely decent unless you pull the director position down.",tough lot homegrown talent competing rare slot open best bet want call look struggling district title school experience like hire outside current employee idea bring new idea turn thing around probably stress inducing meat grinder job however plan keeping move first decade order get tagged failing status teaching experience generally good essential apparently still cannot wrap head around principal get hired despite never taught note principal often resented staff ok six year although prefer start considering somebody seasoned enough lead probably want put thought teaching either year level theoretically leaf position would seriously considered stone come far targeting private charter school hard say also got astonishing churn rate know generally hard keep teacher couple year moving heard leadership turnover pretty well probably issue title public school nobody want one go ship put couple year move stem currently vogue may able use advantage certain nationwide state regional math science center meant direct guide stem curriculum sound kind hokey actually pretty big deal sure universal least serf half dozen district serf sort career center student want attend portion day order focus serious science math class tend lot oddball administrative ish job like coaching curriculum development course running center background would serve well regard could also investigate outdoor learning center camp aware going get paid anything remotely decent unless pull director position

They do not need your approval so much, but they respect that you know what they need to learn because their next step is high school. Treat them like the young adults they are. Give them some freedom within the classroom. Be firm and fair...and have a sense of humor...and now they will do their best...not for you...but because you taught them it is for THEM. * 9th Grade: Little fish in a big pond.

They sort of lag sometimes because people think they should be more mature than they are. Give them encouragement and they will try their hardest. * 10 Grade: Growing up. You are there to teach them. They do not really need your approval or you to be much of a part of their day. Your job is to share the knowledge they need to get to the next step on their journey toward college or career.

I was thoroughly embarrassed, mainly because I did not mean any harm by the pic, but that I also go caught.

highschoolteachers,"It is sad. I am not a teacher, but stuff like that (in my opinion) is the reason why kids get a bad education sometimes (or a deteriorating one, in any case).

I know when I was in high school, it definitely happened (at my school anyway). I think the world would be improved significantly if kids were flunked when they write a shitty essay or fail a test. And no manner or complaining should be able to do anything to change it. Outside of legitimate bias toward particular students or legitimate unfair practices in the classroom I do not think there should *ever* be a reason to side with a student or parent over a grade.

highschoolteachers,"I think I can she would a little light on this subject...I currently homeschool my kids. We always hear the 'socialization' question regarding homeschooling, but let me let you in on something. No one actually wants to sit at home with our kids all day not interacting with anyone. No. One. I literally have NEVER met a homeschooling parent who does not want to socialize with other parents and let their kids interact with other kids. The most common ways most homeschooling families socialize are: 1. Church (for religious homeschoolers). I know some people who are at church with their kids almost every single day at some time of the day. Youth group, bible study, sunday services, wednesday services, choir practice, etc. 2. Homeschool groups. Everyone I know is a member of at least 1 homeschool group. Our homeschool groups usually have several monthly book clubs for a variety of age ranges, a movie night or 3, potluck/picnic/park days (usually around lunchtime) once a week, board game night, monthly field trips etc. 3. Co-op. Almost every family with older children that I know participates in co-op. In areas that have a lot of homeschooling families, people group together and teach classes, enroll their kids in the classes, and do this between 1-3 times a week, depending on the age range. High school aged children's co-ops more closely represent high school classes - less 'discovering nature' and more 'algebra 1' and textbooks. 4. Organized sports and lessons. Soccer, gymnastics, dance, baseball are all very popular with the people we know. Lessons like guitar and piano are also popular. So the difficulty is not that there are not many ways to socialize. Usually the socialization problems that a homeschooling parent deal with are a) exclusionary groups based on specific religions. Many of the groups force you to sign a waiver agreeing that you not only are a christian, but that you believe in very specific tenants of christianity that the group founder(s) believe in, such as opposing homosexuality. and b) sorting out the 'good stuff' from the 'fluff' and trying to ensure you are not wasting your time on useless activities. Figure out a way to tackle those two issues (and the religious group one really is not hard at all) and everything from there is fairly simple. If there is funds to hire a group activities organizer instead of relying on busy parents to volunteer time to organize activities whenever they feel like it, your groups will be on rails. Biggest struggle with online learning is locking out access to the general 'internet' and gaming while doing schoolwork. Electronic ways for the kids to connect socially are generally ignored. Pretty much no one wants their kids to have access to internet while they are completing schoolwork.",think would little light subject currently homeschool kid always hear socialization question regarding homeschooling let let something one actually want sit home kid day interacting anyone one literally never met homeschooling parent want socialize parent let kid interact kid common way homeschooling family socialize church religious homeschooled know people church kid almost every single day time day youth group bible study sunday service wednesday service choir practice etc homeschool group everyone know member least homeschool group homeschool group usually several monthly book club variety age range movie night potluck picnic park day usually around lunchtime week board game night monthly field trip etc co op almost every family older child know participates co op area lot homeschooling family people group together teach class enroll kid class time week depending age range aged child co ops closely represent class le discovering nature algebra textbook organized sport lesson soccer gymnastics dance baseball popular people know lesson like guitar piano also popular difficulty many way socialize usually socialization problem homeschooling parent deal exclusionary group based specific religion many group force sign waiver agreeing christian believe specific tenant christianity group founder believe opposing homosexuality i sorting good stuff fluff trying ensure wasting time useless activity figure way tackle two issue religious group one really hard everything fairly simple fund hire group activity organizer instead relying busy parent volunteer time organize activity whenever feel like group rail biggest struggle online learning locking access general internet gaming schoolwork electronic way kid connect socially generally ignored pretty much one want kid access internet completing schoolwork

highschoolteachers,"I feel like this is one of those situations where the student's behavior is best described by that Big Lebowski meme - you know, ""you are not wrong, you are just being an asshole."" I also teach SpEd social studies, as well as gen-ed and CTT classes, so the following is how I would deal with this situation. Feel free to modify or pick and choose from my strategies, as I am sure you are a caring professional and can evaluate which techniques may be more or less effective based on your teaching persona and relationship with the student. 1. **Acknowledge that the student is correct - the way their classes have been planned is bullshit.** It sounds like you have already taken this step, and even better that you have actively tried to advocate for this student (awesome!). You have clearly done a great job of bringing this student's concerns to the admins. Have you communicated this to her? Often I find my students become much more receptive and understanding when I lay out exactly what steps I have taken on their behalf, as well as communicating clearly what is and is not within my power (e.g. no, I cannot change your classes but I can bring up the issues you have been having at our weekly department meeting to see if they can be resolved in some way). 2. **Explain that you know the American educational system is full of bullshit, and be honest about your frustrations with it (especially those that include her!)** It sounds like some of her complaints may be based on a little bit of culture shock. I have been very taken aback by societal/cultural standards when I traveled as an adult, and I can only imagine how much more intense it would be to go through the same thing while also having to navigate a foreign educational system as a 17yr old. Again, it sounds like you have done a good job of understanding her frustration and doing what you can to meet her needs. It may ease the friction if you communicate in a more explicit way that you *agree* with many of her points, and that you are frustrated as well because you have to deal with the fallout from the both sides. This is also another chance for you to point out examples of your advocacy for her, and specify ways that she can advocate for herself. 3. **Encourage the student to advocate for herself.** Based on your description of her, she does not have a problem with being soft-spoken. While this can be a pain in the ass for you to deal with on a day-to-day basis, this is also a quality that you can teach her to harness so that she can use her powers for good. :) Since you have already made a point to bring her concerns to the administration, encourage **her** to bring them up to the admins. I have seen multiple situations in which the administration will blow off a teacher's concerns, but a persistent student can get results. Tell her that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Additionally, I wonder if the exchange program is okay with the fact that this student is being placed in classes several years below her level - does not seem like she is getting much educationally from the experience, and if she is supposed to be getting credits for her time it definitely does not make sense to have her in sophomore classes if she is a senior. Ask her if she is communicated with her exchange program about this problem, and encourage her to do so if she has not. 4. **Talk to her about what she has previously studied, find out what she is interested in, and come up with an extension plan together.** Your idea to give her more challenging work specifically is completely spot-on, you just have to assess her in order to plan accordingly. I have found that students who have her mindset often have no problem at all taking assessment/placement tests, so if it makes her skill levels clearer to you (or your admins) just ask her respectfully if she would be willing to take some assessments in the hopes that you can either design a more challenging curriculum for her, or she can use the data to convince the administration to move her to classes that are more challenging and suitable for her. Ask her about her plans for the future and what she likes to study - if she is particularly interested in some topic or subject, give her a giant college-level research project that she can work on during her class. Alternately, since she is a senior in Germany she may have college planning to do or applications/essays to write. You could allow her to work on these during your class for credit, so that she does not have to participate in a lesson about something she has already learned. Bonus: she will be too busy to belittle her classmates and teachers. :) 5. **Refuse to permit her bullying. Be clear with the student about exactly *why* her comments in class are neither helpful nor appreciated, but frame it positively and without attacking the student as much as possible.** If she is belittling teachers or shaming students about their abilities in class, that is completely unacceptable and I hope you are making a point to shut that shit down immediately and publicly. As opposed to Germany, we do not have separate schools for special education/vocational ed/college prep students. This is something that is completely out of your (or your students') hands. If she is being a brat because she does not like the ""system"" make it very clear that she is welcome to take her concerns to the admins or her program supervisors, but they are not helpful, welcome, or effective when directed toward her teachers or peers. Additionally, the whole idea of participating in an exchange program is experiencing and learning from different cultures, whether or not you agree with how they do things. This is a situation where you can pull her aside for a sidebar the first time she pulls this act, but after 1 warning/sidebar you need to address it in class and follow any disciplinary procedures (write-up, call to host family) necessary. It is okay for her to be upset about her situation, it is not okay for her to be a jerk to other students and her teachers because she is not enjoying her exchange program. This is non-negotiable, because even if she is not learning academically she clearly needs additional socialization in how to deal with her frustrations in an acceptable manner. 6. **Encourage the student to ""tutor"" other students, aid her classmates, or act as a teaching assistant in exchange for extra credit or a written recommendation.** If she really is that far ahead and there is no way she is going anywhere, one way to counter the high-and-mighty attitude is to stroke her ego. Have her work with 1 or 2 students who could use some extra help, and base her class credit on this work. Ask her to be your TA and be responsible for attendance, grading, etc - because you know *she* can take care of it no problem. :) Make her a peer leader when you are doing peer editing/writing (she may require some coaching on how to provide feedback) so that some of the proofreading pressure is taken off you and she feels like she is not wasting her time. All of this can be framed very positively, and you can present it in such a way that emphasizes her *leadership* and *generosity* in assisting her classmates. 7. **Emphasize the extracurricular and social aspects of American high school.** She may be completely bored by the academic component of high school, but to be honest I know a lot of American students who would reply, ""welcome to the club."" However, there are lots of extracurricular and social opportunities offered by American high schools that may not be available in Germany (and if they are, they definitely take a different form). It is starting to warm up outside - is she interested in sports? Does your school have any extracurricular activities that align with her interests? (See #4) Ask her how she is enjoying living with her host family... Is it possible that some of her bad attitude is due to homesickness or friction with her hosts? If so, that is an even better reason she should be getting out and experiencing **everything** about American culture. This might help her loosen up in class, as well as help her enjoy her time here a bit more. If she is not a social person and is truly appalled by the American educational system, talk to her about starting a journal or blog about her experiences and opinions so that she has an outlet other than your class. I hope these ideas help, I know how frustrating when a student has a bad attitude and ends up dragging down the class. It sounds like you have definitely taken steps to address the issue in class as well as her concerns, so just keep communicating and building that relationship. Luckily you have got a few months to work on her, and it sounds like showing her respect and treating her like an adult will get her on your side very quickly.

I went to an inservice (that was not required by my school and was on my own time) about college readiness and mathematics at the community college. Most of the people there were high school teachers. The presenter mentioned that they had a position open for a remedial math teacher - all you needed were high school credentials and experience teaching math at the high school level. I went and talked to her after the presentation ended, submitted my resume, and emailed her. A couple weeks later she asked me to come in and fill out paperwork. There was not even an interview. I guess that is what they call networking. The same community college approached me to teach GED classes, but I figure 5 jobs would be a little over the top. Although I have done it before. Sometimes I work as a handywoman during the summer. Sometimes I teach summer school. Sometimes I go to Disney World. Depends on how much I need money that year, and how much I need to relax.

highschoolteachers,"Teaching history is awesome, and you absolutely will make a difference in their lives just by being enthusiastic, consistent, fair and firm. Some of your kids will have never seen that in action and will eat it up; others will rebel against it. The public speaking thing you will get used to...teenagers can be intimidating (they are like dogs in packs...they smell fear). Fake it til you make it. A big thing to be careful of is this: when it comes to teaching high school, you are dealing with kids who are often teetering on the edge of control. When they succeed, teachers are relegated to the background (even if you know better, be prepared for no one - including, often, the students themselves - to recognize you); when they fail, teachers take the blame. Their successes are theirs, their failures are yours (or the school's). Keep the long-term view...when they make bad decisions, YOU have not failed. Most of them will, eventually, get there and grow up. Some will not. You cannot save the world - and this is a disappointing aspect of teaching, because so often you will see the potential, see the danger growing, and end up standing helplessly by while the train crashes. But when, after a year or two, students start coming back to you saying that they miss your class, or you run into them in the store and they are telling you about their triumphs in college, or you get facebook messages ten years later asking for reference letters or insight into something that is happening in the world or just to say 'thanks' - there is nothing like it on earth.

What I found was that 7th graders were way more willing to jump in with two feet than, say, 9th graders while at the same time being much more likely to actively ""socialize"" with teachers than sophomores and juniors. Seniors are a breed apart and can go either way, being the worst students because they are almost ""done"" or the best because they are the big-men-on-campus and they do not need to impress anyone by being ""cool"" anymore. Basically, my experiences in the classroom changed my mind to the point where I would choose a middle school position over a high school position just for the excitement the students bring.",went education program pretty much set wanted teach science field experience time the the grader fun found the grader way willing jump two foot say the grader time much likely actively socialize teacher sophomore junior senior breed apart go either way worst student almost done best big men campus need impress anyone cool anymore basically experience classroom changed mind point would choose position position excitement student bring
highschoolteachers,"I teach full-time at a private high school. My class sizes range from 4 students in my smallest class, to 16 in my biggest; on average, my classes tend to range from 8-12 students. I am not in the USA, so I do not know if that makes a difference but there are some differences - in my experience - between private and public. I find in private school the parents are more involved - after all, they are paying out of pocket. Make sure you have reasoning behind your grades, and justification for your assignments (that they tie with curriculum well, etc.). As for the students - while I still have a range of ability in my class, even the lower students have higher expectations than on average (at least from my experience). As a result, I (and my employers) often have higher expectations with what I teach - again, goes with the whole people are directly paying for this logic. I have significantly fewer behaviour problems; I have not sent a student out of my class or to the principal all year. It really depends on the atmosphere of the school though.

highschoolteachers,"I grew up wanting to teach and coach. Coaching is definitely easier if you are a teacher and I think coaching helps in the classroom (especially if you coach a big sport in that school or area). I teach math right now, but have taught Social studies and language arts all at the middle school. I coach basketball at the middle school and this year I started helping at the high school. Next year I plan to just do high school. I gave up a lot of time to coaching during the winter months. I practiced an hour and a half each day at the middle school. On days of early practices I then went to the high school for another 2 hours of practice. There were some nights where nearly 5 hours were dedicated between the two teams. I love coaching, I figured if I got into coaching it would be for baseball or golf, but am loving coaching basketball. Coaching helps me build relationships with students, especially some of your more difficult students. I teach 6th grade, before they are able to try out for basketball. EVERY 6th grade boy thinks they can ball, so they are extra good in my class thinking that I will keep them on the team based solely on my class. Teaching has been everything I thought and much more. I never saw myself teaching in the environment that I am in, but I think it has made me a better person. I grew up very affluent to where if I ever needed anything I had it. I now teach in a different state, in a different region of the US. Have a large percentage of poor minority students. Some of these students have seen more in their young lives than I have in 25 years. I only have one issue with coaching and that is that other teachers think I am their solution to classroom management. I do not know how many emails I got this year about X and Y not focusing on class work or playing on their chromebook. Yes they will run for this at practice but this is simple stuff that I do not need you wasting my time with. If you are only getting into teaching to coach I would advise against it. If you want to teach and coach then go for it, but be ready to give up a ton of time and energy. I would recommend not doing anything your first year or two. My first year I helped at the middle school. I had a terrible class load and it was one of the few things that kept me sane. Without it I do not know if I would have stayed at my school. Although I helped I did not have to give up more than about an hour each day.",grew wanting teach coach coaching definitely easier teacher think coaching help classroom especially coach big sport area teach math right taught social study language art coach basketball year started helping next year plan gave lot time coaching winter month practiced hour half day day early practice went another hour practice night nearly hour dedicated two team love coaching figured got coaching would baseball golf loving coaching basketball coaching help build relationship student especially difficult student teach the grade able try basketball every the grade boy think ball extra good class thinking keep team based solely class teaching everything thought much never saw teaching environment think made better person grew affluent ever needed anything teach different state different region u large percentage poor minority student student seen young life year one issue coaching teacher think solution classroom management know many email got year i focusing class work playing chromebook yes run practice simple stuff need wasting time getting teaching coach would advise want teach coach go ready give ton time energy would recommend anything first year two first year helped terrible class load one thing kept sane without know would stayed although helped give hour day

highschoolteachers,"I am not sure what grade level you are preparing for, but I got a lot out of Harry Wong's *The First Days of School,* even though it is obviously written with elementary school teachers in mind (I teach high school). You can get it for three or four bucks, used, online. What would I recommend personally though? 1. Have a system for dealing with absent work that works for you and that you can stick with all year. In a nutshell, mine includes a big calendar on a huge cork board. Kids go there to see what they missed. All handouts are in file folders on the board; I date them by putting a post-it on the outside of the folder. There is a 2nd calendar for them to pencil in their name if they need to make up a test/quiz after school. 2. Have a system for dealing with late work. I give them two chances, and then their work gets a zero. I put a check mark by their name on the same clipboard where I tally their tardies and restroom/drink/locker passes. 3. Be firm but fair. Expect good behavior and respect, and when that is not happening, follow through with your management plan. My plan goes like this: proximity, verbal prompting, verbal warning, time out in the hall for five minutes, discussion in the hall, trip to the counselor, trip to the dean (+referral). I will skip steps if necessary. 4. Have high expectations, but make sure they are realistic, too. Pre-assessments help me figure out where to set my expectations. My goal is to challenge everyone, and that might mean different things for different kids. Expect effort and growth, and if you are not seeing it, touch base with the student individually. If they do poorly on something, I write notes on the work encouraging them and offering suggestions about how to do better next time. If they are really slipping, I chat with them after class. It helps to have a notecard to write action items on (things they can re-do/correct; upcoming tests/quizzes/assignments). Basically, be super organized and have high expectations. Finally, grading sucks. 1) You do not have to grade everything! Give completion points, check work in class together, do practice assignments that they check themselves and do not even turn in. 2) You do not have to feel bad about grading during class time. Give them something to do, and make it clear that they can come up to your desk if they need help.",sure grade level preparing got lot harry wong first day even though obviously written teacher mind teach get three four buck used online would recommend personally though system dealing absent work work stick year nutshell mine includes big calendar huge cork board kid go see missed handout file folder board date putting post outside folder and calendar pencil name need make test quiz system dealing late work give two chance work get zero put check mark name clipboard tally tardies restroom drink locker pass firm fair expect good behavior respect happening follow management plan plan go like proximity verbal prompting verbal warning time hall five minute discussion hall trip counselor trip dean referral skip step necessary expectation make sure realistic pre assessment help figure set expectation goal challenge everyone might mean different thing different kid expect effort growth seeing touch base student individually poorly something write note work encouraging offering suggestion better next time really slipping chat class help notepad write action item thing correct upcoming test quiz assignment basically super organized expectation finally grading suck grade everything give completion point check work class together practice assignment check even turn feel bad grading class time give something make clear come desk need help

Last year, when a student died, I first found out from a student over the weekend and then the admin emailed us. On Monday, another email was sent to notify us how to tell the kids, and where the grief counselors were located in the school, and how to send students to them. Topics for general discussion on grief were given, or the option to do something low key. After lunch, counsellors were made available to teachers (I certainly needed it and she was not even my student. Just my students best friend, and that was very overwhelming). A few days later, the funeral was announced and we were directed to mark kids absent anyway and tell them the absence was unexcused. 90% of the kids went anyway.",usual lost kid every year year row one year last year student died first found student weekend admin emailed u monday another email sent notify u tell kid grief counselor located send student topic general discussion grief given option something low key lunch counsellor made available teacher certainly needed even student student best friend overwhelming day later funeral announced directed mark kid absent anyway tell absence unexcused kid went anyway
highschoolteachers,"I am in my eighth year of teaching (I have taught both middle and high school). I do think you have made some mistakes here. First, the ""students' rights"" lesson is probably a questionable idea for middle school students. At that young age, they probably do not have the kind of intellectual/emotional maturity to responsibly grasp that concept. (Remember that the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for foresight, does not mature until a person is in his/her TWENTIES. Middle schoolers are light years from that point.) I am frankly not surprised that they misunderstood your intent and staged a ""protest."" The nature of a (pre-)teen is to view the world as one of perpetual injustice. Everything is ""unfair"" from their perspective. Second, maybe I am misreading you but it does sound like you are internalizing your students' complaints about these other teachers - like you accept their complaints at face value. You may not realize this, but the teachers that the kids all bitch about are often very GOOD at their jobs, especially when it comes to classroom management, which is why the students complain after the fact - they are afraid to act out in class. Never forget that there is a reason why all your colleagues have survived as long as they have in this profession. If you have never actually seen them teach, why should you doubt their ability? Because a 13-year-old said they were not good? Third, you should NEVER tell another teacher that the kids do not like him/her. That is rude, no matter how you phrase it. No one wants to hear that other people do not like them. And yes, it gives off the impression that you are siding with the students. Do not ever say something like that. I can imagine why you have been allowing your students to vent about other teachers. You are in your first year, and perhaps struggling a bit with your self-confidence. When you hear your kids complain about their other teachers, on some level it makes you feel better about yourself, because 1) at least it is not about you; 2) it suggests that you might not be the only struggling teacher and 3) it perhaps makes you think the kids are letting you into their confidence. But this is wrong, and it is not the way to earn respect for yourself from your students and colleagues. You should defend your colleagues if your kids start complaining: ""This is not a place for negativity"" or something like that. Now, if a student just will not stop complaining about a teacher, do this: Go to said teacher, and ask him/her ""Do you have [name] in your class? After he/she says yes, ask ""How is [name] doing?"" You will get the other side of the story without ever causing offense to the other teacher, and in fact, you will find that in the vast majority of the cases, the student is full of crap and the teacher has a point.",eighth year teaching taught think made mistake first student right lesson probably questionable idea student young age probably kind intellectual emotional maturity responsibly grasp concept remember prefrontal cortex part brain responsible foresight mature person twenty schoolers light year point frankly surprised misunderstood intent staged protest nature pre teen view world one perpetual injustice everything unfair perspective second maybe misreading sound like internalizing student complaint teacher like accept complaint face value may realize teacher kid bitch often good job especially come classroom management student complain fact afraid act class never forget reason colleague survived long profession never actually seen teach doubt ability year old said good third never tell another teacher kid like rude matter phrase one want hear people like yes give impression siding student ever say something like imagine allowing student vent teacher first year perhaps struggling bit self confidence hear kid complain teacher level make feel better least suggests might struggling teacher perhaps make think kid letting confidence wrong way earn respect student colleague defend colleague kid start complaining place negativity something like student stop complaining teacher go said teacher ask name class say yes ask name get side story without ever causing offense teacher fact find vast majority case student full crap teacher point

highschoolteachers,"I did my student teaching in a classroom of freshman with heavily integrated technology last fall. Next fall the whole high school will be one to one and the teachers, especially the younger ones, have been telling admin to expect a lot of issues because, to older folks (in this context, even as young as mid 30s us old), these students are ""tech native"". These students grew up in the computer era. But my freshmen were just, pure and simple, well below where my generation was in terms of computer usage. I was born in 1985, so I came of age in the era of instant messaging, chat rooms, and PC computer games...I am ""tech native"", basically. My students are coming of age in the era of texting, social media, and mobile or console gaming. They can use these tools fine but they missed the intermediate step I learned of having to navigate a computer interface to get to my AOL instant messenger, etc. And that extra step is where I learned the ""language"" of Windows and Mac based computers, the commands, shortcuts, and such that are constant across programs. I am not talking programming, I am talking very simple things like copy/paste, CTRL+C. It is not a problem with the students, they are just growing up in their world. The problem is with their early education. When I was in elementary school, I had regular typing classes in the library once or twice a week starting in about 3rd grade. By 7th grade, I had to be able to type 60 words per minute without being able to see my hands. This was nothing special...everyone in my district could do it. Many of my freshmen last fall had technology courses with a fellow student teacher and she would regularly complain that they could not cover the material their curriculum called for because the first month and a half was just learning to type on something that was not a three and a half inch touchscreen.

highschoolteachers,"As a parent and teacher, there are things, you can do. My middle son was very bright but not motivated, because school was too easy, and at the same time he was a disaster at staying on top of his school work once he hit middle school. We worked on organization. One thing that really helped was a folder in the front of his binder for any homework. One side for completed work to turn in and the other for work to do. I checked it each night for two months, until he had the habit. We also took away every outside activity until his grades improved. Then added back activities one at a time until he found out what he could handle. Longest 6 months of his life, but made high school a breeze and college too.

highschoolteachers,"I do not think that being a goody two shoes is a detriment; you just have to adjust your expectations on behavior. Transitioning from being a military officer to teaching has been a trip. As an officer I got used to people doing what I asked them to. It was just the norm. I noticed that high school freshmen are just old enough to think abstractly about the world around them but some are still stuck in middle school in terms of maturity and attention span, so it is really been an adjustment for me. But maturity and respect is a learned set of behaviors, so that strict, consistent and fair rule structure and relentless enforcement is key. When I call a kid out, it is never personal and my further interactions with them are always positive, meaning that when they show a ""good"" behavior, I ALWAYS respond positively and do something like acknowledge the behavior and thank them in front of their peers. When you make it clear that things are not personal and you are correcting the behavior and not making it a struggle of egos, there is no love lost. Really, some of my biggest trouble makers and talkers end up being my favorite students. They are cool kids and sometimes it is hard to sit in a desk for eight hours a day so they just act up. That does not mean I let things slip; it is just that I get where they are coming from.",think goody two shoe detriment adjust expectation behavior transitioning military officer teaching trip officer got used people asked norm noticed freshman old enough think abstractly world around still stuck term maturity attention span really adjustment maturity respect learned set behavior strict consistent fair rule structure relentless enforcement key call kid never personal interaction always positive meaning show good behavior always respond positively something like acknowledge behavior thank front peer make clear thing personal correcting behavior making struggle ego love lost really biggest trouble maker talker end favorite student cool kid sometimes hard sit desk eight hour day act mean let thing slip get coming
highschoolteachers,"As others have said, sounds like standards based assessment practices being implemented. The focus is on mastery of learner outcomes, gradual improvement, and grades not being viewed/perceived as punitive. My district has been using this at some schools for some time. All of the middle schools I have been in since I started 5 years ago use it. It does create some extra work on my end, and I think it is far too lenient (high school teachers have bemoaned the fact that the kids have zero respect for deadlines, and their parents also seem bewildered by the fact that they seem to come out of nowhere), but I have worked some ways around it. Our system has a grade of 'Insufficient Evidence' which counts as a zero. It is hard to give, but when a kid refuses to do a project/assignment, you have contacted home, tried to keep the kid on for extra help and time etc. And you have documented everything you have done to try and get it handed in and nothing, then you are completely justified in giving that mark. I have also given it for kids caught cheating, or any other circumstance where there is not enough evidence to be able to give them a grade. The rest of our grades go up in 10% increments (Limited: 50% or below, Beginning: 50-60, Emerging: 60-70, Progressing: 70-80, Advancing: 80-90, Mastering: 90-100%) so any failing grade all gets lumped together with little distinction. If a kid scores Beginning or Limited, I email home, and give them 1 week to make corrections or use the feedback to improve their work. I do not provide retests or makeup assignments, they must fix the original. That is a deadline I can enforce, although I have to accept any late assignments during the term it was assigned. I am pretty flexible, especially if the kid missed due to illness etc. And I do not penalize kids who do not finish in class, need more time, and want to take something home to finish. Once I am finalizing grades for report cards, I email home again to all parents of kids who are missing work, and say that any work not turned in will be given Insufficient Evidence and that will likely bring them down to a failing grade or very close to it. It makes finalizing grades a bitch and a half, but there is not much I can do there. I have to finalize grades, and if they have not turned it in for weeks or months, I feel just fine giving them IE and letting it drag their average down.",others said sound like standard based assessment practice implemented focus mastery learner outcome gradual improvement grade viewed perceived punitive district using school time school since started year ago use create extra work end think far lenient teacher bemoaned fact kid zero respect deadline parent also seem bewildered fact seem come nowhere worked way around system grade insufficient evidence count zero hard give kid refuse project assignment contacted home tried keep kid extra help time etc documented everything done try get handed nothing completely justified giving mark also given kid caught cheating circumstance enough evidence able give grade rest grade go increment limited beginning emerging progressing advancing mastering failing grade get lumped together little distinction kid score beginning limited email home give week make correction use feedback improve work provide detests makeup assignment must fix original deadline enforce although accept late assignment term assigned pretty flexible especially kid missed due illness etc penalize kid finish class need time want take something home finish finalizing grade report card email home parent kid missing work say work turned given insufficient evidence likely bring failing grade close make finalizing grade bitch half much finalize grade turned week month feel fine giving ie letting drag average

I definitely do not question who I am or whether I am a good and likable person just because a kid (or five) hates me. I do not need or want them to be my buddies. But it does not feel good when they hate your guts. That is all I am saying. It can be draining. I also find that my high school students frequently come to me with problems, heartaches, and even with their joys and successes, and these types of chats take a lot out of me. It is not just the classroom time where I feel like I have to be ""on."" Edit to add: I also feel like the perfectionism bit is actually even more important. In this job, there are so many balls in the air at once, and for me, it is impossible to feel that I am doing everything the exact perfect way that I demand of myself. This is a constant nagging in the back of my mind. Then, when you add disgruntled parents in, as a perfectionist, it is hard for me to look at the situation and say to myself, ""Look, you have done nothing wrong. You are doing your best.

highschoolteachers,"Some people confuse engaging for ""fun"" and are wary of making school ""fun"" everyday. The real world is not ""fun""-- work is not ""fun,"" so students need to be able to develop the ability to do work that may not be very personally enriching. Of course, there is a difference between fun and engaging, but mixing the two can make teachers wary of changing up their game because they do not want to be babying their students, especially high schoolers who are entering the world. As /you/drakeonaplane said, it helps with classroom management. Some teachers are strict enough that they do not feel a pressure to introduce something for classroom management reasons. It is easier to do the lessons they have been doing for years, even if they are not very engaging, if you can still keep tight control of the classroom with other tools. Explaining the difference between engaging and fun could motivate the first group, and convincing the second group that engaging lessons actually help students retain information might convince them. And of course sometimes they THINK it is engaging (or it IS engaging for some students), but some of the students are just getting lost in the shuffle.",people confuse engaging fun wary making fun everyday real world fun work fun student need able develop ability work may personally enriching course difference fun engaging mixing two make teacher wary changing game want babying student especially schoolers entering world drakeonaplane said help classroom management teacher strict enough feel pressure introduce something classroom management reason easier lesson year even engaging still keep tight control classroom tool explaining difference engaging fun could motivate first group convincing second group engaging lesson actually help student retain information might convince course sometimes think engaging engaging student student getting lost shuffle

highschoolteachers,"I am in year 3 teaching high school English and this is the first year I finally feel like I am getting a hang of keeping up with the grading (and I am still behind....). Give yourself a break. It takes awhile to get a system that is manageable for you. If you are giving a grammar lesson and do not grade the assignment, just collect it and stack it somewhere. I do this frequently and I rarely have a kid ask me if I will put it in the gradebook. When I do, I tell them that I decided not to grade it and they learned from the process. You do not have to grade everything and you can tell both kids and parents that. For essays, use a good rubric and do not put any comments on it at all. If kids want more feedback, they can set up a time to meet with you and talk about their essay. It is a more valuable process anyway and it puts the onus on them to try to learn how to improve. I do not know how many preps you have, but I will also sometimes prioritize just getting caught up on one class for a week and then I will switch. For some reason, it is a little less overwhelming this way and then I can feel like one class is ""done"" for awhile. I do not usually work in the evenings, but I sometimes go into my classroom for 3-4 hours on a Saturday to organize papers, plan, and grade and I find that time really valuable. Grading essays takes long chunks of uninterrupted time and that is always been hard for me to manage at school. You might also just take a day off school to grade.

Most of your students will apply for a job at some point in their lives. Some might be interviewed by the cops. Others will have to give a speech at a funeral.

highschoolteachers,"I kind of disagree with you and hear me out, student is a high school kid, not a 4th grader, he will soon be transitioning slowly into the real world with real consequences for behaviors. I think there comes a point where yes even autistic kids must receive tough love or discipline like any other child in order to learn and understand boundaries and acceptable social behavior as they approach adulthood, unless the goal is simply to institutionalize them which I think we would both agree would not be a good thing. Not sure if you saw but recently an autistic 18 year old was sentenced to a pretty lengthy prison term for what the family claimed was ""accidentally"" setting the house on fire, a fire in which a toddler was killed. Whatever the reason whether intentional or accidental, whether or not he should or should not have been left alone with the toddler, whether he thought it was a joke or if it was malicious, its irreverent, I think the takeaway here is that he is being held accountable for it by the justice system. I do believe in accommodation, but I also believe that high functioning autistic kids need to understand boundaries and consequences as they approach adulthood, better that this happened in a classroom then somewhere in public where maybe collateral damage lead to a lawsuit or jail or even personal injury to a child, because again, unless the goal is to simply institutionalize these kids, they have got to understand consequence because the real world cuts people very little slack whether you are autistic or completely normal functioning. a grade schooler, yeah, you handle that differently, high schooler likely about to start his transitioning into adulthood and the real world, this is not as terrible a thing as you may think at first glance.",kind disagree hear student kid the grader soon transitioning slowly real world real consequence behavior think come point yes even autistic kid must receive tough love discipline like child order learn understand boundary acceptable social behavior approach adulthood unless goal simply institutionalize think would agree would good thing sure saw recently autistic year old sentenced pretty lengthy prison term family claimed accidentally setting house fire fire toddler killed whatever reason whether intentional accidental whether left alone toddler whether thought joke malicious irreverent think takeaway held accountable justice system believe accommodation also believe functioning autistic kid need understand boundary consequence approach adulthood better happened classroom somewhere public maybe collateral damage lead lawsuit jail even personal injury child unless goal simply institutionalize kid got understand consequence real world cut people little slack whether autistic completely normal functioning grade schooler yeah handle differently schooler likely start transitioning adulthood real world terrible thing may think first glance
highschoolteachers,"Is enrollment through the roof or are the schools so underfunded that class sizes are through the roof? I would guess that the tax base in Detroit is very low. The other thing is that schools are generally funded on a per-student basis. A school has certain fixed costs - an elementary school needs a librarian whether it has 250 students or 500 students. In a smaller school, a larger portion of each student's funding is required to pay for the librarian. In high schools, the effect is even worse.

I also give generous due dates and format, so that they can find the time to get it done. I regard ""flipping"" a science classroom as a total disaster and a waste of time.

highschoolteachers,A big problem with not giving homework is that it leaves student unprepared for higher educations. When you get into a college/university after you got straight out of high school without having to do homework. You are going to be in a bit of a shock. You suddenly have a lot more personal responsibility and are forced to do a lot more work outside of school hours. This becomes even more apparent when you have to write large reports or papers that can span days or weeks. Sure you have the time because the amount of class hours went down but try to place yourself in a students shoes. They went from doing everything within school hours under subervision even. To having a full agenda of preparing/reading and writing every week. It is really hard to just suddenly flip a switch and motivate yourself to do all of that extra work. I see a lot of people here complaining that homework is never done or that its useless. Then get to improving it and create some way to motivate them to actually doing it. It is not just your job to teach them your subject you are also raising them to be adults. And part of that is being able to work on your own and managing time. Do away with brain dead excersises. Make sure to check if the homework is actually done if you do give it. You might even give a grade once per period or year based on the completing of homework.

highschoolteachers,"I have got a couple of perspectives on this. Firstly, as a student I never really minded a bit of homework. The homework I got in primary school was maybe 20 minutes a night (spelling list and one small activity which we picked from a sheet each night). When I got into high school, especially my senior years, I definitely learned more at home than in the classroom. My friends were in my class, I spent a lot of time goofing around and getting distracted by them. When I got home, though, I was alone and would force myself to do the work. I ended up ranking in the top four for four of my six classes. As a prac teacher, I understand that all students do not do homework. I have not set explicit homework as it is not my supervising teachers standard policy. But I can see it having an effect on the students. In class you only have a certain amount of time, and I have yet to see the evidence (in the real-world) of students not doing homework attaining in the top 20% of the state in the end-of-school exam. And I know exams are not the be all and end all of learning, but even anecdotally, students are not reaching the higher-level learning skills necessary for full comprehension of the topic in the small amount of time in the classroom. And then there is the whole point of memory and students not actually soaking things up into long-term memory without further prompting. And considering that 4-6 marks in the end-of-school exam can come from one word within the syllabus, they really are expected to know these things.",got couple perspective firstly student never really minded bit homework homework got primary maybe minute night spelling list one small activity picked sheet night got especially senior year definitely learned home classroom friend class spent lot time goofing around getting distracted got home though alone would force work ended ranking top four four six class pray teacher understand student homework set explicit homework supervising teacher standard policy see effect student class certain amount time yet see evidence real world student homework attaining top state end exam know exam end learning even anecdotal student reaching higher level learning skill necessary full comprehension topic small amount time classroom whole point memory student actually soaking thing long term memory without prompting considering mark end exam come one word within syllabus really expected know thing

Yet my students complain about the burden of reading six-eight textbook pages an evening. I think the concern of any good teacher is that our kids are grossly unprepared for college, and what we are expecting of them is the minimum required to be on that college path.

highschoolteachers,"What do you think students who do not need the repetition learn from your homework assignments? I wish high school teachers would assign work based on a student's needs. My high school senior is taking three AP classes and three high school level classes. Our school tells students to expect two hours of homework a night in an AP class. That is 540 hours of class and homework time per class. They are meant to be equivalent to a five credit college course. Next year, she will be expected to cover the same material in 180 hours. (12 week quarter, five hours of class per week, two hours of outside work per day.) Too much unnecessary homework is assigned in high school.

highschoolteachers,"I agree with you that homework is generally over-assigned. I have three children - two in high school and one in elementary school. The youngest attends a school with a no-homework policy. Teachers are not allowed to assign work to be done outside the school day. There is an expectation that child will spend time reading independently - because that is what literate people do. Parents are expected to help their children learn their math facts in first/second/third grade because that does require some extra repetition. There are no reading logs or math worksheets to return to school. My oldest is a senior in high school and has taken several (many?) AP classes. She is been assigned more work than I ever did in college - plus of course is in class six hours a day. It is just wrong. I would tell your daughter's teacher that the homework is a burden for your family and she will only be completing assignments that you feel are valuable and necessary. When she gets to middle school, math practice could be helpful and when she learns a second language, that will take time outside of school. Until then, give her back her childhood.",agree homework generally assigned three child two one youngest attends homework policy teacher allowed assign work done outside day expectation child spend time reading independently literate people parent expected help child learn math fact first second third grade require extra repetition reading log math worksheet return oldest senior taken several many ap class assigned work ever college plus course class six hour day wrong would tell daughter teacher homework burden family completing assignment feel valuable necessary get math practice could helpful learns second language take time outside give back childhood
highschoolteachers,30 minutes per class for a child in middle or high school could be three hours a night. Does the homework you assign always have a purpose? Is it always suitable/helpful for every child in your classes? Is it more valuable than anything else that child might have done with the time? How do you know? The idea that the children who do the homework do not benefit from it (would have been successful without it) and the children who do need it get no benefit becuase they do not have the support they need at home to be successful resonates with me.,minute per class child could three hour night homework assign always purpose always suitable helpful every child class valuable anything else child might done time know idea child homework benefit would successful without child need get benefit becuase support need home successful resonates
highschoolteachers,"I teach high school science and I assign homework. In my chemistry class, it is a necessity. In order to master the material, students must spend extra time practicing the material. If I took that time in class, we would never get close to finishing the curriculum. However the main reason why I I have homework is because it is a skill and a necessity for students to learn to balance their life between work, family, and friends. Many salaried jobs that you start will require working unpaid extra time in order to learn the material. As a teacher who is teaching a subject for the first time, I work outside of normal school hours. And this is because I want to do a good job. As I learn howl teach the material and become a better teacher, the amount of time I will need to spend outside of work will decrease. It is important that students learn how to prioritize and manage their time so that they can learn what they have to. Because students are the sum of their habits, assigning sporadic projects would not develop these habits because students would not learn how to prioritize their time on a regular basis. Instead, constant feedback through small assignments is the best way to teach this. Once students can manage their time with smaller assignments, that is when they can advance to larger projects.",teach science assign homework chemistry class necessity order master material student must spend extra time practicing material took time class would never get close finishing curriculum however main reason homework skill necessity student learn balance life work family friend many salaried job start require working unpaid extra time order learn material teacher teaching subject first time work outside normal hour want good job learn howl teach material become better teacher amount time need spend outside work decrease important student learn prioritize manage time learn student sum habit assigning sporadic project would develop habit student would learn prioritize time regular basis instead constant feedback small assignment best way teach student manage time smaller assignment advance larger project

highschoolteachers,"&gt; if you teach in the affluent areas your job will be significantly easier simply because the students are from a more privileged household which generally provides them with all the tools necessary to be successful in school. This is true, however I teach in an affluent school (decile 10 all boys' high school in New Zealand) and it is not just parent drama that can be a pain - it is student entitlement and a lack of respect. They are often very arrogant. They believe they know better than me a lot of the time, question everything I do, try to argue with me about everything I say, try to test me on my knowledge to call me out, try to convince me that they should be doing something else that *they* want to do, send every damn assignment back to be re-assessed ""just in case"" their mark goes up, try to get me to just give them all the answers instead of doing the work themselves, tell me how they intentionally book appointments during my class because they do not value the subject (okay that was just one guy, haha) and on. I never had that when I was student teaching at a low decile school. Then there is a TON of pressure from the school to always be working at the highest level, even though some students can barely write an essay and I have to spend ages going back to basics. Not to mention the homophobia and sexism that I have to deal with. The up side is that I feel like they are the types of boys who have missed out on a lot of lessons that will stop them being douchebags and so I am hopefully making them better people, one class discussion at a time. Also you would assume being at one of the best schools in the country there would be little need for behaviour management, but there are still huge problems (although mainly in the Drama classroom). I have had afternoons where I have cried in my office thinking I want to quit teaching because they have been so impossible to deal with, although I think I have greatly improved my classroom management. I think a shock student teachers get is that when they are on placements the class are amazingly well behaved because the associate teacher has made them that way and you are walking into a controlled classroom... get your own class and you will find they are not so perfect and you need to put the work in getting them that way. I guess what I am trying to say is that the grass is always greener and even affluent schools can be shit to work in sometimes. Despite all I just said, I do still enjoy it here for the most part, and I know I definitely have it way easier than teachers in some of the poorer schools where they face far bigger problems - from drugs, to illiteracy, to absenteeism, to violence, to lack of funding.",it teach affluent area job significantly easier simply student privileged household generally provides tool necessary successful true however teach affluent decile boy new zealand parent drama pain student entitlement lack respect often arrogant believe know better lot time question everything try argue everything say try test knowledge call try convince something else want send every damn assignment back assessed case mark go try get give answer instead work tell intentionally book appointment class value subject okay one guy haha never student teaching low decile ton pressure always working highest level even though student barely write essay spend age going back basic mention homophobia sexism deal side feel like type boy missed lot lesson stop douchebags hopefully making better people one class discussion time also would assume one best school country would little need behaviour management still huge problem although mainly drama classroom afternoon cried office thinking want quit teaching impossible deal although think greatly improved classroom management think shock student teacher get placement class amazingly well behaved associate teacher made way walking controlled classroom get class find perfect need put work getting way guess trying say grass always greener even affluent school shit work sometimes despite said still enjoy part know definitely way easier teacher poorer school face far bigger problem drug illiteracy absenteeism violence lack funding
highschoolteachers,"I cannot really help you with the timeline or lesson transcripts from the 1980s, as that is a bit before my time. As an immigrant in an American high school in 1990s, though, I can provide a personal experience: getting into AP classes required good grades and going to the guidance counselor and asking to go into AP classes. Nobody asked me to demonstrate advanced knowledge of anything. I got good grades freshman year and asked my counselor about registering for AP in English, math, chemistry and physics. My counselor did require my 9th grade teachers to sign off. The only one that gave me any sort of trouble was the English teacher. She told me that she thought I would not do well as a nonnative speaker, but that she would sign off on it if that is what I wanted to do. The other teachers merely signed off on the paper without a single comment. I have a feeling, though, that the information you want will vary from state to state and from school district to school district.",cannot really help timeline lesson transcript bit time immigrant american though provide personal experience getting ap class required good grade going guidance counselor asking go ap class nobody asked demonstrate advanced knowledge anything got good grade freshman year asked counselor registering ap english math chemistry physic counselor require the grade teacher sign one gave sort trouble english teacher told thought would well nonnative speaker would sign wanted teacher merely signed paper without single comment feeling though information want vary state state district district

highschoolteachers,"Sounds like an arbitrary choice to me. If student grades follow a normal distribution (i.e., bell curve), then that implies that there is a sufficiently large number of random variables that affect their grade. The key there is ""random"" variables. This might make sense if you took the average grades of a very large sample, like district or statewide... but I would actually see it as very bad if something as small as a high school class showed a bell curve. This would imply that you, the teacher, would be one of many other random variables that averaged out to give a bell curve distribution of grades.. i.e., your effect on their grade does not overpower the effects due to other effects. There is a lot more to it than that, but that is how I think about it. As someone else in this post said, the bell curve model of what student grades should look like is woefully outdated. Hell, the 100-point grading system itself is way outdated. There is no evidence-based reason that a 70/100 is considered adequate or that even grading stuff out of 100 points is best. It is just the way that it is been done based on beliefs and philosophies of the late 1800's/early 1900's. I would look into standards-based learning. Way better than traditional grading.",sound like arbitrary choice student grade follow normal distribution e bell curve implies sufficiently large number random variable affect grade key random variable might make sense took average grade large sample like district statewide would actually see bad something small class showed bell curve would imply teacher would one many random variable averaged give bell curve distribution grade e effect grade overpower effect due effect lot think someone else post said bell curve model student grade look like woefully outdated hell point grading system way outdated evidence based reason considered adequate even grading stuff point best way done based belief philosophy late early would look standard based learning way better traditional grading

highschoolteachers,"Seattle has a teacher shortage. My school started off the year with a few subs in core academic classes. Other schools are experiencing similar hardships. The school that I got hired at has a very diverse community. I have years of professional experience and academic training for meeting their needs. I emphasize differentiation, sheltered English for ELLs, and alternative/authentic assessment in my lessons. That is some of what the school needs. And it is what I offer. Years ago, Florida dealt with its teacher shortage issue by having a more open pathway to certification. To be a substitute teacher in many counties in Florida, you only need a high school diploma. There is an argument to be made about how that affects talent in the classroom and wages. But that is the way it is. Conversely, substitute teachers in Seattle have to have to be certificated just like full-time teachers. How many people with that level of specialized education would choose to substitute teach at a lower pay rate instead of work as a full-time teacher? Not many.

highschoolteachers,"I have been through versions of all 3 (Suburbs, Rural, and Urban). All 3 had their own differences and similarities. I would say the rural and urban districts were most similar, and it is due to socioeconomic status and culture. I grew up in a fairly affluent and boring **Suburb**. * Obviously I was just a student, but most kids were like me and grew up in a community that promoted learning and good behavior. * Most problems were class disruptions like chatting and laziness. * Maybe 4-8 kids per grade level had some behavior issues, but these were attention or disruption related. Even those kids were nothing compared to the percentages at rural or urban areas. I student taught and worked 2 supplemental gigs at 2 fairly poor **Rural** school districts in the midwest. Both had small populations of around 300-400 kids in the high school depending on what year it was. * The biggest issues were cultural; kids in a rural district grew up with hands-on activities and do not translate well to sit-down-and-quietly-work activities. Obviously every school has this problem, but I found it much more noticeable at the rural districts. Who cares about story structure when you have a job lifting hay bails after school and you are contributing to paying bills for your family? * Both rural districts also seemed to have a growing drug/substance problem. Kids get bored and find the wrong kind of friends fairly easily. Perhaps it was more noticeable because of the small population? * A lot of kids who came from great households and families were much better students, but it was not as normal or concentrated as a suburban school. My first and current full time gig is in one of the worst **Urban** school districts in the US. The city's population is about 100k with a handful of school districts, but I work at the ""ghetto school district"" with about 1000-1200 kids in the high school depending on who decides to drop. The school I work at is a small K-8 school in the district's poorest area and it has less than 200 kids. About 20 kids per grade level. * All students are below the poverty line and get free lunches and breakfast. * The district's graduation rate is low, so there is a new push against suspensions and expulsions. This creates a culture of kids staying in school *but getting away with too much*. * Kids are incredibly reactionary and not great at listening. They will comment on everything they hear/see/think without filters. This creates an unbelievable amount of unnecessary class disruption. Every dumb or smart thought is public and there is no waiting for an instructor to comment or help. Maybe it is because families shout each other down, maybe it is because kids learned to raise themselves. Who knows. * Fights, emotional breakdowns, verbal abuse; it is all unfortunately common. There is usually 1 or 2 kids sitting in the office every day for suspensions. * The kids go through so much that you do not see. Poverty, family abuse, family tragedies, parents-who-should not-be-parents. A lot of the things that because them troubles are not even their fault, and it is incredibly frustrating and heartbreaking to watch.",version suburb rural urban difference similarity would say rural urban district similar due socioeconomic status culture grew fairly affluent boring suburb obviously student kid like grew community promoted learning good behavior problem class disruption like chatting laziness maybe kid per grade level behavior issue attention disruption related even kid nothing compared percentage rural urban area student taught worked supplemental gig fairly poor rural district midwest small population around kid depending year biggest issue cultural kid rural district grew hand activity translate well sit quietly work activity obviously every problem found much noticeable rural district care story structure job lifting hay bail contributing paying bill family rural district also seemed growing drug substance problem kid get bored find wrong kind friend fairly easily perhaps noticeable small population lot kid came great household family much better student normal concentrated suburban first current full time gig one worst urban district u city population i handful district work ghetto district kid depending decides drop work small i district poorest area le kid kid per grade level student poverty line get free lunch breakfast district graduation rate low new push suspension expulsion creates culture kid staying getting away much kid incredibly reactionary great listening comment everything hear see think without filter creates unbelievable amount unnecessary class disruption every dumb smart thought public waiting instructor comment help maybe family shout maybe kid learned raise know fight emotional breakdown verbal abuse unfortunately common usually kid sitting office every day suspension kid go much see poverty family abuse family tragedy parent parent lot thing trouble even fault incredibly frustrating heartbreaking watch

highschoolteachers,"Where I am we have a basic sex ed class for 1 hour a day for 1 week. In 4th, 5th, and 6th grade. In those classes you learn what genitals are, how sex works, and about puberty. Then in 9th grade the kids will take a semester of health with a section on sex ed. I took my health class online in high school to free up my schedule so I cannot go into detail about the class. The only know two specifics about the health class where I now work. I know that the teacher puts a condom on her foot and says, ""If a boy ever tells you a condom is too small, you should run for the hills because that thing will split you in half,"" and I know that she will answer any serious question related to sex. I also know there are some areas that only teach sex ed in high school and do not teach safe sex practices. Instead they teach the children that they should only have sex once they are married. Those areas tend to have higher teenage pregnancy rates. As for your questions, 30% of US internet traffic is pornography, and it is very easy to access. Pornography represents idealized situations with lots of practice and prep work. In the US I feel like kids need to learn about sex from an adult, otherwise they will likely try to learn from the easily accessible pornography. I think children need to learn the basics of sex before puberty, but they do not need an in depth class until they are closer to being emotionally ready to have sex.",basic sex ed class hour day week the the the grade class learn genitals sex work puberty the grade kid take semester health section sex ed took health class online free schedule cannot go detail class know two specific health class work know teacher put condom foot say boy ever tell condom small run hill thing split half know answer serious question related sex also know area teach sex ed teach safe sex practice instead teach child sex married area tend higher teenage pregnancy rate question u internet traffic pornography easy access pornography represents idealized situation lot practice prep work u feel like kid need learn sex adult otherwise likely try learn easily accessible pornography think child need learn basic sex puberty need depth class closer emotionally ready sex
highschoolteachers,"My experience is entirely in middle and high school, with students sat in rows facing the front. Hopefully there is something here you can run with, even if your particular seating arrangement does not allow for my particular strategy. It is important that even the disruptive kids be given a chance to stay in class - when they are preventing other kids around them from learning, this is where they are at their most disruptive. Many teachers ""solve"" this by removing the child from class, but this should be the absolute last resort. Instead, **move them away from where they like to sit. Right now, they are surrounded by an audience, and they are in their element. I have found that moving even one of the more disruptive talkers from a group tends to quiet the entire room down considerably**; your mileage may vary. Once you have pinpointed the prime talker in a given area, be ready to move their seat - obviously this works better with assigned seating. You can even warn the child in question that he will be moved - do this privately, preferably before or just after class. Something like ""you are talking too much in class, and it is disruptive. I know others are talking, but you have to be responsible for your own actions. If you cannot show me that you are ready to be responsible, I am going to have to move you to another seat."" If he or she persists, move him (or her) to a corner. I prefer the front row, extreme right or left - this will limit his or her potential audience. Only one person to the side at most, and it will be obvious if they turn around to start talking to somebody behind them. Again, this might not be applicable to the layout of a third grade classroom. Then again, drastic times might call for drastic measures. You do not necessarily have to go full-on rows facing front like the classrooms I am used to, but I remain convinced that isolation from an audience is key. TL;DR - Move them. Right now, they are surrounded by an audience, and they are in their element.

highschoolteachers,"Oh hey. My life Last year. Read everything HarlowMonroe said and I have some more to add. The guy before me at my school told me to have zero expectations and teaching the class has been so much better with that expectation. Assume the students know nothing and you can build from there. In Title I schools, the students are hand fed material in the lower grades and expect it once they get to the high school level. Going from there, I break things into much smaller chunks that they can handle on their own. I can spend anywhere from 3 days to a week on one topic, e.g. Predator-prey relationships. If the skills are not there then you have to show them what to do and then practice over and over until they get it. Presentations are a struggle for me because the practice was never there and students did not know what to do to even start. Scaffolding in terms of steps helps a lot for a project. Even if you have to spend two days on ""How to research a topic"" you have to do it to teach the skill. Maybe a day on ""Finding a good resource"" will be another day and ""how to research vocabulary terms"" could be another day. You will have to show them how to do this if the skills are not there.

highschoolteachers,"I believe one problem may be that this two-question approach is not a smooth entry point for a deep conversation about career choices. For just a couple examples... 1) At 17 or 18, a student may not even be aware of her/his own strongest aptitudes, even if they are academic or quasi-academic. Even with a robust set of electives or extracurriculars, little Timmy may just have never discovered he is a NATURAL at running statistics on the high school baseball games. 2) Students may have interests or aptitudes that they do not realize (nor their parents/mentors realize) can be actual careers. Puzzle/adventure video games have plenty of skillset overlap with things such as archaeology, forensics, and so forth. If you enjoy sports but maybe cannot go pro, that interest can be ""parlayed"" into work as a physical trainer, a rehab therapist, a professional mascot(!), etc. If you are serious about this process of the students making career choices, does your school have any system for them taking one of those comprehensive aptitude tests?",believe one problem may two question approach smooth entry point deep conversation career choice couple example student may even aware strongest aptitude even academic quasi academic even robust set elective extracurriculars little timmy may never discovered natural running statistic baseball game student may interest aptitude realize parent mentor realize actual career puzzle adventure video game plenty skillset overlap thing archaeology forensics forth enjoy sport maybe cannot go pro interest parlayed work physical trainer rehab therapist professional mascot etc serious process student making career choice system taking one comprehensive aptitude test
highschoolteachers,"The satisfaction of the job comes randomly; you set up the plans to work, and, if they work well, you feel good. It took me a year and a half initially to begin feeling really good. Then the whole process of teaching began to feel like a part of me. After awhile you sharpen and heighten your abilities to a point where the whole profession feels like a natural progression, an extension of your normal brain functions. From all novice teachers I know, their timeline breaks up in this pattern: Year One: figuring out what planning a lesson means Year Two: fixing major planning mistakes of year one Fixing major procedure/management issues Year Three: fixing and enhancing good lessons Scripting/designing cool means of engagement Making procedures seamless, patterned, no opt outs on behavior or performance Year Four: deciding on a grad school/new responsibility in the dept., getting timing right Refining curriculum, writing tests, earning grants, mentoring younger teachers Year Five: cultivating learners from day one and keeping them serious/focused until day one-eighty ( a very challenging feat) On (giving up) the false, unfair, self-pressured expectations of the label ""teacher"": You can have periods in your career when you have to be a 6am-4pm teacher, like when your dad's in the hospital or when your cat had kittens. But you should never strive to be the in'n'out teacher; you should strive to be ""effective"" (below is what I mean by effective, it takes work and skill... I have never met a ""day job"" teacher who really does these...) Effectiveness is not a buzzword; effectiveness is a mindset, a practice, a set of rituals, a complex list of plans, problems, and solutions...etc. Effectiveness is about how you can turn any life experience(in real time or the past) into a teachable moment. Effectiveness is about how you can make the environment a safe, openly communicative, highly academic and fun. (If the walls in your room could tell others about the types of learning that go on in your room, what would they say?) Effectiveness is about giving students reasons to desire learning; this can include relevance, purpose, extended sources, fascinating connections, personal anecdotes, after school opportunities like documentary screenings or multi class discussions, etc. You can be an average teacher; no one will really care if that is what you desire from the profession. Plenty of teachers strive for mediocrity. Some are forced into mediocrity; some are weakened by the school systems. I think teaching is only transformative (for both teacher and student), when the student can palpably see the care, effort, interest, academic seriousness, and enjoyment that the teacher puts in. So, what could help these feelings? Success.

highschoolteachers,"Check out Kelly Gallagher's Write Like This. It sounds like these students need more writing in addition to this low reading ability. One thing that he suggests is an Article of the Week. You do not have to do it weekly, but periodic use of interesting articles is way for students to learn about something that is going on the world around them. You also can test different reading comprehension strategies (annotations, quick summaries, skimming once and rereading etc) on the articles to teach the students tips. They can write to respond the articles too. Gallagher's website has articles that he has used for Articles of the Week. NewsELA is another good source. Some kind of independent reading project of low-level but high interest YA books would be helpful too even if that means the high school librarian has to borrow some books from the middle school library. Interactive reader's theater might be a fun way to help with reading fluency if that is an issue. I have had success with Zach Hamby's mythology reader's theater plays. http://www.mythologyteacher.com/ I do not know what your district has in terms of technology, but if you can get computer access for your classes even for a class period or two at a time, Actively Learn is a resource worth checking out. The website hosts different short stories and poems, and the teacher can embed questions and notes into the text. It makes for some good in-text scaffolding. You can also upload your own content to the website to use if you do not see something that you like there, although there is some great content already there from other teachers.

highschoolteachers,"your content is not going to save your management. Start with having a similar and reliable class structure order. Do Now, Mini Lesson, Activity, Wrap Up. Then you format the content to that structure. You kind of in a way have to segment things like a tv show, slot a, slot b, and transitions. That keeps students interacting with the content in different and refreshing way. If you show a ted talk for more than 5 minutes, those kids are no longer going to be engaged with the content and Vocabulary cannot be an entire day. However you can do all that stuff in one day.

highschoolteachers,"Have you asked an administrator or Teacher of Record (for your students with an IEP) for some guidance or help? There is no shame in that, especially considering that you have a high number of IEP students and three preps. Maybe the school can reallocate an aide to assist you but sometimes they can be just as much work. In regards to your class, I am guessing you have high school? I would suggest breaking your students into groups based upon ability levels. I would actually focus on reading levels and use the data from whatever screener your school has utilized. Once you have these groups established, you are probably going to have to alter some of them due to behavioral conflicts. Sometimes I would place a lower level student with a higher group to create a peer mentoring dynamic but sometimes, regardless of the students, they are just going to need some extra supervision. I would devote some time to reviewing your behavioral expectations. At first start with reviewing them daily and then move them to a periodic review. Make sure to post your expectations in the room. How have your groups ended badly? When the students work, what are you doing? If you are doing groups, you should be circulating through your classroom, providing individual and small group intervention both academically and behaviorally. Finally, what kind of devices are available for teachers to use? If there are not any, I would discuss applying for grants at your next teacher based or whole staff group meeting. In the interim, grouping makes the best sense to utilize a BYOD policy and having your kids utilize technology. It is one good way to establish group norms by giving them a specific role. Group research would be one. Just make it clear that devices are to be used for research purposes and not personal use during class time.

Last year with on particular class I held them outside the door before class, waited for the halls to settle, told them the expectation and gave them a chance.

Instead, I have also had exit tickets be a quiz. As for the ""I will do it at home"" attitude, I do not know. You know they largely will not, but I have not come up with a great way to deal with that. In general, I am a fan of just talking it out. Especially for high school. Even with my freshmen, it is a life lesson moment. I called it ""honesty tuesdays"". I gave them a chance to share what is going well, what they like/do not like in class. You have got to be real up front with them and make sure they know how to be honest yet respectful. Once they have had a chance to share then you can say what you want to about it.

highschoolteachers,"I teach eighth-grade English, so obviously are contents and ages are little bit different, but I have taught high school and I was intimidated by group work initially. What I realized is that it can be intimidating to relinquish control, but it can help many students. You could have partner discussions where you put a question on the board and have students discuss it with a partner. During that time, you circulate around the room and listen to the kids. When you bring the whole class back together, you do one of two things. First, you say something like, ""I heard many of you saying..."" or you call on someone who you know has the right answer. It is hard to unring a bell. It is a kid gives wrong information, the other kids might remember it, and that comes back to haunt you during test time. Or you could do a think-pair-share if you have more time. I like to do something I call musical partners where I will play a song and when the music stops the kids need to find a partner. I then give them a question. (It is not exactly an open ended question, but I found it works better when it is a bit more open ended than one or two words.) After they discuss, you talk about it as a class, and then you move on. They can only work with partners once. With my eighth graders, after about four questions, they are finished. You could do a carousel activity where you put different questions or worksheets or activities in different parts of the room and the students have to walk around and answer the questions. Sometimes I do this with a short story or novel. I put a few questions in about five places in the room, I put the kids in groups, and then they walk around the room, answer the questions at each station, and then they move to the next one. When we are finished, we discuss this as a class. With my students, this normally takes about two periods. I tell them they can work with their group or they can work by themselves. It is graders have a hard time sitting still all day, so anytime I can get them up and moving, I usually have some success.",teach eighth grade english obviously content age little bit different taught intimidated group work initially realized intimidating relinquish control help many student could partner discussion put question board student discus partner time circulate around room listen kid bring whole class back together one two thing first say something like heard many saying call someone know right answer hard unring bell kid give wrong information kid might remember come back haunt test time could think pair share time like something call musical partner play song music stop kid need find partner give question exactly open ended question found work better bit open ended one two word discus talk class move work partner eighth grader four question finished could carousel activity put different question worksheet activity different part room student walk around answer question sometimes short story novel put question five place room put kid group walk around room answer question station move next one finished discus class student normally take two period tell work group work grader hard time sitting still day anytime get moving usually success
highschoolteachers,"&gt; threaten to punish the entire class if nobody tells What is this, the opening boot camp scene from Full Metal Jacket? If I set up a punishment system like that, I am just *begging* to be lied to. The incentive structure is explicitly set up to reward someone (by revoking punishment) who falsely turns in one of their peers. I teach high school, so this is an opportunity to tie in game theory with the rights and responsibilities of authority. If it did go down like that, I would probably start by apologizing to the whole class for effectively splintering them against one another. Yes, it was wrong for A to lie, but it was also a poor setup on my part for the reasons mentioned above. My authority is supposed to build class cohesion and teamwork, not dissolve it. Since this is a very effective strategy for people in charge to break unity of a group over whom they have power, have your eyes open if you see anyone else using it against you.",it threaten punish entire class nobody tell opening boot camp scene full metal jacket set punishment system like begging lied incentive structure explicitly set reward someone revoking punishment falsely turn one peer teach opportunity tie game theory right responsibility authority go like would probably start apologizing whole class effectively splintering one another yes wrong lie also poor setup part reason mentioned authority supposed build class cohesion teamwork dissolve since effective strategy people charge break unity group power eye open see anyone else using
highschoolteachers,"It depends on the age group of the kids. This honestly sounds like something my four-year old pre-k kids do to each other. I get a lot of tattling and pointing of fingers. However, my kids also are still in the developmental stages of understanding the difference between what is truth and what is fiction. Sometimes, the child tattling is the one who committed the crime and often cannot remember that they did. Instead, they blame it on someone else. Now, if these are older kids (i.e.: middle, high school aged), they should know better than to point fingers. The way you worded the situation, it sounds as though the teacher just went off Student A's word. Now student A will have that little bit of an edge. If I was the teacher in that hypothetical class, I would have not taken student A's word right away, but rather talked to both A and B privately. So on your scale, student A would be in trouble at about a 3. No serious consequences would occur. But I also would not let it go without saying anything.

highschoolteachers,"I am the para who runs In-School-Suspension in my high school. While I have teachers in to help me for select periods (and I have a radio to get staff assistance when I need it), I am the only one assigned to the classroom all day, and it does get dramatic from time to time. Most of my kids are very poor and black and I am white and from a middle-class background, so a lot of them pushed me and challenged me at the beginning of the year. Things are not perfect yet. I do not know that they will ever be perfect, but I am starting to pick my battles a little more wisely and I think the students are getting a better idea of what to expect -- and hopefully starting to believe that I really am trying to be fair and to treat them with the same respect that I want from them. Last Wednesday was a terrible day school-wide and I got some of the worst of it. I hit the point where I decided I could not continue doing what I was doing anymore. Since then, things have changed for the better. Today was another chaotic day -- lots of energy, lots of drama, and a mini-crisis in my room. Got through it, and felt a lot more able to handle it than I did last week. I think I might actually survive this year. Though if another para position opens up in a regular classroom I have been assured that it is mine. While I may be able to survive the year in in-school, there are people who would likely do a much better job than I would, and I do not mind handing it over to one of them. -- edit -- That said, one of the teachers recommended that I start calling home for kids in In-School. Nope, nope, nope. Not my job. I do not get paid enough to call home to parents. Nor do I have any form of coaching, training, nor request from the principal and vice-principal to do so.

highschoolteachers,"I mean... why does ""participation"" matter? Like, if the kid is learning academically what they are supposed to learn in the class, why does it matter to you if they have missed a few classes? More to the point - how many students do you *actually* have who will miss a shit ton of class and actually be able to make up the work to above the grade level standard to where they would get an A? Maybe it is the grades I teach (and the number of kids, which is lower than high school teachers), but I have approximately zero students who will miss a lot of class and be able to make the work up to standard. Their grades come down through their own actions, not through me arbitrarily punishing them through a participation grade. When students are tardy, they are missing work during class time, and if they do not make it up at home, their consequence is detention during which they make up the work. Students can always resubmit work if they are displeased with their grades up until the point at which it is no longer feasible for me to grade due to my own limitations. Honestly, switching to standards-based grading has been freeing for me because I circumvent the ""you are giving me this grade because you hate me!"" argument entirely - I point to the rubric, and that is it. Parents do not get mad at me because I do not ding kids for late work. All the onus for proving they have met the standard is turned over to the kid, and all behavior-related things are separate consequences dealt with at the school admin level, at least in my school. If a kid is a smart jerk, they are a smart jerk, and the jerk part of that will get dealt with separately from the smart part. My relationships with kids are a lot better for it, frankly. I guess I would just encourage you to think critically about what you are trying to teach them, and to what end.

highschoolteachers,"Strong routines can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Here is mine (Title 1 high school juniors). I greet students at the door. If it is early in the year, I will remind them every day to check the table by the door. They come in. They check the table. Any handouts or readings for the day are there. They grab them. Then they grab their class binder. They sit down. There is a warm up on the board. There is a minute or two while people are getting settled in, chatting with their friends. Then I start the timer on the warm up and they have five minutes to write. When times up I have a signal that it is time to transition. Never been a big fan of clapping. I have tried a bunch of things but last year I started using a drum that students clap to in response. A colleague of mine uses a meditation chime. Then we talk about the warm up, first in pairs or as a small group, then as a whole class. (Digression. How are your students seated? You want an arrangement that minimizes needing to move desks around for different activities and where you can move around freely and keep an eye on as many students as possible. Mine are in groups of four in a rough square with clear lanes between them. A horseshoe shape where the teacher moves around the inside of the horseshoe is a common one for elementary) Then, there is some direct instruction on something I need them to learn or preparing them for the upcoming activity. Then straight into the activity. Notice that there is no time at all from the minute they get into the classroom, where it is unclear exactly what they should be doing, that means if a student is off task it is easy to redirect them because it is a reminder, not a whole explanation.

highschoolteachers,"I spent TWO MONTHS as an elementary teacher in North Carolina before I quit. My elementary school was segregated supposedly by ability but surprise surprise, nearly all of the white kids were in the ""honors"" classes along with a token minority while most of the minorities were in the ""regular"" classes along with white kids who were for the most part, special ed students. I might have finished the year but the district was cheating me on my pay. Although I had 16 years of experience and a Master's degree, the district made me fill out ""verification"" forms to send to the HR department of my previous employers. I was told that until these verification forms came back, I would be paid at the rate of a 1st year teacher. As I recall, my net income for a 1st year teacher was just under $2000. When I complained to HR, the HR director told me not to worry because I would be retroactively paid. This was easy for her to say because she did not have to live on a first year teacher's pay and she did not have to figure out how to pay for my cost of living expenses on substandard pay ... nor would my creditors have accepted the idea that they would be paid when I got paid. I put up with this for two months and later quit. By coincidence, I later saw a news expose about how North Carolina was having problems with attracting and retaining teachers because the HR department in many districts was taking far too long to ""verify"" prior employment and many teachers were tired of being chronically underpaid despite district assurances that teachers would retroactively be paid once they were able to verify their employment experience. **Tell me that Education in this Country is Equitable** Hah! I now teach Culinary Arts at a rural Title 1 school. Title 1 says it all. I transferred to my current location from a high school in an affluent neighborhood. The boosters at this school provided supplemental funding of several hundred thousand dollars. The kids went on lavish vacations. They wore designer clothes. They had the latest and most expensive gizmos ... smart phones, laptops, tablets etc. In contrast I have kids at my current school who are homeless and/or who take advantage of my school's showers, food bank, and clothing bank. Most of my kids have never been outside the country. Our boosters provide cookies for bake sales to raise money for student athletics. Their efforts have generated a few hundred dollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars that were given to my last school. My father came to this country as a penniless immigrant but used our education system and the GI bill to go to college. He eventually became a doctor but it was a hard uphill climb. The rising cost of student debt makes the challenge of a decent post secondary education increasing hard (if not impossible) for many low income students. While America is still the land of opportunity, kids who were born with the proverbial silver spoon in their mouths have a distinct advantage over everyone else. Low income kids from Title 1 schools like mine are at a distinct disadvantage. This BTW is one of my big gripes about NCLB testing. If all kids came to school on a level playing field, then yes, accountability testing would make perfect sense ... but you cannot compare public schools in affluent neighborhoods with rural and inner city Title 1 schools. Case in point - I am at a rural Title 1 high school. In Vegas, they have academies for the performing arts, Career and Technical Education, science etc. Even though my school is part of the Clark County School District, the fact that we are in a rural location means that the kids at my school do not have access to all of the programs offered by the district in the greater Vegas area. For the past TEN YEARS, the district has suffered annual budget cuts. I would argue that rural Title 1 schools (or even rural schools in general) feel these budget cuts more acutely than schools in the greater Vegas area. After all, kids in these schools still have access to the academies whereas my school does not. Over the past ten years, the CTE program has been gutted. I am the only remaining CTE teacher on campus. We have lost automotive, wood shop, and business. We have also lost a Spanish teacher, a 2nd security monitor, a librarian, and the cafeteria manager lost her entire adult staff and now has to make do with student helpers. This year we are facing $38,000 in budget cuts for my school. Where t his money will come from is anyone's guess. I am thinking that we will probably lose another aide. Each year my school is expected to do more with less. I do not think this is fair given our rural location.

highschoolteachers,"Passion is important, for sure. But realistically, not every kid needs to find your content interesting. They need to find it *worthy of their time.* There are plenty of students I teach who despise English, but who are also determined to do well because of their other goals: graduation with honors, college admissions, understanding the news and conversations around them, being informed voters, fighting with people online, whatever it is. You are correct in that students have a responsibility to be accountable for their actions and their education. However, even in high school, their brains are not fully developed. It sounds like you were a mature student (at least in the class you mentioned), and were able to prioritize the lessons there but many of them are not able to do this yet. There Is a middle ground, for sure. I tell students I Am not a police officer or a babysitter... but there is no way in hell I would let them leave the room or skip class. This is a liability, for starters. Attendance records can be used in court I Have known several teachers who have had to bring records to testify in truancy cases, educational neglect cases, etc. Do Not get caught falsifying records. Allowing them to leave or not even show up tells them that your class is not important you are letting them off the hook, which definitely does not teach them the accountability piece you are looking for. Personally, I believe in natural consequences. Students who are not prepared do not often get second chances, but students who make an effort and fail do. Other students see this and choose to change their behavior. Not every student, and not every time, but it does have an effect. As far as Johnny, who has checked out and sleeps in the corner, is concerned? Every day, I invite him to join the class. I give him the same class materials I give to everyone else. I give him the same opportunities. Sometimes, that is the kid who needs to know you have not given up on them. Students inherently want to do well but have been conditioned, for one reason or another, to not believe they are capable, to not believe its worth it, etc. Praise participation and effort without feeling punitive. Johnny, great job today. You really know your stuff instead of wow, thanks for finally joining us today, Johnny! Its nice to see your eyes open for once! I think you can have high expectations for students and expect them to meet you halfway in terms of accountability and responsibility, but just remember that you are the adult in the room, and you have to model the behaviors you want: showing up for things you are not excited about (PD, etc.), being prepared, and being accountable.",passion important sure realistically every kid need find content interesting need find worthy time plenty student teach despise english also determined well goal graduation honor college admission understanding news conversation around informed voter fighting people online whatever correct student responsibility accountable action education however even brain fully developed sound like mature student least class mentioned able prioritize lesson many able yet ground sure tell student police officer babysitter way hell would let leave room skip class liability starter attendance record used court known several teacher bring record testify truancy case educational neglect case etc get caught falsifying record allowing leave even show tell class important letting hook definitely teach accountability piece looking personally believe natural consequence student prepared often get second chance student make effort fail student see choose change behavior every student every time effect far johnny checked sleep corner concerned every day invite join class give class material give everyone else give opportunity sometimes kid need know given student inherently want well conditioned one reason another believe capable believe worth etc praise participation effort without feeling punitive johnny great job today really know stuff instead wow thanks finally joining u today johnny nice see eye open think expectation student expect meet halfway term accountability responsibility remember adult room model behavior want showing thing excited ad etc prepared accountable

That is 10 minutes you can use to take attendance/ review what you are doing or just catch a breath 3.) I speak to them as I speak to most any other adult You have not mentioned what you teach or the level, but regardless I would add this: truthfully, teaching is one of the most underestimated, misunderstood and underappreciated professions.

I constantly am assessing my lessons and refining or even trashing old material that is not working for me/my kids any more. That said, it does get easier. I have years of material to draw on from creating stuff over a few decades. I have learned lessons about how to work with my kids from trial and error (be fair, be consistent, speak to them as you would be spoken to) As an immediate observation that hopefully should put things into perspective: your students are just as anxious as you.

highschoolteachers,"It is not maternal in that we feel we birthed them or have a biological relation. It is that we form incredibly close relationships and early childhood bonds are just different. For example, we are not only allowed to physically touch our kids but holding, rocking, carrying, putting to sleep, etc. is part of our job. We potty train. We teach them to eat, to tie their shoes. We are there for those first steps, the first shaky name write, to kiss the boo boos better, etc. We become their secure attachment that young children need when they are away from home. We are not raising children in the technical sense, but in many other ways we certainly do. No one thinks they are replacing or becoming a surrogate parent, but in a grade where relationships are *everything* there is a level of caring that goes beyond, say, a high school chem lab relationship.",maternal feel birthed biological relation form incredibly close relationship early childhood bond different example allowed physically touch kid holding rocking carrying putting sleep etc part job potty train teach eat tie shoe first step first shaky name write kiss boo boo better etc become secure attachment young child need away home raising child technical sense many way certainly one think replacing becoming surrogate parent grade relationship everything level caring go beyond say chem lab relationship

All of our schools are within 20 minutes of each other, and they are all the free public high schools in our respective towns. I honestly thought my school was pretty darn average. Maybe on the lower end of average, but nothing to complain about. I was pretty positive and upbeat for the most part. And then... All of my friends kids have free devices issued to them as freshmen, open Wi-Fi, classes averaging around 20 students, most of their texts are digital, and the classes they were describing... Poetry, criminal justice, creative writing. Those still exist? They Are normal?!? I mean.... my school has exactly none of that. We have mold and mice, classes averaging around 30, no Wi-Fi even for the staff, just... nothing. One time in 12 years we were allowed to order up to $50 worth of supplies for our classrooms. We are provided with lined paper, staples, and maybe pencils if they are available. (Ok, I always knew the supply thing was garbage...) This year I am teaching two sections of a co-taught English class. There will be 25 kids, 10 of them will be special Ed, and I will get no training on this or collaborative planning time with my co-teacher, who will often be pulled away to do tests and attend IEP meetings.

Would love to see one go really big that can help educate the general population who may not quite realize how bad it is. WV legislators recently passed a law allowing public charter schools in a state that is already floundering. We went on strike and protested because of it, killed the bill during our legislative session, but then they passed it during a special session right at the beginning of summer when we could not strike. They sold the idea of charter schools to the public by claiming it will help our test scores go up, but the reality is our test scores are low in backwoods counties that have high opioid addicted populations and unqualified teachers (because no one with a college degree wants to live in these towns and get paid squat) and the charter schools are going to go to the wealthy counties with high test scores and qualified teachers. The discrepancy in money funneled into schools in the various counties is why our state test scores are overall very low, but yeah let us slap a bandaid on a bullet hole and introduce fucking charter schools that will take funding from our already underfunded public schools. Side note: we had flooding a few years ago that ruined several school buildings that never got rebuilt. I know of at least one high school that is still operating out of an elementary school.

highschoolteachers,"Logically, yes, I think its strange to be asked to be less Catholic at a Catholic school. I was a cradle Catholic and watching my friends in high school turn in late notes for dentists appointments on Holy Days was annoying because the rest of us still had to sit through Mass. I was never bothered by required volunteer hours because it counted toward my Florida Bright Futures requirement and uniforms did not really bother me because I was lazy with fashion. However, I will say that attending Catholic school is the main reason that I am staunchly not Catholic anymore. I can point to the man who was my sophomore/senior religion teacher for that one. The dude was like, fundie-level Catholic, not just Catholic. He was going to raise his kids saying that Santa Claus and the Easter bunny were fake because it would be sinful to lie to them. Yeah...he was a little odd. But even besides those weird things, his Catholicism came through in class in ways that were just plain wrong. In a lesson about original sin, he told our class once that Jewish people in the Holocaust deserved to die because of their sin, just like we all deserve. It was so fucked up because he did not retract his statement or clarify when we told him how it sounded. That Is where I think Catholic schools can go very wrong. They say that the best way to make sure your kid does not end up Catholic is to send them to a Catholic school. For myself and quite a few of my friends, that ended up being the case. Not saying that you are a crazy Catholic or pushy, but I think its important to take your students and parents into consideration when assessing the Catholic curriculum.",logically yes think strange asked le catholic catholic cradle catholic watching friend turn late note dentist appointment holy day annoying rest u still sit mass never bothered required volunteer hour counted toward florida bright future requirement uniform really bother lazy fashion however say attending catholic main reason staunchly catholic anymore point man sophomore senior religion teacher one dude like undie level catholic catholic going raise kid saying santa claus easter bunny fake would sinful lie yeah little odd even besides weird thing catholicism came class way plain wrong lesson original sin told class jewish people holocaust deserved die sin like deserve fucked retract statement clarify told sounded think catholic school go wrong say best way make sure kid end catholic send catholic quite friend ended case saying crazy catholic pushy think important take student parent consideration assessing catholic curriculum

highschoolteachers,"Is this your first year at the school? Are you hearing these things through the administration? I went to a Roman Catholic high school. There are a range of attitudes among Roman Catholics, and yes, plenty of Catholic parents might be worried not so much you are ""too religious"", but too ""anti-birth control"" or too ""women must stay at home"", to ""Mel Gibson"" or any number of other things. (Yes, the church view on birth control is anti, but plenty of Roman Catholics are not anti-birth control.) Parents who might see you as extreme (assuming they do) would still be just as Catholic as you are and cannot be no more be blamed for preferring their interpretation of Catholicism be taught that you can be blamed for wanting to teach your version. Since Parents are choosing this school, they have every right to air their views. Parents certainly *did* air their views at my high school; occasionally teachers were let go because a sufficient number of parents felt they were either not effective teachers or not good examples. The teachers own view on this might have differed, but this happens in private schools. Of course, the school does get to decide their own rules (and live with whatever the consequences of this are, whether good or bad). If they have rules, no ones blood need boil when a parent asks the rule be set aside. The answer can just be ""no"". The parent can then decide whether their kid stays in this school or leaves. This is pretty simple, and an option that does not exist for public schools. Out of curiosity, is the school granting these requests? Mine did-- for those kids whose parents were not Catholic.

My only issue: from what I Have gathered, in order to teach a high school level subject in a public school in NJ, you must be certified in that subject. In order to be certified in a particular subject, you must complete 30 college credits in that subject, 12 of which must be 300-400 level. My bachelors degree puts me the closest to having enough biology credits (I Am still about 12 short), hence why I Am pursuing that certification. If I were to go for my chemistry or physics certification, that would require me to take a tonnnn of classes to complete the 30 credits in either subject (I literally took 1 chem class in undergrad and that is it). The biology certification states that you are allowed to teach biology (which includes botany, zoology, A+P), environmental science and general science. So it sounds like its a little more versatile than just biology.

And in order to be certified in any given subject, you must complete at least 30 credits in that subject with 12 of those credits being 300-400 level. I Am open to teaching other science subjects - my preference is just to teach at the high school level. And honestly, I Am just closest to being able to complete my biology certification, given my bachelors degree.

I have to make sure that I am really clear and specific with instructions and that I take time to teach and reteach procedures and expectations with them. During conferences/at open house, I tell parents that one of the biggest lessons kids learn in middle school is how to be more independent and how to advocate for themselves. I always say that middle schoolers can sometimes be like elementary schoolers who think they are high schoolers. They are still young and emotionally immature in a lot of ways, but they really want to be ""big kids"" and have more freedom. As a result, they love to argue, so my biggest go-to strategy when I am dealing with issues with students is to offer choices and walk away.

highschoolteachers,"As others on this thread have said, not all Asian families come from money. It is somewhat of a stereotype given that Asia is composed of 48 different countries - the socioeconomic situations of Asians and the country they immigrated from varies. Some Asians from certain countries immigrated to the United States earlier and have had the opportunity to build generational wealth. Some Asians from other countries have immigrated to the United States in more recent times and thus do struggle financially as they work towards making it in their new home. Many Asian students who are currently in high school or college are the first in their family to be born in the United States of America, as well as educated in the United States of America. It does not help that popular media further spreads this stereotype through the form of movies or television characters. While there are some Asian families who are in a higher income bracket, there are many families that are working class and are barely making ends meet. However, they make it work by living frugally and ensuring that they have some money to help educate their children and help them succeed in school (more in my post discussing this). I lived in a basement for the first 16 years of my life because that is all my parents could afford to live in New York City and that was all they can afford to ensure we went to school in a supportive school district. Many of my friends who have parents that immigrated from Asian countries had an intrinsic motivation to do well in school because we saw education as our key to socioeconomic mobility. I believe the values that Asian cultures hold towards education are not just unique to them. These values are present in many families from all different countries. Just as immigrant parents who work hard and spend whatever little money that have towards the betterment of their children is present in every culture. While there are Asian families that do spend money on tutoring and prep. resources, it is not necessary that these are families that come from money.

The number of sleepless nights studying after working a full time job to pay my tuition has nothing to do with it?

highschoolteachers,"In Ohio, most of the hiring happens between April-June, in cascades, as one person moves to a new position, their old position opens and so on. As well, for returning teachers, everyone signs a provisional contract at the end of the school year (some people do not, if their place is awful and they cannot take it anymore, but most sign so they at least have a job), but you have until July 10 to reneg without consequences. After that, there are mild penalties that seem to keep people from moving much (although they still do). It also depends on the certification. We had a high school math opening last spring (a retirement) and we got 25 applicants with the right credentials. We ended up interviewing 6 for a first round and bringing back 3 for a second round (although one of them bowed out last minute). I was hired in math a few years ago in mid-July because of a last minute departure. They only had 3 applicants at that time because everyone else was already under contract.

highschoolteachers,"I am an Asian American. My parents immigrated from India to the United States. They never graduated from high school. We are a working-class family who lived in New York City for the majority of my life. I am the first person in my family to graduate from high school (public school) and college (public university - graduated with Honors in Applied Mathematics, as well as Honors in Secondary Education). I graduated debt-free as my tuition was covered by grants. I worked two jobs throughout college to help with household expenses. My sister will be graduating from high school this coming school year. She will receive her CNA certificate as she is in the health program at her high school. She plans on pursuing nursing. My parents never put the stereotypical pressure of school and being perfect students (not saying it does not occur, but it definitely does not occur in every Asian household). There was always an unspoken message and understanding with our parents on the importance of education and academics. We understood that education is to be respected and that is an opportunity that is valuable, especially since my parents never had that opportunity themselves. While my parents never pushed us to our limit in school or pushed us towards any specific career path, we knew that doing well in school was important and that was also important to use our time in school wisely. Contrary to popular belief, not all Asians are rich. I am not discounting the fact that there exist high-income Asian families, but there are Asian families who are working-class families - many of whom are relatively new to this country generationally (i.e. many Asian high school and college students are the first in their family to be born Americans). My parents worked labor jobs and we lived frugally. We did not eat out, we did not go on vacations, we did not buy many toys or clothes. We just got the necessities; my parents always made sure they saved some money for our education (i.e. supplies, extra help/tuition, prep. books). Furthermore, we grew up holding responsibilities towards household: as younger children doing chores around the house and maintaining an orderly home; as older young adults working jobs and bring in money to help with household expenses. It is common in Indian culture for children to live in their parents home, but everyone in the household contributes to the financial obligations and maintenance of the home. Additionally, in Indian culture, multiple generations live in one household. As children grow older and gain a sense of their responsibility and role towards their family, this sometimes does lead to children working hard in their education to ensure that they can provide for their family (my motivation for doing well in school was to ensure that I can help my family move up in our socioeconomic status). In summary, a sense of strong family ties and having a sense of responsibility towards the family motivates many Asian children to work hard in school - they want to ensure they can provide and help their family and parents just as their family and parents helped them. Additionally, a strong emphasis on respect towards education also leads to students valuing their education as it is sometimes an opportunity their parents did not have. Just to be clear, this is my experience as an Asian child as well as that of many of my Asian friends and family, specifically as an Asian of Indian descent. This may not be representative of all Asian families and cultures.",asian american parent immigrated india united state never graduated working class family lived new york city majority life first person family graduate public college public university graduated honor applied mathematics well honor secondary education graduated debt free tuition covered grant worked two job throughout college help household expense sister graduating coming year receive cna certificate health program plan pursuing nursing parent never put stereotypical pressure perfect student saying occur definitely occur every asian household always unspoken message understanding parent importance education academic understood education respected opportunity valuable especially since parent never opportunity parent never pushed u limit pushed u towards specific career path knew well important also important use time wisely contrary popular belief asian rich discounting fact exist income asian family asian family working class family many relatively new country generationally e many asian college student first family born american parent worked labor job lived frugally eat go vacation buy many toy clothes got necessity parent always made sure saved money education e supply extra help tuition prep book furthermore grew holding responsibility towards household younger child chore around house maintaining orderly home older young adult working job bring money help household expense common indian culture child live parent home everyone household contributes financial obligation maintenance home additionally indian culture multiple generation live one household child grow older gain sense responsibility role towards family sometimes lead child working hard education ensure provide family motivation well ensure help family move socioeconomic status summary sense strong family tie sense responsibility towards family motivates many asian child work hard want ensure provide help family parent family parent helped additionally strong emphasis respect towards education also lead student valuing education sometimes opportunity parent clear experience asian child well many asian friend family specifically asian indian descent may representative asian family culture
highschoolteachers,"I am Asian American (Indian). My parents immigrated from India to America before I was born. They never finished high school. I am the first in my family to graduated from high school and college (graduated with honors in Applied Mathematics as well as with honors in Education), debt free because I went to public university that was covered by grants. I worked two jobs and saved money all 4 years. My younger sister will be graduating this school year from high school with a CNA license. She plans on pursuing nursing. My parents never pressured us so much in academics as the stereotype typically portrays. But they did hold a high regard for academics and education. While they never pushed us to our limit or to a particular career path, we were always aware that school is important. They raised us to respect this privilege and take advantage of the opportunity they never had. Most importantly, we lived frugally as we are a working class family. But they always made sure that they had some money saved for our education (supplies, tutoring/extra help, prep. books). They taught us work ethic by having us be responsible for household duties and then later having us work to help cover the expenses in the household. At least in India, children live with their parents but in my household we pay expenses and contribute to maintaining an orderly and clean household. All this to help us become responsible adults. I think it is a cultural thing. For me it was an emotional thing as well. We are a working class family as are many other Asian American families (there is a stereotype going around that Asians are loaded, and while some of us are, a lot of us are still relatively new generation wise to the country). I wanted to help move our family out of the financial troubles we face living in a high cost of living city. In summary, Asian culture puts a lot of respect towards education. There is a strong family aspect as multiple generations live in one household, leading to children recognizing their responsibility and role in the family - which in turn sometimes leads to children working hard to obtain an education to further support their family. To be clear, this is just my perspective as an Indian (South Asian).",asian american indian parent immigrated india america born never finished first family graduated college graduated honor applied mathematics well honor education debt free went public university covered grant worked two job saved money year younger sister graduating year cna license plan pursuing nursing parent never pressured u much academic stereotype typically portrays hold regard academic education never pushed u limit particular career path always aware important raised u respect privilege take advantage opportunity never importantly lived frugally working class family always made sure money saved education supply tutoring extra help prep book taught u work ethic u responsible household duty later u work help cover expense household least india child live parent household pay expense contribute maintaining orderly clean household help u become responsible adult think cultural thing emotional thing well working class family many asian american family stereotype going around asian loaded u lot u still relatively new generation wise country wanted help move family financial trouble face living cost living city summary asian culture put lot respect towards education strong family aspect multiple generation live one household leading child recognizing responsibility role family turn sometimes lead child working hard obtain education support family clear perspective indian south asian

Rather than freaking them out, it actually made my students feel better knowing we had a plan. I was sure to preface the conversation by noting how awful it is that we have to even think about this, but also that if the worst were to happen, I want to have talked about it with them before that moment.",colleague mine last kept baseball bat cabinet straight talked student would freshman senior try barricade door jam handle pile furniture front case shooter get door open least slow everyone grab something heavy throwable laptop textbook large full water bottle barrage shooter get slow hopefully disorient laptop flying lot harder deal people crouched quietly corner physically fight back try get firearm away shooter rather freaking actually made student feel better knowing plan sure preface conversation noting awful even think also worst happen want talked moment

highschoolteachers,"My room is a mix between functional and aesthetic/inspiration. On the front wall, I have all the mandatory posters (behaviour policy, lab safety guidelines, dress code, etc), but they are behind the door so I can refer to them when disciplining a student. Above the whiteboard I have the main command words and their definitions because my students really struggle with writing what the question actually wants. I will refer to this ""display"" a few times per year per class, especially with my seniors. Next to my whiteboard, behind my desk, I have my ""personal corner"". It has my calendar, it has thank you cards from students, it has a photo of my family. It helps the kids realise you are actually a real person, not just some teaching robot. I also have two laminated posters there, one says ""Things I have learned this week"" and the other says ""Mistakes I have made this week"". It does not get updated every week, but it was important for my students to know that learning is a lifelong thing, not just something you are done with once you escape high school, but also that mistakes are fine. I have had so many issues with kids refusing to try in case they are wrong. Along the side wall, I have a women in science display that features 2-3 non-white women because I teach in an 80% Bangladeshi Muslim school and some of the girls, it has never even occured to them they can be scientists. I also have my ""Our Expectations"" board where at the start of the year every student wrote down what I should expect from them and what they should expect from me and we pinned them to the board. Again, I use it for reminding students about their behavioural choices. On the remaining two walls, I have mostly windows so there is not much space for displays. I have two small displays, one about bees and one about Goldilocks planets, on two pillars between windows. I also have posters with lab equipment drawing conventions dotted around the room, and throughout the year, I will put up a few copies of students work. I also have some ""Are you making the right choice?"" posters placed in the areas where students tend not to make the right choices - by the fire escape where they can see into the other classroom by pulling back the curtain, by the back corner where the equipment cupboards are.

If the noise level gets too high, call for their attention, then wait until they are all quiet (continue to look directly at those still talking and their friends will soon quiet them). Then let them know that if it gets that high again... they will have to work individually, or stay in for a minute at lunch.. just a small deterrent. Then walk amongst them and let individuals know if they get too loud. But make sure you carry through with the punishment if necessary. But hey, if they are on task, you are doing well!

Any work to be handed back goes in their folders and they remove it... any work to be collected goes into their folders and I grade it at the end of the day.

highschoolteachers,"I have some tangential advice, and I am sorry if it is not what you are looking for. I wanted to be a college professor myself, and after having taught in both classroom environments, I now am firmly convinced that twelfth grade is where I want to be. In a small classroom, you are ""one"" with the class, you are a part of them, and they give you feedback via smiles, laughs, passionate questions, and general openness. In an auditorium-style lecture hall, you are somehow, inexplicably, not a part of the classroom. They look at you as though you were a youtube clip, and your jokes fall embarrassingly flat. If you look at students they give you no emotive feedback. It is stifling. There is a common thought that college students are paying to be there, and therefore, will be more attentive. I did not find this to be the case. Getting a PhD is respectable, and I understand that, but the experience you get teaching high school will be invaluable to you. It will give you context, it will allow you to teach in a more developmentally accurate way, and it will make you a better professor (by a lot) after experiencing it. On a side note, I cannot help but feel that college is in a bubble. Costs are skyrocketing and have to ""give"" soon. Secondary Ed teachers are being hit with a wave of instability in the form of union-busting and schools being arbitrarily labeled as ""failing,"" but I still feel like it is a more stable job choice in the long run at this time.

highschoolteachers,"It is still elementary school so I would say be a little more in-his-face about collecting work and checking for missing work. You say you have set up a box that he puts unfinished assignments in... then the box goes into his backpack. Is there an organized, specific folder you established with the mom where you said ""This folder is for his unfinished assignments each day. Please check this folder."" or is it just a random folder that he puts stuff in, old tests, completed assignments, art projects, and unfinished work? For a student with organizational issues, we do something similar at the high school level and it seems to work. You did not mention if the child was on an IEP or 504 plan for his disorganization. This is important. If he is on an IEP and you are not following the guidelines this is bad for you. Your job is to communicate with parents about their child's progress. If the parent has told you she does not check the portal and wants you to contact her other ways, you need to do that. Maybe her computer is unable to access the portal. Maybe she only has computer access at work and e-mail is fine but the portal is behind a wall. Since you teach elementary school, you need to check missing assignments more frequently than ""when students ask me."" I am not even sure what this means.

highschoolteachers,"In the comments you said this is for a college level course, that the student had done this before and you allowed them to redo the paper. My first question is did you see a marked improvement between that first paper and the make up? If so, the student knows what they should have done. Maybe this is not the right way to go about it, but I would let the student go to the dean and make him or herself look like an absolute idiot. You already explained to this student once before why this was unacceptable and you were generous enough to allow them to correct the mistake and redo that first paper. It sounds like they not only chose not to approach you with assistance in writing for the new assignment prior to turning it in, but they deliberately made the exact same error with the second paper. They are at fault here. Quite frankly, this would be unacceptable from a middle/high school student, much less one in college. Unless your dean's an idiot or this happened with multiple students in your class(es), I would not worry too much. For the future, perhaps you could create a detailed grading rubric for writing assignments to avoid this. Maybe you could even generate writing samples so that students can refer to for how these writings are supposed to be structured AND how not to do them. Hell, if you are feeling particularly snarky, you should use this student's paper as the DO NOT DO THIS example.

highschoolteachers,"I would let the student make up the paper, for the record, if he/she is going to the Dean. This shows good faith on your part and also allows the student to learn. I would explain that the paper is wrong because 1) he* copied directly without quotations, which is 'stealing' someone else's words, even if crediting, and 2) he did not add anything to the information, thus making it neither a critical paper or a summary of findings. I am not sure what type of paper it was. *he/she in all cases I teach 8th grade ELA. Here is how I explain research to students. They do not get it at first, so I do not think it is always students ""playing"" teachers (many teachers accept plagiarism in various subjects, if it is cited plagiarism, because their goal is for students to learn information, not to write appropriately, so that confuses things). I always do so in 3 parts: 1. The majority of your work must be in commentary on the research, in not just summarizing but analyzing it (I teach my kids the first week what ""analyzing"" is because I use that word a lot) and explaining why this information matters to the focus of your paper and to your audience and purpose (we use RAFT intensely). A summary of research paper will have more summary, but that should also be in your own words. I explain that I am not grading the information**, but rather what they add to it. **I do explain that I may grade the reliability of their source, of course. 2. Paraphrasing is allowed, if cited, but you must use markedly different words if you are not quoting directly. If you change just 1-2 words, those go in [brackets] and you still quote. 3. Paraphrasing and quotations should be no more than 1/2 the paper if a critical analysis and no more than 3/4 in a summary of research findings paper. A summary of research findings paper is obviously mostly research, as it is purpose is to distribute information, but that is not the type of research paper most English teachers assign (I explain this so when they go to high school they understand the expectation when the ""Research Paper"" term, which is vague, is given to them) since they want to see student analysis, not just information. My classes do at least 1 Summary of Research paper (to introduce a topic, usually in the Holocaust unit, where they get a portion of the topic, like Auschwitz or something) and at least 2 Analysis papers a year - generally one literary and one research-based. The best thing I do for them is show them examples of ""Good"" and ""Bad."" I am not sure if you are in MS or HS or what grade level.

If that means having snapchat installed on their own personal phone just to see when it updates and to see what it is, so be it. If that means at least watching a youtube video on what the latest video games are so you do not mis-interpret a student saying ""I cannot wait until this evening when I can go shoot Trevor again."" (An actual occurrence in my classroom earlier this year where students were talking about a specific scene in Grant Theft Auto V), then do so. Worst case scenario, have some go-to kids who know what is up and can fill you in (or are super eager to tell you about the new stuff) before you get taken by surprise, so that you can prepare in some fashion. I was that kid in high school always telling teachers what new neat stuff was coming out (I was in school during the iPhone 1 fallout, and blackberries were popular then) and I know teachers loved being kept in the loop, even if it was not super interesting what was going on.

highschoolteachers,"&gt; I am not sure why you are giving me international data I already know. Because you are apparently okay with being in the bottom third of OECD member countries in academic achievement. &gt; Culture is. Which is why we have standards we should meet. It takes all the other aspects you want to hang your hat on out of the picture. If a students meets standards they move on. If they do not, they need remediation. &gt; Everyone has something to offer, and expecting everyone to fall into a narrow range of testable skills is unrealistic. There are basic skills the states have decided every student needs to master. If you let every special snowflake decide - in 6th grade - to express themselves how they want, then we have reached the peak of American society. They all want to be video game testers. &gt; so I see no indicator that testing is the answer. It is an indicator that you keep trying to toss out as if it is somehow invalid. It is not THE answer, but a school with 47% of kids at standards over the past 3 years needs to be looked at and shaken up. &gt; ""middle school teachers"" There you go with that unattributable quote thing again. &gt; how your having hostility towards teachers and students I want kids and teachers to meet standards.

highschoolteachers,"I do not take offense so much as think you are wrong and inexperienced. I have taught kids who missed the ""passing"" score on standardized tests one year and jumped ahead the next year. Children are not as mechanical as all that. &gt; I do think that if children cannot meet standards they should not pass until they do. First of all, that is literally against the law in some cases (ESE, ESOL). Second of all, we have no real way to determine if kids ""can"" meet standards - just if they did on one day. I do not think kids who do not complete coursework should pass (and sometimes they do, even in HS) but no one who has experience working with diverse populations of students would ever follow the suggestion that we pass/fail on standardized tests alone. All this plan would lead to is less safety in Elementary and Middle Schools (it is not really safe to educate 18 year olds with 12 year olds en masse or 15 year olds with 5 year olds) a greater number of high school dropouts, especially among ESOL and ESE populations.",take offense much think wrong inexperienced taught kid missed passing score standardized test one year jumped ahead next year child mechanical it think child cannot meet standard pas first literally law case ese sol second real way determine kid meet standard one day think kid complete coursework pas sometimes even i one experience working diverse population student would ever follow suggestion pas fail standardized test alone plan would lead le safety school really safe educate year old year old en masse year old year old greater number dropout especially among sol ese population
highschoolteachers,"In addition to all the excellent advice already posted, I would add this: It is okay to say no. First-year teachers are often asked to volunteer for things, take on additional responsibilities or classes, etc. because veterans and admins know they will not say no. It is okay to say no. You do not need to explain, or feel guilty. The people asking are not necessarily being malicious...we just often forget how hard and exhausting those first couple of years are, and assume that you are young and full of energy. And some are being malicious...they will slough off anything they can on you because they do not want to deal with it anymore. Also, when you are interviewing for positions, remember that you are interviewing the school just as much as they are interviewing you. Ask tough questions, make sure you get everything in writing (course load especially), and talk to current and former students, teachers, and parents of the school as much as you can before accepting a position. You might still walk into a bad situation, but at least you do it with your eyes wide open. And be careful who you confide in...almost every school has some political undercurrent going on that you will not know until months into the school year, and it can be toxic. Avoid it as much as possible. And do not gossip. Ever. Ears and eyes wide open, mouth closed. The gossip can be unreal, and can destroy an otherwise great working environment. Develop good eating and exercise habits before the school year starts. Schedule out your days down to the minute during those first few months, and make exercise, hobby, and family time non-negotiable hours. The work will suck away every spare minute of those first few years if you do not guard against it right from the start. And the best advice I ever received as a high school teacher with multiple preps was this: The first year, survive. Save everything you create, and just toss everything that you might use someday into a file. The second year, pick one course to really work on. Start in the summer, find cool projects, assignments, etc. and keep working on that one course all year. The third year, pick another course. Etc. etc. etc. It really does take years to develop courses from just basic to something really great...learn from veteran teachers, but do not compare yourself to them...they have been at it years longer than you have, and you will get there, but it is okay that you are not there yet!",addition excellent advice already posted would add okay say first year teacher often asked volunteer thing take additional responsibility class etc veteran admins know say okay say need explain feel guilty people asking necessarily malicious often forget hard exhausting first couple year assume young full energy malicious slough anything want deal anymore also interviewing position remember interviewing much interviewing ask tough question make sure get everything writing course load especially talk current former student teacher parent much accepting position might still walk bad situation least eye wide open careful confide almost every political undercurrent going know month year toxic avoid much possible gossip ever ear eye wide open mouth closed gossip unreal destroy otherwise great working environment develop good eating exercise habit year start schedule day minute first month make exercise hobby family time non negotiable hour work suck away every spare minute first year guard right start best advice ever received teacher multiple prep first year survive save everything create toss everything might use someday file second year pick one course really work start summer find cool project assignment etc keep working one course year third year pick another course etc etc etc really take year develop course basic something really great learn veteran teacher compare year longer get okay yet

In CA you can teach just about anything once you get your bachelors as long as you pass the CSET for that single subject credential. So, you could take the CSET for both English and History and have the option to teach both. Districts actually prefer you to have multiple credentials. You would not be able to teach AP classes in both subjects as you can only be certified in the subject of your bachelors. Another thing to keep in mind, English is a more work than most other subjects because you will be grading a lot of essays. I would also recommend taking a look at the new common core standards. There is heavy emphasis on reading and writing. Education is going through some changes, which could be a good thing for new teachers because I have a feeling it will lead to some retiring sooner rather than later.

highschoolteachers,"I think standardized testing is monumentally important. I have experienced standardized testing in several states, and the tests that demonstrate student mastery in Massachusetts are almost unrecognizably different from the tests that demonstrate mastery in Oklahoma. Without having nationally authored tests for mastery, we are holding up students to entirely different standards based purely on where they grow up. (Just within Social Studies, where Massachusetts has students drawing thoughtful conclusions from charts showing nations' standards of living, Oklahoma has students correctly identifying the location of nations; where Massachusetts has students comparing two primary sources' perspectives, Oklahoma has students correctly naming the first five presidents in order. This is not acceptable.) If we do not say that there is some basic body of knowledge or set of skills that all students should have, and ensure that classrooms are reinforcing that knowledge and those skills, the idea of a high school diploma becomes meaningless. And every experience I have had in my own teaching career suggests that standards unaccompanied by tests frequently become ignored standards. (As a 7th grade Social Studies teacher, I live this every day: kids do not take a single Social Studies test in elementary school in my state, which means that teachers rarely examine the standards for what they are supposed to teach. Kids sometimes show up with vast and varied experiences learning about the Kennedy assassination for months on end--but not knowing their continents. Many schools cut Social Studies and Science in untested years altogether.) We need to make sure that schools equip students with basic knowledge and skills. Standardized testing is necessary to our accomplishing that.",think standardized testing monumentally important experienced standardized testing several state test demonstrate student mastery massachusetts almost unrecognizable different test demonstrate mastery oklahoma without nationally authored test mastery holding student entirely different standard based purely grow within social study massachusetts student drawing thoughtful conclusion chart showing nation standard living oklahoma student correctly identifying location nation massachusetts student comparing two primary source perspective oklahoma student correctly naming first five president order acceptable say basic body knowledge set skill student ensure classroom reinforcing knowledge skill idea diploma becomes meaningless every experience teaching career suggests standard unaccompanied test frequently become ignored standard the grade social study teacher live every day kid take single social study test state mean teacher rarely examine standard supposed teach kid sometimes show vast varied experience learning kennedy assassination month end knowing continent many school cut social study science untested year altogether need make sure school equip student basic knowledge skill standardized testing necessary accomplishing

highschoolteachers,"I teach at a Catholic Middle school and grew up catholic, but have not attended mass outside of school function since I was in high school. For the most part, you do not have to be overtly religious in any way to teach at a catholic school. Almost half of our staff is protestant and we even have a librarian who is Jewish, so you do not even have to be Catholic at most schools. You will be expected to attend prayer services and mass, start each class with a short prayer, keep a cross in your room, etc. but you personally do not have to do anything you are not comfortable with. I always let my kids lead prayer, so I do not have to think of one and get involved in it too much. Most school have dedicated religion teachers who will take care of the real ""what it means to be a catholic stuff,"" so you do not have to worry too much if you do not know much about the bible. Personally, I hardly know anything about the bible. I have not read it. I am Catholic, I have it read to me. One thing you do have to be careful of is to never hint that god may not exist. A teacher at my school last year was not thinking and started out a sentence with ""If there is a god..."" You would not believe the shitstorm that came down the pipes for that one. Other than that, it is actually a pretty good gig. The pay is shit, but other than that it really is not hard to just play along with the more religious bits and have a good time. One great perk is that you will have an, on average, much higher level of autonomy within your classroom than you would find in a public school. You also do not usually have to deal with as many standardized tests, and the ones you do take are often used as formative assessments, which is a nice departure from the ""these scores will determine your pay scale,"" route many states seem to be fond of taking these days.

Way to achieve your goals, man! In all seriousness, Sparknotes will help you understand the most basic, bare-bones version of a book or story. It is dry and boring and only helpful if you are struggling to get the basics (in which case it can actually be really helpful, say with Shakespeare or Faulkner, for many readers). If you are relying on it for your project, your project sucks because it is boring and you only understand the book's plot on a basic, bare-bones level, and this is a bigger problem. There is no way you are saying anything interesting about whatever book you just (did not) read. It is usually painfully, painfully obvious when a student has not read the material. A lot of times students are careless enough to actually plagiarize the summary they found online. They tend to think the exact same things sparknotes lists as important about the book are what is actually important or interesting about the book (rarely true). Like, oh, MacBeth is about power and prophecy? However did you think that up? You are brilliant, really. If you are in a pinch, and you did not get to read and do not have time now, well, do what you have to do, but your grade will reflect it and your teacher will be able to tell.

highschoolteachers,"Difficult is subjective. I graduated high school with a 3.9 and graduated college with honors and similar GPA. I thought, at times, things were challenging. Not so much content since I was just ""good at school"", but learning to become a more effective teacher is hard no matter how much you read. I think what you are feeling represents a common feeling that beginning teachers feel unprepared and overwhelmed. Practicum is always the most valuable part of any college course. This is where you learn classroom management and the day-to-day dealings. This is where you gain experience working with actual struggling students and irate parents. This is where you encounter positive and negative coworkers. These things cannot be taught in a classroom because they have to be experienced. It bothers me when people claim education is an easy degree. Content knowledge wise, it is probably not challenging. After all, we all passed K-12 and it is our second pass learning. Is this what you are referring to? The ""hard stuff"" is learning to become effective, and content knowledge gained from books and classes is not going to get you there without experience. You could know every psychological educational theory, know your subject matter front and back, and be up on the latest research-backed classroom management strats and teaching styles, but how far does that go if you lack experience with dealing with real-life interactions? It HELPS, but probably not as much as you think. Subbing is good experience but it is not reflective of full-time teaching. I find subbing too easy and all you are really is a babysitter. You have to manage the class, but you are not responsible for planning effective instruction, using data to reflect improvements and drive that instruction, dealing with parents and colleagues, and so on. Subbing does not really teach you much more than the difference between real-world learning environments and a bit of classroom management. Maybe your program just sucks? I felt very satisfied and prepared after my 4 1/2 year teacher prep program. We underwent student teaching, a semester of methods (a lesser student teaching experience), a reading remediation program where we worked with struggling students, and a team teaching experience where we worked closely with a special ed teacher to explore differentiation. I felt it was pretty much the best prep I could get. I took classes on all kinds of things, and they were not always challenging in terms of time commitment and getting a good grade, but student teaching experiences are. It is NOT like subbing and it is NOT always a positive experience for even bright education majors. I have seen bright students fall flat on their face and goof offs become decent teachers.

highschoolteachers,"1. They have to like the students, whatever age level they are. If you are teaching high school, you better genuinely enjoy hanging out with teenagers- they can smell a fake a mile away. 2. They have to have inner-authority, and the belief that they are in control of the classroom. This does not mean that they are loud or authoritarian. Some of the most soft-spoken teachers can have the most inner authority, but if you do not have this, particularly in secondary education, students will not respect you. Self confidence is key. 3. Pedagogical chops. You need to have enough educational theory that you can effectively theorize your own practice. Without this ability, you are essentially throwing strategies at your class and seeing what works. The best teachers I have seen and worked with have always had the ability to construct theories of learning and education based on their education and their experiences in the classroom, and to test and modify those theories as they teach. 4. Reflective Capability. This is huge. If you cannot recognize what you are doing that is not working, how are you going to fix it? Likewise, you need to ability to really recognize effective strategies so you can continue to use them. 5. Interest and curiosity. Students will follow your lead- if you are passionate and interested about things, they will follow that. If you are uninterested, they will pick up on that and will likely be disengaged. 6. Content Knowledge. The deeper your content knowledge, the more you will be able to develop frameworks to help your students understand it at a complex level. This can definitely be developed on the job, but I always like to see teachers who are always striving to learn new things about what they are teaching.",like student whatever age level teaching better genuinely enjoy hanging teenager smell fake mile away inner authority belief control classroom mean loud authoritarian soft spoken teacher inner authority particularly secondary education student respect self confidence key pedagogical chop need enough educational theory effectively theorize practice without ability essentially throwing strategy class seeing work best teacher seen worked always ability construct theory learning education based education experience classroom test modify theory teach reflective capability huge cannot recognize working going fix likewise need ability really recognize effective strategy continue use interest curiosity student follow lead passionate interested thing follow uninterested pick likely disengaged content knowledge deeper content knowledge able develop framework help student understand complex level definitely developed job always like see teacher always striving learn new thing teaching

My students are likely to come from homes where a tv is never off and multiple siblings yell and scream for a dearth of attention. Conversations with my kids seem to indicate this is not far from the mark. Consequently, they try to act this way in class and think there is nothing wrong with it. Along those lines, I quickly learned that I have a group of students (significant proportion) who do not think I am serious unless I yell. I think this is an aspect of their poverty culture.

highschoolteachers,"Thank you for your reply! I did not answer most of these replies when I posted this originally, but I do want thank everyone who replied, because the replies were extremely helpful. Some of this answer is rather depressing. I am sorry you are losing control over your curriculum. I am still rather confused by common core and the way people talk about it; sometimes it seems it is just vague guidelines (like ""teach close-reading""), other times it seems to be about testing, and yet here it seems like common core is mandating which texts you actually teach! Does this mean every single 7th grader in the state of NY is supposed to read the exact same books? That is not a very well thought out idea... I cannot imagine your rural, conservative 7th grade students appreciating and being interested in the exact same texts as a group of urban, liberal 7th graders. *Night* does, though, actually seem like a text that would work well for most students in a number of contexts, yet it is not ""approved""? Again: depressing. Now this was more than a decade ago, but when I was in high school, I attended a school with 5 to 10% Muslim students (a number that has likely doubled in that district since). I remember that the only text we ever read with a Muslim character was a poorly-written (or so I thought at the time), young adult book about a white boy fighting against some Muslim terrorists. I remember thinking even then (as a non-Muslim) what a terrible choice of book this was, especially since it was the ONLY time Islam ever came up in that class. It seemed like such a contextless choice. It seems to me that context is (almost) everything, so the entire concept of common core hits me the wrong way. Academia has its own share of problems, and I am willing to take on the problems of secondary education for the many benefits, so I do not want to seem that I am down on the system before I have even begun. I do hope there is room to move, though, and that I am able to find a job that allows me the freedom to assign books with my specific students in mind. The ability to switch up the planned text halfway through the year because I realize a particular group of studnets has some particular interest would be especially wonderful. I will probablly teach in an urban environment, though I just do not know until I really hit the job market. I will most likely be in Ohio, but Florida is a possibility as well.

highschoolteachers,"I. Yes, I think so. II. This is not a question... III. This is why Common Core is being introduced. IV. I teach history. It is always the last subject to get the official test. Massachusetts, where I live, has the MCAS. First it piloted ELA. Then it adopted ELA and piloted math. Then it adopted math and piloted Biology and Chemistry. Then it adopted Biology and Chemistry and piloted History. Then it ran out of money and stopped piloting history and now we are switching to new types of tests. And it will go English, Math, Science, History, and by the time it gets to history they will be moving on to something new. So it is not a test or fail situation for me. As for your question regarding testing out and not having to go through all of high school or middle school... school is about more than being taught information. School makes you into a person. It teaches you discipline and hard work and *socialization*. So could you test out and go to college and do work that is appropriate to your level of knowledge at age 12? Sure. But good luck being able to communicate with people, ever, without that early socialization. V. My district bases pay on experience + education level. So if you are teaching 5 years and you have PhD and your colleague is teaching 5 years and has a masters you will make like $10k more. But if you are teaching 18 years with just a bachelor's and someone else starts teaching with a PhD and they are like 3 years in, they might make more than you. Pay varies by district. If you think teaching is all about low wages, ""annoying kids"", and you are concerned about responsibility and amount of work perhaps you should think of a different field. I am not treated like the scum of society. I meet strangers and they praise me for teaching like it is some impossible task that they could never do. It surprises me because I was under the assumption that people looked down on teachers, but I have never encountered that in person. I make a lot of money. Next year I will make over $70k and it will be my 9th year. This is because I have a lot of education. I plan to hit the highest salary level I can as soon as I can, so that would be another 30 graduate credits and another four years of teaching. And then I will make just shy of $95k. Factor in the very little amount I pay for health insurance and the great coverage I get and I would say I make more than many people I know of the same age/education level as myself. I am not sure what you are trying to ask here. Are you looking for people to tell you this job sucks? Are you looking for people to prove you wrong?

highschoolteachers,"I know it was a problem when I was going to school, but it is gotten much better. Kids are much more tolerant, but in fifth grade it is probably more based on parents. At the high school age kids are forming their own opinions separate from the home and so you get a lot more tolerance (or not depending on the culture). I shut down any ""fag"" or ""gay"" talk on day one. Or two. Or whatever day I hear it. If students are working and chatting quietly on some assignment while I take attendance and I hear anyone say anything like that the first words out of my mouth are ""Excuse me?!"". Everyone in the room stares at me. ""If I hear that word again you will be writing me a paragraph and I will be calling home. End it. Now."" Generally, I get wide-eyed stares for a few seconds while students get back to work and I never hear the words again. If it were lower grades I might treat it like a teachable moment, but in high school they know better. And if *they* do not then their peers do and me speaking up usually gets their friends to agree so they stop and learn.",know problem going gotten much better kid much tolerant fifth grade probably based parent age kid forming opinion separate home get lot tolerance depending culture shut fag gay talk day one two whatever day hear student working chatting quietly assignment take attendance hear anyone say anything like first word mouth excuse everyone room stare hear word writing paragraph calling home end generally get wide eyed stare second student get back work never hear word lower grade might treat like teachable moment know better peer speaking usually get friend agree stop learn

highschoolteachers,"I am a high school teacher and from Australia, so take this with a grain of salt, but here are some thoughts: You have got six or eight weeks to wow the principal - you could try to have the classes write an example of each text type mandated by the common core (opinionative, informative and narrative) OR pick one text type and develop their ability to produce that type in greater depth. If you try to cover all three, will 90 minutes (two weeks - all you will get for each text type if you are only there for six weeks) be enough time to teach the text type and plan, write and polish a whole piece? You should definitely have them writing every time you see them but with only one lesson a week it might be hard to get them to finish several pieces. I would be looking for some cross-curricular links to save time teaching content (in the sense of what you want them to write about) - they could write an informative piece that talks about what they are studying in science, for example, or an opinion piece based on what they are learning about in music or art, or a narrative that uses prompts from social studies topics. I would also be making use of exemplar texts and scaffolds to help facilitate student understanding and to save time. When I teach a new text type, I give students an exemplar which we annotate together for textual features. Then I give students a scaffold to plan a piece of their own that will include all of the textual features identified. I collect their planning and use that to help me figure out where students are weak so I can address that in future lessons. We will do activities helping build those skills and then update our planning to show our new ideas. After the class is on track, they write their drafts and I collect those for more feedback and reteaching of skills if necessary. I would look at the common core standards for each grade and develop a logical sequence of what you could conceivably achieve in 6 or 8 lessons. Pick a skill to focus on each week (for example, if you are doing opinion pieces one week could focus on introductions and how to structure the piece, one week on how to include evidence effectively, one week on linking words to build the argument, and one week on conclusions). Then you have got the basic outline and you just have to come up with the cool activities. I had fun with my students this year when I was trying to get them to use more effective description in their narrative writing - I brought lemon wedges to class, fed them to my students and then had the describe the whole sensory experience without using the words ""lemon"", ""yellow"" or ""sour"".

highschoolteachers,"I have several students dealing with homelessness (my program works with at risk high school students, as well as those with different behavioral, cognitive, and emotional challenges). It is heart wrenching, and the last thing any student should be dealing with on top of other daily difficulties. Even if it does not work out to share your home, I think it is so important that you continue to provide what you have always done, a safe, structured ""normal."" Homelessness breeds a lot of uncertainties for what each day is going to bring (who is going to be sleeping near me, what kind of food will be available, what is going to happen with x y z). Therefore, providing a place where they can know what to expect is such a gift. Obviously, flexibility on your part is intuitive to adapt to what the student has to offer at each given class; however, to a less obvious but very important extent, continuing to hold a bar can help normalize and structure what their day looks like.

highschoolteachers,"I entered college as an elementary special education major. We had a ""student teaching"" program in my high school and I was placed with a second grade SpEd class and I LOVED it. For a humanities-for-education-majors class we had to go to the Museum of Fine Arts and create a lesson plan around a painting. I chose a sculpture based on Greek mythology. Our next assignment was to go to the Boston Public Library and do the same. I chose a special display on the Sacco and Vanzetti trial (it was like the 75th anniversary or something). As I was writing this second LP I was like ""Hey. I like history. A lot."" and went and changed my major. I teach in a 9-12 high school but prefer 10-12 because 10-11 is US history and I like that best, and 12 is an elective I created, and I like that best too.

highschoolteachers,"So, I started TAPP in 2004 and lasted all of 3 months, until I turned in my key, along with a third of the other (veteran) teachers at the school where I was at. Obviously, it was a bad situation. After a year or so I returned to the world of education, but in a different way, and over the years I have found my niche. I know of several teachers going through TAPP programs right now, and it does not seem to have changed too much in the past decade. SO, that being said, based on what you have written here and on the Atlanta thread (sorry, not trying to be a stalker) since you have not even subbed yet, I am going to say that TAPP is not right for you at this point. TAPP ""prepares"" you for teaching at an awesome, well-funded school with smart, supportive admin, 21 kids in a class all reading around grade level who come from stables homes with involved parents. Those jobs exist. They are not hiring TAPP teachers. While this may not always be true, I am going to go ahead and say that admins who hire unknown TAPP candidates are probably at least a little, if not a lot, desperate, and you need to know why they are desperate. This is not to say that TAPP is useless. I think that for people who have subbed a lot or worked as a para, it is feasible, because these people at least have an idea of the complexity of a classroom and a school and all the rules, regulations, and paperwork (and paperwork, and paperwork, and paperwork.) TAPP does not prepare you for that. For instance, one of the kabillion issues I had during my short stint as a 7th grade ELA teacher was dealing with the vastly different reading skills of the students. I would have to go back through my TAPP materials, but differential teaching was barely mentioned, if at all, and there certainly was no information on what to do when a third is on grade level, a third is about at a 3rd grade level, and the last third is, essentially, functionally illiterate. There was one student who was repeating 7th grade for the 3rd time and he did not know all of his letters. What do I do, what do I do, I am asking everyone frantically. Make sure everything is read aloud and allow him to take tests verbally. Ok, those are examples of accommodations, yes, but knowing what I know now, and I am cringing as I write this, that child should have had a paper trail a mile long, assessments, testing, interventions, support services, etc. If, for some odd reason, the student did have a lot of paperwork that the school was keeping from me, TAPP should have told me ""you need to go ask for x, y, and z reports"", since at the time I did not even know all the terminology of what I needed, OR, if for some reason, a 15 yr old has seriously slipped through the cracks to the point of not knowing the alphabet, TAPP should have been telling me ""holy shit, you need to do this, this, and this to get the ball rolling to get him help."" All that being said, keep in mind that TAPP is not the only way into the classroom. Make GaPSC.com your new best friend. An Induction 4 non-renewable certificate is valid for 3 years, and if you check the site you will see all the requirements for it being issued. You could start a M.A.T. degree part time, online and still keep your current job. If you subbed a lot and got in good enough with a school that they wanted to hire you, you could get your induction 4 cert, start a M.A.T.degree, your student teaching would be your job, and you would end up with a clear and renewable cert AND a master's degree, and the pay bump alone would almost cover the cost of the degree. There is a lot of ways you can do it, but you need to get in there and get your name known. Do not limit yourself to subbing just middle/high science, your true passion might be slightly different. And if you think you could possibly stand it, sub special ed a few times, because if you do go the sped route you can basically write your own ticket. It turns out that while I was a horrid 7th grade ELA teacher, I am a really good high school science sped EBD teacher. And because I have already written a book, I will add some more tips. Get great shoes and never sit down, because proximity solves 80% of classroom management problems. Discipline quiet, praise loud. If you are redirecting a kid, get close, get quiet, get calm, and state what they should be doing -- be quiet vs stop talking, take out a sheet of paper and turn to page xx vs. stop messing around. You do this quietly because you do not want to embarrass a kid in front of their peers. However, when it comes to praise, do it loud, do it often. One mistake I made going in was that I thought 7th graders would be too old to like praise. NOPE! Even 12 graders get off on it. How you do it depends on your personality type, but since I have no problems coming off as a little outrageous, I say stuff (loudly, so all students hear) like ""oh Jimmy look at you, with the hand raising and waiting patiently and quietly, you are a paragon of perfection"" or ""yes, yes, I love this, always do this, never stop doing this"" ""Beth, you are SOOOO on task your picture should be in the dictionary next to AWESOME."" Seriously, read up on PBIS, it is almost freaky what you can get students to do based on praise alone.

What about looking at opinion through the lens of debate? There are tons of debate orgs with materials out there for middle and high school students. Having her do a pro/con case for different topics would force her to at least create an argument/opinion on a topic. She does not have to choose the topic or the argument/opinion, she is just learning the process of forming an opinion with evidence. Start with topics that are external - she does both sides, so does not have to choose one herself, she gathers information/research to back the claim, etc. As she gets more comfortable with it, you can transition towards her choosing the side to argue or to issues where she backs it with life experience vs. external sources. As for novels, you might try reframing discussion. She does not know where to start if she is asked directly. ""Some people think X about this character/scene/whatever. What in the text might make someone form that opinion?"" rather than just what she thinks about something. Give an opposite interpretation, look for information on that.

You basically have to come up with your own curriculum as the year progresses - in front of teenagers - not easy! Kudos to you for reaching out. I just want to share a couple of my 'greatest hits' lessons with my high schoolers and maybe they will work for you. My school requires teachers to have a Do Now at the beginning of class. I had this question on the board: ""Is Classical music still relevant?"" We shared our answers. We then watched the music video for Nas ""I know I can"" and students were asked to identify the piano track he used (I let them use their phones) We then listened to Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"". Next was Muse's ""Plug in, Baby"" where he uses Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D. We then discussed the value of music that lasts through the ages. The fact that Beethoven, born in 1770, is still relevant today says something about the lasting power of high quality music. The jury is still out to if we will be sampling Ke$ha in 200 years.

highschoolteachers,"The last several years, the students at my high school have been given fun activities to do (crafts and games and movies) at least the afternoon of the last day before Christmas break, if not the whole day. The real reason behind this was the fact that grades were due at noon that day, and teachers needed the time to get all tests graded and semester grades finalized before Christmas break. This year, we started late enough that our semester does not end until January 8th, a full week after we return from break. Additionally, the students have been very vocal the last couple of years about not appreciating the fun times and they have been downright obstinate and rude when we have tried to find activities they would enjoy. So the teachers voted this year to have a regular class day on the day before break. Word got out to the students, and they actually wrote a very nice letter and sent around a petition requesting the time at the end of the day to watch ""one Christmas-themed movie."" We decided to let them have it, since they used appropriate channels to ask for it. I am thoroughly impressed.

He was there thirty years and I feel like it will take me some time to get really good at things! I am not very good with humor and actually have trouble reading sarcasm. I try to be kind, but it does not seem to be enough. I do notice teachers who have more humor and are slightly sarcastic do much better at this level.

highschoolteachers,"Are these students in high school? I know junior high best, but I hope I can help. You mention the music is music they cannot stand to hear. What determines the music that is listened to in class? Is there a requirement for it to come from a particular time period/culture? Is it structured around any particular instruments? I would suggest looking at two things: relationship and curriculum. On the relationship front, invest some time in getting to know your students as people. Create something together. Have them teach you about something important to them. If it can be connected to music, that is great- the first song they ever downloaded, a favorite sound. Do some collaborative work as a class to establish the kind of environment that will help everyone work- what will help everyone maintain respect and an open mind? It sounds like your physical environment is a challenge too. Work with the students to figure out ways to edit your space to make it work for all of you. On the curriculum front, have goals defined in terms of abilities students will have instead of content you will teach. In your orchestra class the outcome is probably pretty clear: students will become better musicians, or will be able to perform a piece of music. There are probably other things though, like being able to work together as a team, or practice something until they get it right. Do those same goals apply in this class? And hey, good on you for looking at what you can do to improve. You are going to learn so much from working with this class.

highschoolteachers,"That sounds like a tough situation to be in; no one enjoys feeling that sort of tension when they are trying to do best by kids. I am hearing a few things bubble to the surface (for reference, my background is in teaching high school English and coaching/training high school teachers). It is tough to tell if you are being ""played by the system."" A lot of that actually sounds like it is outside of your locus of control. Here is what it sounds like is within your control that could decide the course of action you take: What type of ""support"" did the admin say they would give you? I think it is totally fine to ask them to deliver on that. Additionally, are you able to contact the beginning teacher coordinator or any other sort of non-evaluative observer? Both your situation and your class could benefit if you were to ask for someone to come in and help you implement a Positive Behavior Intervention System. I think if you went to your admin and told them that this was something you were looking to do to improve your classroom and that you wanted an extra set of eyes to give you feedback on how it was going and what you needed to do to tweak it, then a few things in your favor would be happening: 1) You would be actively showing (and documenting) that you are looking to do everything in your power to improve your classroom. 2) You would be engaging the admin in that process and asking them to keep up their end of the ""support"" they promised you. 3) Most importantly, it sounds like your class would benefit from some positive culture building and incentives (based on the anecdotes you shared from current interactions with students).

highschoolteachers,"First, I do not think it makes you an ""awful"" teacher. However, I think 4 weeks is *far* too long for a writing assignment grade, yes. A rule of thumb is one assignment should be returned in advance of the next writing assignment in time for the student to see errors and make growth. This could be anywhere from 2 days to a week before, depending on length of assignment, needs of students, etc. A week before is ideal, but I know in AP English, we had short essays due weekly so that is obviously impossible. I also never had teachers who took more than a week to get me a writing assignment back (the end of the semester? Even before electronic grades, I would have been bothering my AP teacher every day if that happened to me in high school -- grades are important in high school; they are your future if you want to go to college because that is the system we have; the types of kids you are lucky enough to teach know that). Second, I am unclear why you are working 50-55 hours on stuff besides grading with the population you have and prescribed curriculum you have. If pacing and curriculum are there for you and you have engaged learners who CARE about grades, the prep time should not be that long for lessons, assuming you get adequate prep (5 hours or so built into your 40ish-hour contract) per week and are then working 10-15 hours *on top* of that already? Prep is where you should have it easy, as well as classroom management and engagement. The students are engaged via grades (which is many a teacher's dream, ironically, but which you dislike -- I could go either way; I am a pragmatist and I say ""Whatever works""). Additional engagement helps and is best practice, but if the school/kids/parents prioritize grading and feedback, so should you. Maybe sometimes let the other things slide and grade during your prep period instead? Maybe strike a better balance? You make it sound like you never grade writing during your prep. Why not? Also, I would focus more on grading things like Writing than participation/HW - though the latter may be easier already and not take much time away, I am sure it adds up, no? Finally, if your rubric is clear, then I would think you could easily defend your grading decisions, but I am not sure if you are using a rubric that is unclear and prescribed for you. Perhaps that could be fixed if the rubric is the issue? You could collect papers for an anchor set for yourself and your students (for next year at least, if you have none from last year) and that may help long-term. You could also find another teaching assignment with a different set of kids who are not as grade-motivated where the rigor is not as high and the grading is not as massive. In those placements, classroom management and designing engaging lessons would be the primary challenges vs. grading and nitpicking by parents.",first think make awful teacher however think week far long writing assignment grade yes rule thumb one assignment returned advance next writing assignment time student see error make growth could anywhere day week depending length assignment need student etc week ideal know ap english short essay due weekly obviously impossible also never teacher took week get writing assignment back end semester even electronic grade would bothering ap teacher every day happened grade important future want go college system type kid lucky enough teach know second unclear working hour stuff besides grading population prescribed curriculum pacing curriculum engaged learner care grade prep time long lesson assuming get adequate prep hour built ish hour contract per week working hour top already prep easy well classroom management engagement student engaged via grade many teacher dream ironically dislike could go either way pragmatist say whatever work additional engagement help best practice kid parent prioritize grading feedback maybe sometimes let thing slide grade prep period instead maybe strike better balance make sound like never grade writing prep also would focus grading thing like writing participation he though latter may easier already take much time away sure add finally rubric clear would think could easily defend grading decision sure using rubric unclear prescribed perhaps could fixed rubric issue could collect paper anchor set student next year least none last year may help long term could also find another teaching assignment different set kid grade motivated rigor grading massive placement classroom management designing engaging lesson would primary challenge i grading nitpicking parent

I would think a lot of that is not necessarily specific to gifted, as you mentioned before, in determining her level of reading, etc. But as far as specific gifted testing, we use the Cognitive Abilities Test (all sections), the Naglieri nonverbal, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, and generally the Stanford 10 achievement test.

highschoolteachers,"In elementary, especially in the younger grades, you are very much in a parent role a lot of the time: making sure they eat healthy snacks, helping out with stuck zippers, untying knots, resolving friendship problems, etc. Coming directly from high school or middle school that was frustrating to me at first, but now that I understand the needs of younger children better and have adjusted my exoectations, it is a part of the job that I enjoy. Younger kids from K-Grade 5 do not give any of the attitude of older students. They buy in to whatever lessons you have planned 110% and they really like their teachers. It is a lot of fun and you see a lot of growth in a year, which is incredibly satisfying. The lower the grade you teach, the more growth and change you tend to see in a year. For me personally, the best age is 8-10 year olds. They are can do a lot on their own, yet they are still very keen to learn and are interested in school. I have not taught as much high school (just during my teaching practicum), but I found that it was very much more subject-focussed so planning is much, much easier. Marking also seemed easier (though English might be heavy), since marks are based using a percentage system instead of the holistic approach used (rightly) in elementary. Middle school is my idea of hell -- the worst of both worlds.

highschoolteachers,"Former juvenile detention teacher here. I sincerely loved many of my students but some were just downright scary and I would not have wanted to be in the classroom without guards present. If a student is threatening your life, take it seriously! He/she might just be posturing, but why take a chance? Some of these kids are mentally ill and not getting the proper treatment and some are just pissed off at the world and looking for any opportunity to let off some aggression. Some honestly want to do real prison time to earn respect from their peers. I would shudder at the thought of some of the kids I dealt with being sent back to ""real"" classrooms! But they were. Not all, but definitely some would not be in school at all if it was not part of probation and he/she was not wearing a monitor. I also subbed regularly at a public high school and heard that MANY times (usually as the excuse for why they refused to do any work). My point is, just because they are legally still children does not mean they cannot do very serious damage--up to and including actual murder. We had one seemingly NICE kid who was in for attempted murder. He followed a woman home and then attacked her on her doorstep with a knife, ""just to see what it would feel like to kill somebody. "" Fortunately she survived and he will be locked up for a little while, but not long enough, i am going to! My suggestion would be to document the incident in writing, present it to an administrator and if they do not take of it in a timely and appropriate manner, take it to your union. Also, ask the student who his probation officer is and see if that does not make him stop and think for a moment!

highschoolteachers,"Long Reply. So I will start with parent advice first, then move to academic support advice. Background, my son was a non-reader in the third grade, and it made every subject hard for him. Additionally, he was so humiliated that he felt stupid that he was beginning to just refuse to do work. He eventually became a reader, now really enjoys it. I now teach high school and see 1st hand the emotional toll being illiterate has on an adolescent. Mom needs to realize that he needs strong love and support, first and foremost. He is likely very self aware and just tired of feeling like a failure. For a 6th grader, I would probably try graphic novels (comic books) because reading is reading. Graphic novels have fewer words and provide images that help the student understand the content. Additionally, reading to mom is a good thing, but she is not a reading specialist, so he may have other reading issues that ""practice"" cannot fix. But she should let him read things to her that he wants to. It is hard to be interested in the things that 12 year old boys like, but he needs to read, and if he wants to read you the ""silly"" part of what just read, let him. Help him with his homework. Have him help her cook and read the recipe to her. Teach him how to Google on mom's smartphone and have him look things up for her when she is ""busy"". Get him anything that he is interested in reading: Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Comic Books, Video Game review books, Minecraft tutorial books, ANYTHING. Big point here - Make sure he knows that as long as he is trying, she is not concerned about his grades. She just needs him doing his part at school and attempting, because he is SMART, SMART, SMART!! Kids need to know that their parents truly believe they can succeed! Now for school...It is said, throughout education, that in the early grades (Kinder - 3rd) students are ""Learning to Read"", beyond that they are ""Reading to Learn"", so now, the lack of reading is impacting every other subject. Even if he does not like his math teacher, the reading is also impacting his ability to do math. If you are in the US your friend should request that her son be evaluated for a learning disability. If it is determined that there is a disability, then the student should be able to receive reading intervention service and other types of assistance to help him ""get"" the content. Mom should talk to her son honestly about being evaluated, tell him to do his best and try not to give up so they can figure out how to best help him. Mom is his first teacher, and his #1 advocate. Not knowing what his elementary experience has been, I cannot criticize the teaching, and kids get really good at hiding their non-reading...like CRAZY GOOD, but it sounds like he got left behind somewhere and that is not his fault! Mom just needs to realize that she is in it for the next 6-7 years to get him graduated, so she needs to be prepared to be the one consistent voice of advocacy that he has. Teachers have 30 - 120 kinds or more to follow daily, Mom has 1.

In fact, in Secondary Education, I find that content area knowledge is very rarely the area that teachers are lacking (and I have mentored teachers in every subject area) compared to their abilities to manage classrooms or motivate students. Additionally, motivated teachers can often teach themselves content area knowledge if needed with the resources available. &gt;If they have a master's in their subject area, that is basically a guarantee that they are comfortable with high school level calculus/algebra/physics/chemistry/biology. I have not found those with Masters degrees (though, to be fair, I have met very few teachers with pure content STEM degrees or pure content anything else degrees) have a higher degree of content knowledge or that STEM teachers typically struggle with their content knowledge. I have not found this to be a high area of need. In fact, Science and Math departments seem to hire people with very high degrees of subject knowledge where I am.

highschoolteachers,"Gosh, I am sorry to hear you are having a miserable time at it. I have to tell you, if you are in a toxic work environment anywhere (education, healthcare, engineering, etc.), you are going to feel the exact way. I know, I have been in horrible working situations and absolutely wanted to give up. Have you thought about a district change? Many of my teacher friends stress a lot of your satisfaction has to do with the district, which I know is not always something you can choose when looking for work. If you are holding out until the end of the year, you absolutely have time to start applying, though! That said, as a taxpayer - thank you for working in a less than great school district. Those kids need good teachers, even if many of them act like monsters. Teachers are some of the most unappreciated group of workers in the country for the work they do and are unfairly blamed for a failing education system. I absolutely despise standardized tests (I was an anxious, severely depressed high schooler) and think it is outrageous teachers are evaluated on them. I was just about give up on dreams of college due to my lower than expected ACT and SAT scores until my English teacher gave me the confidence to retake it and continue on. I think if I even helped one kid in my entire career the way I was helped, it would be worth it. I completely understand and have heard many stories from current coworkers who just burnt out and could not handle it anymore, especially the administration side of education. That said, I am making an okay salary for my background and education but working about 10 to 12 hour days plus weekends (like you said - the work is never done) with little chance of upward mobility; I am just not cut out for corporate greed and what it takes to get to the top. The only thing at the moment that is giving me hope that I will not become another cog in the corporate machine is teaching someday.",gosh sorry hear miserable time tell toxic work environment anywhere education healthcare engineering etc going feel exact way know horrible working situation absolutely wanted give thought district change many teacher friend stress lot satisfaction district know always something choose looking work holding end year absolutely time start applying though said taxpayer thank working le great district kid need good teacher even many act like monster teacher unappreciated group worker country work unfairly blamed failing education system absolutely despise standardized test anxious severely depressed schooler think outrageous teacher evaluated give dream college due lower expected act sat score english teacher gave confidence retake continue think even helped one kid entire career way helped would worth completely understand heard many story current coworkers burnt could handle anymore especially administration side education said making okay salary background education working hour day plus weekend like said work never done little chance upward mobility cut corporate greed take get top thing moment giving hope become another cog corporate machine teaching someday
highschoolteachers,"&gt;So you think ELA content is immaterial and easier to teach? That is defensive and accusatory. No, I said nothing of the sort. The fact you feel content-area master's do not matter is a bit puzzling to me. I ascribed it to the fact that maybe your teaching ELA made your experience different from mine and that of many other teachers I know; I realized they are mostly STEM. You have many people teaching science and math that do not really know it that well, maybe barely skated by in their undergraduate degree. That is a fact.

highschoolteachers,"While all I have to go on is what you tell us, I think part of your decision is ""right."" If you are working in a charter, it is odd that you are told you are ""on your own."" Charters typically have an exorbitant amount of procedures for students and teachers to follow, which theoretically is why they are relatively successful with the population we work with. I work is a public high school very similar to your population. The fights you are describing, if all by the same student, are certainly not your fault. That student should have been expelled already, as charter schools are a privilege, so to speak. Even in a standard public school, that child would been expelled at that point. It seems you are in a really bad school with poor leadership, in an already tough district. The only reason I made it through my first year at my tough spot was because of the guidance and support of my leadership. I would not leave the field entirely. I would try again somewhere fresh, or sub for a bit (although I presume subbing is one of the toughest jobs really). You have a point about not leaving mid year because it leaves a bad impression. Is there someone you trust and look up to in your school who is familiar with all the specifics that you can go to for advice? I certainly hope so. Or maybe see a therapist who has experience speaking with people in the teaching profession. My therapist used to teach in my exact position in my district for like 20 years before changing careers, and I stumbled across her all accidentally. She is the greatest and totally gets me and my stressors. Best of luck. PM me if you want to talk or ask me questions. Again, I work in one of the toughest districts too.

highschoolteachers,"I do not know what the answer is. I was just like you when I was in high school, and that is the reason why I wasted 5 years trying to become a teacher. Now that I have started, I wish I had done something else with my education. As a teacher, these problems continue to exist, and now I 100% understand why your teachers just go through the motions the way that they do. You can try talking to your teachers about it, but I cannot guarantee it will be successful. Part of the problem is the workload of teachers. People like me wanted to go in to make a change, but guess what? Your evaluations as a teacher are based on performance on standardized tests. Teaching to the test is not an effective way of fostering learning, but when your job depends on it, people do it.

highschoolteachers,"I will be student teaching starting in January I have an Electrical Eng. degree which I never used in the field (other than a little IT work that did not really use what I learned). I fell into doing remodeling and carpentry for the last 6-7 years. I enjoyed myself and mastering different skills was very satisfying but my source of work is retiring and I have no desire to run my own business. Also I would like to use the degree I spent all that time and money on. I have been back at school part and recently full time for several years. It has been a challenge to keep up with school, home life, and working to pay the bills. I have a 2 year old and another kid on the way. I am in my mid 30s so I know a bit about changing careers. I would say your level of challenge with the transition will greatly depend on what else is going on with your life. I cannot speak to the actual having a job part (though my mother taught elementary, my father was a college football coach and he taught kinesiology, and I have several friends who are public school teachers, so I at least hear plenty of ""are you sure you know what you are doing"" speeches along with the ""it was so great when"" stories.) If you really have a passion for teaching, you will enjoy methods classes and theories of learning. You will probably have to take some psych classes related to child development, special Ed, etc. Degree requirements can be very different from the cert requirements, but I am sure you know how to explore that. I would also echo the ""get into a classroom"" sentiment. You said you plan to already but I would add that you want to go outside your comfort zone as much as possible. Try to observe grade levels you never thought you would want to teach. I went into all of this with a few bad experiences with younger kids at summer camps and such. Meanwhile I had great experiences with high school kids in other situations, so I pictured myself as a HS teacher. Fast forward to now and I have spent nearly 100 hours in middle school classrooms and it is completely different than I imagined (in a good way). Take every opportunity to work with kids in different situations. 1 on 1, small groups, etc. As the others mentioned, the classroom is totally different than a tour. Make sure to observe how things change during the day (before vs after lunch, etc) and during the week (Monday vs Friday), and if you can, get some context with the whole year. If you observe the week before Thanksgiving it is a lot different than if you are in a room in September or March. Speaking of those 100 hours I mentioned, they were a requirement of my program. We got 60 in two chunks from classes and were responsible for 40 on our own. So, make sure you get some sort of proof/signature/etc that you were in a classroom and working with age appropriate kids. It might save you a ton of time later. Anyway, the biggest difference between a museum tour and a classroom is that TEACHING IS NOT TELLING. You feel good about all the stuff you said after a tour. Some students probably ask interesting questions, so you think that means they are learning. Nope. Not necessarily. Maybe that one kid did but maybe they have a misconception as well. The hardest thing to do is to find and create lessons that allow the students to construct their own knowledge. You will be managing and shaping HOW they do that. To relate it to museums again, the kids probably learn more from well designed exhibits than they do from you talking. Reading, touching things, making their own connections...relating what they know to what you want them to explore...that is where it happens. Anyway you may know some of that already and I did not mean to sound harsh at the end there. Just figured I would point out some common misconceptions people have about classrooms that come from their own experiences. Because we all have lots of experience with lecture and similar situations, we sometimes mistake that for being responsible for learning.",student teaching starting january electrical eng degree never used field little work really use learned fell remodeling carpentry last year enjoyed mastering different skill satisfying source work retiring desire run business also would like use degree spent time money back part recently full time several year challenge keep home life working pay bill year old another kid way mid know bit changing career would say level challenge transition greatly depend else going life cannot speak actual job part though mother taught father college football coach taught kinesiology several friend public teacher least hear plenty sure know speech along great story really passion teaching enjoy method class theory learning probably take psych class related child development special ed etc degree requirement different cert requirement sure know explore would also echo get classroom sentiment said plan already would add want go outside comfort zone much possible try observe grade level never thought would want teach went bad experience younger kid summer camp meanwhile great experience kid situation pictured i teacher fast forward spent nearly hour classroom completely different imagined good way take every opportunity work kid different situation small group etc others mentioned classroom totally different tour make sure observe thing change day i lunch etc week monday i friday get context whole year observe week thanksgiving lot different room september march speaking hour mentioned requirement program got two chunk class responsible make sure get sort proof signature etc classroom working age appropriate kid might save ton time later anyway biggest difference museum tour classroom teaching telling feel good stuff said tour student probably ask interesting question think mean learning nope necessarily maybe one kid maybe misconception well hardest thing find create lesson allow student construct knowledge managing shaping relate museum kid probably learn well designed exhibit talking reading touching thing making connection relating know want explore happens anyway may know already mean sound harsh end figured would point common misconception people classroom come experience lot experience lecture similar situation sometimes mistake responsible learning
highschoolteachers,"I got one. So it is my second or third year teaching. I am in ESL, so I do not often get to go on field trips. They are rare in the first place so when someone asks me to go, I go. I will preface with most of my students are refugees. So they are coming from multiple countries and I do not speak, say, Burundi all that well. So we have to get creative with instructions. A lot of miming and pictures and other scaffolds. After a little over a year, they have the basic vocabulary down to have the workings of a conversation. So we had a deal for a couple years where each grade was able to take a trip to the zoo during the off season. It was one of those deals where they have a couple lessons, pet the iguana, dissect the owl turd, etc. Everything is going well until they bring out the big, hairy spider. Personally, I am alright with snakes and most bugs. But spiders are freaky deaky. They have hair and spit and move their bodies with their heart, that is a big old ball of nope for me. I am not afraid and I get the spiders out of the house for my wife all the time, but I are not touching them either. So I check on all my newcomer kids and do my best miming technique of ""Touch? No touch? Thumbs up thumbs down. Okay, no touch."" So I took care of that. Now what I should have done is checked on this kid who had been in the states almost two years. This kid was pretty bright, had a good deal of basic English before he came, the schools in his host country were pretty solid, and he was doing well with us. So I thought at least ""Spider? No, thank you."" was in his repertoire. Well, he got the idea across when flung that big, hair spider straight up in the air. Pan. De. Monium. Kids are running everywhere, jumping on top of tables, screaming, chairs flying, no one knows where the spider is. Just... wow. And these are sixth graders. One or two of them have already had their growth spurt and are, like, already 180 lbs. So there was a lot of big movement quickly. I am not helping. The problem for me was not the spider. It was the fact that, despite having a number of advanced degree, I never really graduated from being a high school sophomore. I am turning red with laughter. I am crying and dry heaving it was so funny. It was just too much. After like 30 seconds (a really long 30 seconds), I collect myself and help get the kids to calm down, help find the spider (who luckily had not had a little spider heart attack or was stepped on), and get the room back in order. After that, I suggested we move straight to the tour. So to this day I swear that kids half did that on purpose. Who throws a spider straight up in the air? It is going to come back down, and probably on you. And at this point that kid had the faculties to say ""No."" I asked him that day and a couple of times a few years after, ""What in the world were you thinking?"" I get the same answer every time ""I do not know"" and then he giggles. That kid knew.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;Since when does a percentage outweigh student understanding? Since society has decided (incorrectly) that they are the same thing basically and assigned a host of consequences to students, teachers, and schools to get those numbers where they want them, all while falling behind. I do not know how you fix this. I know I have my little ways of rebellion, as a teacher, but they are small. Tiny. Insignificant. They will not really *change* anything. And, at the end of the day, I will still be judged on those percentages. Since I teach middle school, I can protect my kids somewhat from the mentality but not entirely. In high school, I am sure that becomes impossible. What can a student do? Nothing, just you one. But if you could make other students your age understand the issue, truly understand it, then maybe we could get somewhere. It would take time, a movement for systemic change. I do not know how that happens. I think in the meantime all we have are small islands of shelter and refuge in the numerical sea.",it since percentage outweigh student understanding since society decided incorrectly thing basically assigned host consequence student teacher school get number want falling behind know fix know little way rebellion teacher small tiny insignificant really change anything end day still judged percentage since teach protect kid somewhat mentality entirely sure becomes impossible student nothing one could make student age understand issue truly understand maybe could get somewhere would take time movement systemic change know happens think meantime small island shelter refuge numerical sea

highschoolteachers,"Thanks for the input! Absolutely agree with you - museum tours are completely different than teaching. I have, however, noticed in each of my professional positions and in college, I gravitate towards education and curriculum development. I excel best when working with and teaching others, and I do think teaching is the career path for me. I have time scheduled to shadow at a local high school and have heard plenty of horror stories from friends of not being able to find a teaching position/stuck subbing. I believe I have a bit of an advantage as I bring real world experience and also have a resume that displays a professional career already. Worst case scenario, I would not be as hard pressed to find a position to support myself with my professional background. Hopefully it would not come to that, though. From my research I have came to the conclusion social studies and language arts are pretty saturated fields, but I have also read plenty that having endorsements for both would give a leg up. I could also easily obtain endorsements for journalism and anthropology, although from what I have seen, there has not been a high school to offer anthropology as an elective.

In the past, I have not even written cards - when I was teaching 50+ graduating Year 12s the idea was overwhelming.

highschoolteachers,This seems to be a perpetual statement that the education system is broken that students are getting a raw deal and teachers are treated as martyrs in a world where the almighty dollar rings. ( you are going to have to interpret my talk-to-text because this is too much to type on mobile) I fell into teaching I earned a journalism degree from State University in Texas and ended up taking a job as an aid while I was looking for jobs as a News writer and fell in love with the classroom and working with students. It was a special education classroom and I have two women who were extremely conservative and religious who had been there for years one of them was there for at least 30 and they were handing out these incredibly thick packet of worksheets to the special education students who ranged in age from kindergarten to sixth grade and it was mind-numbingly silent in that classroom always one of them was constantly on her email she was the primary teacher and looking to retire in the next couple of years pretty much just riding the wave the other was another age and had a daughter in fifth grade at the school they were from Oklahoma the husband work at Verizon. I am not really worried about giving too many specifics because there is no way that they use Reddit. One day one of our students who was the 6th grader was on the computer and totally sucked into something interesting and he was looking up ancient Egypt and the Pharaohs. I decided to join him and we spent at least half an hour looking up different websites and talking about the history of the kingdom and so many things Way Beyond what any other 6th grader would be interested in and the other is that I work with said to him quote okay it is time to get back to work now. I almost lost it. I told her he was working comma he was doing more work than she had given him in months. And her response was I need something to grade. I was so taken aback that I did not even respond. I just thought to myself I cannot let people like this teach our children. And I became a full-time teacher and got my own classroom and I have been teaching for 7 years. The pay is good the benefits are good I have more time off than any of my friends have plenty of autonomy in my classroom to teach what I want how I want and fortunately I teach electives in high school so I am strictly evaluated based on my students performance and what they produce I think a lot of core teachers have a hard time being able to push back on administrators and District Personnel because their product is a standardized test. If they took a more project-based learning approach and have something outside of the test to say okay this student did not perform well on a standardized test but look at what they are able to create then I think you would see a shift the problem that I see primarily an education is to many employees who either feel they have it tough or just clock in and out and do not realize what they are actually doing for a career at this is not a job in a cubicle where you process 8 hours worth of data and go home to your family. It does not work like that you have to understand what you are getting into before you become a teacher. I see a lot of people who want to change careers and leave teaching I feel lot of people who want to change careers and become teachers and most are doing it for the wrong reasons I think that you do not need to see teaching as a calling to be a natural for it but you have to have a passion for Learning and teaching and sharing and be open and flexible and if you do that you will be successful butt it is a business just like everything else and there are politics and there are people that want you to do less with more. Personally I drive because I am brace that Underdog mentality teach my children to do less with more and we constantly come out on top because of that are advertising for the yearbook is funny and cheap and cheesy and we take a cue from Adult Swim in in that and our book is geared towards what students want which is lots of really good photos that they can take because they do not have the skills instead of trying to win contests our newspaper is driven by the students ideas not by what the teacher or the administrators want them to do and we went to work because of it because we do our thing and we create community and culture I see a lot of people that complain that are not happy with their situation as teachers it is tough especially if you have administrator that do not like you but Enclave for me easier than any other job stability was consistency.

I see a lot of people who want to change careers and leave teaching I see a lot of people who want to change careers and become teachers and most are doing it for the wrong reasons I think that you do not need to see teaching as a calling to be a natural for it but you have to have a passion for learning and teaching and sharing and be open and flexible and if you do that you will be successful but its a business just like anything else in there are politics and there people that want you to do let us with more. Personally I Drive because I am brace that underdog mentality I teach my children to do less with more and we constantly come out on top because of that our advertising for the yearbook is funny and cheap and cheesy and we take a cue from adults Swim in in that and our book is geared towards with students want which is lot of really good photos that they can take because they do not have the skills instead of trying to win contest our newspaper is driven by the students ID is not by what the teacher or the administrators want them to do and we went to warrants because of it because we do our thing and we create community and culture I feel lot to people that can plan that are not happy with their situation is teachers its tough especially if you have administrators that do not like you but on flights for me easier than any other job stability wise consistency my just deal with teenagers I deal with on train done educated people like so...

highschoolteachers,"Story time! So, I have a friend who was in a very similar position to you. She was a very talented musician, but also excelled in math and sciences in school. Her family was really encouraging her to go into engineering, and she almost did, but at the last minute she switched to music. She is now a very successful conductor, composer, and soloist. And she is really happy that she did not do engineering. ___ Now for a personal story. I am pretty sure that I want to be a teacher. I have known that since I was in high school. But I let my family (and my own high school teachers) convince me to try engineering, so now I am a computer engineer. It is okay, but I am not the happiest, and I am planning to go back and get my teaching degree soon. ___ Basically my point is that you know yourself best- what do you think would be the best thing for *you*? I would recommend keeping your options open at least in your first year of college if that is possible. Computer science experience is never a bad thing, and if you enjoy it then it can be a great career. But if being a band director is your dream, then go for it!

I will graduate over ten years after finishing high school, but the time I have spent volunteering and observing in classrooms has been priceless and a confirmation that in the end I made the right choice. That said, if you want my advice, spend your first year at college (assuming you are in the US or a country with a similar university system) taking generals and classes from majors you are interested in, including some education pre-reqs. Talk to your university's academic counseling center, chat with professors in fields you are interested in, and do not make a decision right away.

highschoolteachers,"I am still young and ignorant, but I subbed for a special-ed job last year that blew my mind. It was a job ""teaching"" (babysitting) extreme behavioral issues high school students who cannot function in the typical classroom due to both grades and violent tendencies. Most all of them had some sort of social worker that visited every month or so. The thing that blew my mind was how ridiculous the system was set up. The kids were in a separate building away from their peers, and they were to spend their entire 6-7 hr day in the same room (only leaving for lunch). Each kid had their own individual state mandated test book to work on that would get them their missing credit from the classes they had previously failed. It was an actual book, so it was supposed to take the entire year to complete. I was basically expected to teach 6 different subjects to 10 students at the same time. It felt like prison. I covered it for several days and could slowly feel myself going insane just from the time consuming monotony. I could not imagine how the kids felt having to sit there each day. The job did not even require teaching; it was not like I was standing up there leading them through a lesson. It was literally just ""make sure the kids are working on their book"". I guess my question would be ""Are you seriously just keeping this program on its bare bones just so you can increase attendance numbers?"". Or ""Can we not afford to get these kids some more aides to work with them?

highschoolteachers,"The AP US History test was yesterday morning. It is set by the College Board and individual schools do not get to change it. Again, information missing here - but unless your daughter's school has a crazy schedule where 6th period is in the morning, she should have been able to go and get help. It is tough as a parent to balance the fact that your child is almost an adult, with the fact that she is not an adult yet and still needs mom and dad. I think that your next step might be deciding whether this is an area you want her to try out her ""adult wings"", and take care of business for herself, or where you need to step in as a parent and help guide her. If you choose option 2, then I would call the pre-Calc teacher and set up a meeting between yourself, your daughter, and the Pre-Calc and AP Stats teachers. The purpose of this meeting would be to find out exactly what the situation is: Why is she starting an AP Stats class at the end of the year? Was this optional? Who is responsible for teaching the content? What are the expectations for your daughter? Is she taking advantage of all opportunities to learn? How exactly will the grades work? That kind of thing. You are on the same team, the goal is your daughter's success. As a high school teacher, I want to see my students be successful. I love that they are involved in many activities, and I do my best to support them in that. However, I have students who have to miss class a LOT due to these activities. I make myself available to them before school, after school, homeroom (when they are not gone for those activities anyway), during my planning period, etc and very few of them take me up on it. They do not enjoy that they have to take tests/quizzes like everyone else, and think that it is not fair because they were gone. (I am reasonable with this - I do not make them take it at the same time if they have missed the past 3 days of school and did not have the opportunity to learn everything). I cannot help that they were gone. I cannot give them an A simply because they are good kids. I make sure they have opportunities to come in and learn before they take the test. Our choices have consequences, and we have to live with them. If it is important to me to have an A, I will get up and get myself to school early to get help, stay after school, or find some other way to get what I need in order to be successful.

highschoolteachers,"First time posting here and I have been wanting to say everything about my experience as a sub teacher for over a year so far: -In my first year of sub teaching, I thought I was going to like high school and wanted to become an art teacher, but I realized that I enjoyed elementary, realizing that teaching more than one subject to little people and varying degrees of kids (K-2 and SPED) is more refreshing and exciting. -The last straw for me subbing at a high school was a HS Resource class that had some of the most obnoxious and rude students (with exception to this inspiring artist who showed me his cool drawings), I cancelled my week-long HS assignment and went into a 4th grade class that had subs for weeks with no explanation on why the current teacher was present. Although challenging, it was a fresh take on teaching (for me). -There is this principal that is apparently herald as a caring, going-over-her way type. She was not like that to me not one bit. Even telling her that I was just a first-year sub and for me to stop the math lesson because it was too complicated to understand or teach (Engage N.Y., do not like it), she ended up ragging on me and just saw me with in a negative light rather than being supportive and critical at what ""I could have done"" professionally. I told her that I was interested in SPED, but insisted that I wanted to do it because it was easy to get a job, seeing I wanted to do it for the money. She had an assembly with the 5th graders basically bitching about their behavior and stuff like graffiti in the bathroom, but here is the kicker: she offered students to come up and dig up some names so they can take them out to a well-known local burger joint (I am not sure if that is appropriate, or professional). She also chewed me out on whether I can do a good job or teach at all, according to a student who overheard a conversation from her and another teacher while we passed her in the hallway, walking back to class. I never went back to that school. -My next year consisted of 2 long term assignments with some of the most supportive classes/people I have ever felt in the room. Although I was the sub teacher and with a 1:1 ratio of student:para, it felt positive and exciting to be in those classes. It gave a positive outlook in becoming a SPED teacher and the inner workings of it. -Roving sub positions vary from being easygoing and having lots of breaks to horribly rough. -Will not/almost never sub at a middle school. Heard enough bad experiences from other subs and just my bad experience as a student. -If you write lesson plans for a sub for your K class, do not write 2 paragraphs about a math lesson. Just tell me simple things and I will execute them the best I can. In general, unless it is about behavior, 7 pages of sub plans may be a bit too much in 12-point font.",first time posting wanting say everything experience sub teacher year far first year sub teaching thought going like wanted become art teacher realized enjoyed realizing teaching one subject little people varying degree kid i sped refreshing exciting last straw subbing i resource class obnoxious rude student exception inspiring artist showed cool drawing cancelled week long i assignment went the grade class sub week explanation current teacher present although challenging fresh take teaching principal apparently herald caring going way type like one bit even telling first year sub stop math lesson complicated understand teach engage i like ended ragging saw negative light rather supportive critical could done professionally told interested sped insisted wanted easy get job seeing wanted money assembly the grader basically bitching behavior stuff like graffiti bathroom kicker offered student come dig name take well known local burger joint sure appropriate professional also chewed whether good job teach according student overheard conversation another teacher passed hallway walking back class never went back next year consisted long term assignment supportive class people ever felt room although sub teacher ratio student para felt positive exciting class gave positive outlook becoming sped teacher inner working roving sub position vary easygoing lot break horribly rough almost never sub heard enough bad experience sub bad experience student write lesson plan sub i class write paragraph math lesson tell simple thing execute best general unless behavior page sub plan may bit much point font

highschoolteachers,"I will not have a job to move there with, nor a degree so my options are limited. That being said, we will have about $100k in cash to purchase a piece of land around $30k-40k, and build a tiny house with rain catchment and solar at around $40k. That would still leave us with about $20k-$25k as an emergency fund. We lived on Oahu for two years after high school, so I am well aware of the cost of living in Hawaii. Living on the big island can be done very cheaply if you think outside the box and live modestly. If you look at the pay scale steps, as a 3rd year teacher my wife would be earning about $43k-$45k a year, I believe. If you have no mortgage or car payment, that is plenty of money to live more than comfortably. After taxes and insurance, take home would be about $3k a month. Car insurance, gas, food, student loans and other necessary expenses will not be even close to $3k. We are trying to figure out how to pay off the student loans before moving too, and if that works out, we will be more than fine.

highschoolteachers,"This is one of those topics I tend to rant about with my friends. I graduated in December after doing my student teaching during the fall semester. One of the required classes at my university was ""Education Technology"" and was taught by a ~50 year old woman (this is relevant, I promise). In her mind, and in the mind of the many guest speakers, anyone under the age of ~30 was ""tech native"" having grown up with something with a microchip in it. The entire class, unfortunately, was basically playing with iPad apps. Pretty much every single one of my classmates agrees that it was, by a wide margin, the worst class we took in our education program. It might have been relevant for teachers like my mother, who retired about 4 years ago after 30 years in, primarily, a 5th grade classroom and who has a decent working understanding of a pc but little more. The thing is, compared to these teachers, my professor and my mother, the high school freshmen I taught during my student teaching **were** ""tech native"". But compared to myself and my student teaching peers, they were just absolutely terrible on computers. They knew mobile tech like their cell phones and tablets as well as anyone, but they did not know simple non-mobile tech things like, as /you/eman14 said, how to operate windows, manage files, work Microsoft office, or even how to type. My students were so far from being ""tech native"" as to be hilarious. They were mobile-tech native at best. Just as a point of comparison, I can remember taking very basic typing classes starting in about 3rd grade. My elementary school had a library computer lab that had about 25 or 30 first generation iMacs in it that we would go to every couple of weeks to do basic typing exercises and play typing games. By junior high, we were taking dedicated computer classes that included being able to type at least 60 wpm with a plastic thing blocking our view of the keyboard. One of my fellow student teachers last fall taught a couple sections of computer apps 1, which focused on the Microsoft Office suite of programs. However, they usually had to wait at least a month into the semester to even start on Word because they had to teach the students how to type because almost none of them had had a class that covered that skill prior to reaching high school. The district I was in was not rich but it was not poor either. Basically, what I am trying to say is that I personally think the single biggest issue with technology in the classroom right now is that to those in the halls of power (administration, school boards, state education committees), technology is technology. They do not, perhaps even cannot, distinguish between technology that is primarily about entertainment (iPads, cell phone apps) and technology that is about something more ""productive"" like PCs. To them, the student who grew up having their own cell phone since they were 10 is the same as the, now, young teacher who grew up communicating with friends over instant messenger programs. And we seem to have left a generation behind as a result.",one topic tend rant friend graduated december student teaching fall semester one required class university education technology taught year old woman relevant promise mind mind many guest speaker anyone age tech native grown something microchip entire class unfortunately basically playing ipad apps pretty much every single one classmate agrees wide margin worst class took education program might relevant teacher like mother retired year ago year primarily the grade classroom decent working understanding pa little thing compared teacher professor mother freshman taught student teaching tech native compared student teaching peer absolutely terrible computer knew mobile tech like cell phone tablet well anyone know simple non mobile tech thing like man said operate window manage file work microsoft office even type student far tech native hilarious mobile tech native best point comparison remember taking basic typing class starting red grade library computer lab first generation imac would go every couple week basic typing exercise play typing game junior taking dedicated computer class included able type least wom plastic thing blocking view keyboard one fellow student teacher last fall taught couple section computer apps focused microsoft office suite program however usually wait least month semester even start word teach student type almost none class covered skill prior reaching district rich poor either basically trying say personally think single biggest issue technology classroom right hall power administration board state education committee technology technology perhaps even cannot distinguish technology primarily entertainment ipads cell phone apps technology something productive like pa student grew cell phone since young teacher grew communicating friend instant messenger program seem left generation behind result

highschoolteachers,"I love teaching middle school. I taught high school initially and did not care for it. Think of it this way, middle school students (grades 6-8) are old enough to take care of themselves but young enough to still need and want guidance. They are a perfect middle ground, in my opinion. I have been teaching middle school for seven years, and there is never a dull moment. This is a great time to get into the teaching profession in certain states. For example I am teaching in Southern California and there is such a shortage of teachers that we are recruiting from the east coast. Meaning that many districts are hiring teacher candidates who are still in their teaching credential programs, as intern teachers.

highschoolteachers,"Not really any consequences no. The only thing I can think is when you get to 9th grade and want to take higher level classes.

K-8 was just building your knowledge bank, your social skills and your logic/reasoning skills. Not to mention reading and writing, but I digress. 9th grade is to make most of that tumble like a tent in a tornado. 10th grade is the rebound. 11th grade is when you start realizing your grades are not good enough for Harvard. 12th grade is when you realize the true meaning of the word ""anxiety"".

Shut it down. Some teachers deal with this by prescribing a certain time to talk about these things...if the students really care. Usually the first 5-10 minutes on a Friday or Monday. Take your pick. I usually like to waste a little time on a Monday because...well...let us face it--it is Monday. Not EVERY Monday, but quite often they will have silly questions they want to ask. Figure out where your line is and do not cross it. Some teachers like to share everything. Others like to share nothing. I am in between. I will share my experiences (like what I did for a break or a long weekend as long as it is appropriate), but I do not like to talk about dating, college life, etc. If admin. walks through and they hear a kid remark about ""Mr. so and so knows how to play beer pong"" it sounds fishy. Now I will say that *drinking* is not necessarily bad to talk about. I do talk about it, but it is always in a social atmosphere. ""I went drinking with a couple friends."" The first time a student makes a remark about it I say something along the lines of ""I am older than 21 and I always do so responsibly. I hope you do not have to learn the hard way to do the same when you get to that age."" Then again I would not make any remarks to certain levels of students.

The MTLD who was supposed to be supporting me was in my classroom maybe a total of 4 times during my first year of teaching and no more than 2 times during my second year of teaching. I had to rely on veteran teachers at my school and read a lot of stuff on the internet and ask questions of anyone I possibly could. Though TFA promised all of this support and help and guidance, I received none of it. That being said: Like you, I majored in English, not education.

I can look back to high school, middle school and college and think of plenty of constructivist activities I participated in which were downright fucking useless. I can also think back to some ""lecture style"" lessons I sat through which were riveting because of both the content and the way the teacher delivered the content. Of course, I can also think of plenty of opposing scenarios. One of the hardest lessons I learned growing up is that there is a very deep satisfaction to be gained from putting mind over matter and doing my best to find something redeeming about something that is incredibly boring or difficult. That said, did everyone else in my classes have these same experiences? Were they bored to death while I was feeling satisfied from persevering? Is this why I became a teacher in the first place? If so, should be trying to make lessons easily accessible or should I be trying to teach the value of delayed gratification?

highschoolteachers,"The difference between professional sector unequal power relationships and teacher-student relationships is that in the professional sector, we may assume that both parties were over the age of consent when they met, while in the teacher-student scenario, the student is underage. I am more than willing to budge on plenty of topics, particularly regarding education, however, I will never give my approval to a teacher dating an ex student. People in here have stated that they are dating a younger person that COULD have been their student. That is faulty logic. I am a middle school teacher and I would NEVER consider dating a former student. Even if I was a high school teacher and 21 years old, I would never even consider dating an ex student. Bottom line: is it illegal to date a former student? No. But why risk 4 years of school (6+ in my case) and my entire future on a fling? It would be poor judgement on my part. For me it is not even a matter of not wanting to get caught, but a moral decision that I have made. I am given an incredible amount of trust by the public and I take that responsibility very seriously. I would never jeopardize my reputation for a relationship with an ex student. If I did, other people I work with would also begin questioning my judgement in other matters (when did the relationship start for example). You have not seen the political side of education yet so trust me when I tell you. If there is an admin that wants you gone bad enough, they will make your life so miserable that you will resign. They do this all the time, and for things WAY less serious than dating an ex student.

highschoolteachers,"From a perspective of professionalism, it is extremely unprofessional to carry on romantic relationships with current or former students. On paper, it looks bad. If documented in some kind of civil or media action, it can end your career. So it is important not to put yourself at risk professionally. It is, in most circles, unethical. That being said, I know a teacher who taught a student music from the time she was a high school senior, or maybe junior - I am honestly not sure. She graduated and was then invited back to instruct a year or more later. In secret, they began a relationship. At work, they stayed professional and discreet. They married a year later. Then the cat was out of the bag, but marriage sent a message that it was a serious personal decision and not a flippant foolery of professional indiscretion. They have a baby now. They both work in the same school system as well. I am fairly sure this could have gone another way had administrators wanted to fire this teacher. But the administration really supports them both and really wants to do whatever they can to keep them because the program is running so successfully with their leadership. So, there is more than just ethics involved. In this day and age, it is not just about ethics exclusively. Politics are everywhere. If you are on the chopping block already, dating a former student could definitely give a willing administrator the ammunition to go after you. So, I would advise against it.",perspective professionalism extremely unprofessional carry romantic relationship current former student paper look bad documented kind civil medium action end career important put risk professionally circle unethical said know teacher taught student music time senior maybe junior honestly sure graduated invited back instruct year later secret began relationship work stayed professional discreet married year later cat bag marriage sent message serious personal decision flippant foolery professional indiscretion baby work system well fairly sure could gone another way administrator wanted fire teacher administration really support really want whatever keep program running successfully leadership ethic involved day age ethic exclusively politics everywhere chopping block already dating former student could definitely give willing administrator ammunition go would advise
highschoolteachers,"The age difference is not the odd part for me. By the time everyone is 40-ish, the differences would seem trivial. There are two issues that will make it creepy for many people: 1. The relationship will appear to have started in a situation where power was unequal, but was held off or kept secret until it was ""legal."" It is similar to how bosses and subordinates are looked at when they get together soon after some sort of prohibition is off. 2. A working adult dating someone fresh out of high school is in a position which screams ""manipulation,"" and the previous power imbalance does not help that image. Really, I date a former student. I was teaching a night class PT at a university, and met a working adult taking continuing ed courses. We started dating maybe six months after I left the university, and have been together almost thirteen years. I **still** feel odd telling anyone the story, and insert all sorts of caveats about how it started and that I did not date her (or even really know anything about her) when she was in my class. (Wow, I am defending myself again! See?) Honestly, we both often lie and say we met at her tour agency while I was looking for a vacation. Anyway ... at that point, we were both well into our adult working lives, and yet people see how we met as a little creepy. The HS teacher / student relationship is just going to be ten times worse.

highschoolteachers,"First, take a deep breath and enjoy your Christmas break. ;) Second, do not think yet about what you plan on doing after this year-- whether teaching or otherwise. Look at what is in front of you (second semester) and that is it. A really awesome, wise mentor teacher told me my first year that the best gift a teacher can give themselves is a second year, but you have to get through your first one first. I think that you should spend this break taking a good, long look at your personality and use the break to decide how your real personality will influence your professional one. This may be unsettling, but a teacher who lives a balanced life is not their full real self in the classroom and that is okay. Who you are at home, with your friends is not who you are in the classroom. You can care about your students and some of them may come to like you and your classroom, but there will always be a professional barrier that will make ""friendships"" with students in reality mentorships at best, that will keep you from losing your cool, and will let all their snide comments roll off your back at the end of the day. If you are a sarcastic person IRL, you need to leave that at the door now. Even if it is sarcasm directed at yourself. Sarcasm is one of my favorite languages :), but I have learned over years of teaching elementary, middle, and high school that sarcasm is best only used in small amount WHEN you have developed a rapport and trust with your students, and ONLY then! (And in age-appropriate situations!) Go on Amazon today and order the book ""Teach Like a Champion."" It will be a lifesaver and a career saver. Trust me. Even if you do not stay in teaching, you will want positive reviews from your peers this year. It is okay to struggle but show admin you are willing to work on those struggles. Kids imitate so much. If you are using humor to poke fun at yourself, these kids may not yet fully grasp that your self-deprecation is not an invitation to join with you in making fun of yourself. So for right now, stop this humor as a classroom management tool. Find jokes you can make that are corny and going to make the kids roll their eyes, but not at your expense. First years are lonely and hard and tiring and exhausting. It is hard to deal with attitude and not know anyone on staff well enough yet to seek out encouragement from them. But you have the ability to regain control of your class if you are willing to make certain changes, be humble, and learn to distance yourself from taking anything personally in teaching. My first year I had a class I never won over. But I took Christmas break to take a hard look at where I was losing them, started second semester saying ""I am a new teacher and still learning what works and what does not. Here are new changes I am making for reasons x, y, and z. I am telling you these things because I want you as my students to be aware of why I am making these changes."" I never fully had rapport with those kids like I did future years, but I was able to get a better foothold and develop skills that let me create a classroom environment where I could build rapport with future kids. And I love what I do now. But that first year? They were mean and made me cry but at the end of the day, they were the kids and I was the professional and it was my job to make that change happen. And trust me, there are plenty of kids who want you to succeed because they do not want to waste class for a year. Also, I am going to note that my first year was in a small, private religious 6-12 school. If you are afraid of what admin is going to think of your teaching, then either something is wrong with admin or something is wrong with your teaching. I am not saying this to condemn, I am saying this to say that if there is a problem, it is only going to be fixed if you acknowledge that it is there. You may dismiss comments in this thread saying I cannot do what these other people are doing, or easy for you all to say with years under your experience. BUT we all had to start somewhere and we have all had poor experiences we brought upon ourselves. The teachers in this thread with multiple years of experience who are telling you that you need to make changes are saying this because we learned that in order to have any success we needed to get help. We found that help, we used other teacher's advice and demonstration lessons to change what was not working and slowly but surely found success. Finally, GOOD free form teaching comes with years of experience. Do not write 2-3 page lesson plans for every prep, but have a plan and have a back-up plan (an extra activity if the lesson goes quickly) for every class. I have loads of advice so reply to this message with a comment if you would like specific pointers but suffice to say I can only ""wing"" it now because I put in the hard work and time my first couple years. Also, as a final note... classroom management is a science just as much as it is an art. It becomes an art when you have had years of experience in reading people and students and becoming better at building relationships with your classes. But it is a science and a science you can LEARN from books like ""Teach Like a Champion"" (srsly, GO READ IT). I just read it this year (in my fifth year!) and wish I would had it my first year of teaching. And true, students will not be nearly as mean if they like you. But they will still misbehave. ;) Trust me. I have gone through those days in November where you are just WAITING for Christmas break to get here and not as on the ball with management and my best kids who love me and I love them will goof off. It is not personal, I would have done the same. My favorite class in HS is the subject I am teaching now and I ADORED the teacher who taught that subject but I wrote so many notes to friends during that class during independent work because I was a teen and friends were top priority. Kids will like you when they respect you. And they respect you when you give them the tools to respect you-- clear expectations, reasonable guidelines, ""fair"" consequences (I say ""fair"" because no consequences can ever be fully fair but you can implement them in a way that makes students feel like they are), and a 2-way street of respect, and showing students you CARE. If you do not want to hear them talk about inappropriate personal topics or do not want them sharing in class, simply say, ""hey student, I really am concerned that you are going through this, can you stay for a couple minutes after class and we will talk?"" or just approach them after class. And even if you think it is stupid, still show you care, it will go a long way. I have spent SO much time learning about subjects I will probably never show interest in outside of time with students, but you know what? I have built a rapport with these kids that makes my job and work worth it. So if I have to sit and listen about a YA book I will never ever read (or want to read) but they leave the conversation feeling heard, AWESOME.

highschoolteachers,"I use two different things in my advisory class: basic life skills and Fun Fridays. I created a basic life skills quiz for my kids (laundry, cooking, reading a map, responding to an emergency, social skills, money skills, etc.) then used it to see which basic life skills we should practice. When I taught the high school level, it was terrifying to see how many kids did not know their own address or how to read an analog clock. I also use Fun Fridays. Students are asked to work on homework or read a novel the other days of the week; if they use their time well, we have Fun Friday. Each week I plan a high engagement object lesson in which kids participate, then we have a short discussion about it. As a few examples, Send several students out of the room and create a variation on [The Asch Conformity Tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) Or our Tribes Activity: students were given basic instructions of how to communicate. Unknown to the students, each half of the class got a different set of instructions that were polar opposite (look the speaker in the eye vs. eye contact shows defiance or a challenge, maintain personal space vs. stand class to show interest, etc.). The only direction that is the same is that you should always ask the other person about their interests and avoid talking about yourself. The result is hilarious. We then can talk about cultural differences and how giving your best does not always look that way to others, so be careful before judging actions. It can even be team building games, like the human knot or silent ball, which students weirdly love.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;Sorry if I made it seem like I do not respect kids but no offense but not being able to get beer for a party you should not even be at is in my mind a pretty trivial problem. I am pretty empathetic to a lot of my kids who have genuine problems, like my 4th grade class where all but one have divorced parents. That is tough shit. That is hard to deal with and I commend them for still being fairly happy most days. I do not have sympathy for a teen who is biggest issue is ""my mom grounded me for drinking"" Do you think they are actually talking about their serious problems in front of you? Of course they are not. You talk about them like you are still in high school and you are still caught up in those social dynamics. It worries me massively. &gt;But yes I will admit i lack empathy in a lot of cases. But at the same time its crap to be sympathetic to someone who is biggest problem is not that big. Should I bake a cake for a spoiled girl who is depressed because her mom got her fake uggs instead of real ones? You do not know their lives. I have already told you once that I find your disrespectful speech about your pupils unacceptable. You have chosen to repeat this unacceptable behaviour. If you were in my class, I would move you to an isolated area of the classroom now. If you repeated the behaviour again you would receive an appropriate punishment exercise and your parents would be informed of your behaviour. (see? behaviour management!) But you are not in my class, so all I can say to you is that if the attitude you have for your students shines through, it is no wonder they treat you like shit. People tend not to react well to people who despise them. I have had spoiled kids before. They are frustrating. But the truth is that they are probably not getting discipline at home. They are probably not getting a lot of social attention. Their parents are buying them off ith material shit. The spoiled kids will usually get on board if you give them the shit they are deprived of elsewhere i.e boundaries, discipline, empathy and support.

highschoolteachers,"&gt;You are right about this. It is just harder for me to see it with older kids. That is where being empathetic and understanding comes in. &gt;I mean their problems are usually their own doing. And in my case its mostly first world white kid problems. Okay I am going to have to come in right now with my teacher voice and tell you to cut that shit right now. You are talking about your pupils in an incredibly dismissive and cruel way and it is in no way whatsoever acceptable. You are the adult. Act like it. I have read your comments where you say your dad having cancer and being bullied made high school hard for you, were those first world white kid problems? I am amazed that someone who wants so much sympathy is so unwilling to extend the most basic level of empathy to his own students. If you have so many fucking excuses for why you cannot do your job, why are you so unwilling to believe your kids might have valid reasons to be acting the way they are? &gt;I guess I feel the same way about kids in sped. They do not know any better and cannot control their behavior and strangely enough I can handle it when someone does not know any better because I know its them so much as them being a victim of circumstances like a disorder. You need to stop viewing misbehaviour as something that originates in a deficit in the child. Children's behaviour depends on the interplay between external forces (school, home, **you**), internal resources (their learned knowledge) and state of mind. You have control here.",it right harder see older kid empathetic understanding come it mean problem usually case mostly first world white kid problem okay going come right teacher voice tell cut shit right talking pupil incredibly dismissive cruel way way whatsoever acceptable adult act like read comment say dad cancer bullied made hard first world white kid problem amazed someone want much sympathy unwilling extend basic level empathy student many fucking excuse cannot job unwilling believe kid might valid reason acting way it guess feel way kid sped know better cannot control behavior strangely enough handle someone know better know much victim circumstance like disorder need stop viewing misbehaviour something originates deficit child child behaviour depends interplay external force home internal resource learned knowledge state mind control
highschoolteachers,"I want to turn the question around to you: Do you enjoy working with other people, especially high school students? Have you had some experiences working with high schoolers? Did you enjoy it? I ask this because teaching is not as much about the content as working with kids. Your main duties revolve around kids, managing a classroom, managing behavior, monitoring students for understanding, checking student assignments, facilitating student discussion, contacting parents etc. Creating an interesting lesson and actually teaching the content is part of teaching but you will find yourself working with the student for the majority of the time. If your reason to go into teaching is to make a difference then I would say you should reconsider. You only really feel like you made a difference at the end of the year as you are wrapping up just before final exams. Throughout the year it is a long slog working and building up your students and feeling like you are having a limited impact. Try volunteering at a school, most public schools have some sort of volunteer system that you can sign up for. You could also call a school directly and offer yourself as a volunteer to help a teacher. Politics at the school varies from state to state, district to district and campus to campus. It is the luck of the draw. The best way to know is to ask teachers who are currently teaching in the districts that you are planning to teach in. In general though, schools are very top down organizations. The district adopts a new approach/program then suddenly the teachers are expected to follow along. School accountability puts a lot of pressure on core teachers to teach to the test and focus their energy towards the test. TLDR:""If it was not for the kids, I would not continue being a teacher"" The graphic design path is a good path to pursue as well, if you really love working with clients and graphics then you may get more satisfaction from it.",want turn question around enjoy working people especially student experience working schoolers enjoy ask teaching much content working kid main duty revolve around kid managing classroom managing behavior monitoring student understanding checking student assignment facilitating student discussion contacting parent etc creating interesting lesson actually teaching content part teaching find working student majority time reason go teaching make difference would say reconsider really feel like made difference end year wrapping final exam throughout year long slog working building student feeling like limited impact try volunteering public school sort volunteer system sign could also call directly offer volunteer help teacher politics varies state state district district campus campus luck draw best way know ask teacher currently teaching district planning teach general though school top organization district adopts new approach program suddenly teacher expected follow along accountability put lot pressure core teacher teach test focus energy towards test told kid would continue teacher graphic design path good path pursue well really love working client graphic may get satisfaction
highschoolteachers,"Nah, I am not going to give you any platitudes about respect - we all know the deal. But not a jerk. You see, if your frame of reference is ""bullying"" vs. ""bullied,"" then if you are toward the ""bully"" side of that spectrum, you are in the ""jerk"" range, and if you are toward the ""bullied"" side then you are a ""victim."" You need to shift your frame of reference to ""adult teacher authority get-with-the-program"" vs. ""child student learner wants-structure-so-give-me-the-program."" You are forthcoming about being bullied, and feeling powerless, and you are experiencing the exact same dynamics because you are back in high school. Screw high school. You are ""The Man"" now. But not ""The Dick."" That requires control, patience, and complete validity in your actions. And you know something? As far as ""Respect is earned,"" you need to know that authority is earned as well. But it is best earned with a look, a quiet stare, or a quick reprimand and move on. Given that you mentioned a quick temper, I wonder if maybe you end up yelling or otherwise losing your cool in front of the class? If so, then know that there is no better way to lose respect, even if you keep your authority because you can enforce school rules. But respectful authority is the tough one. Have you experienced that?

highschoolteachers,"Your thinking here is not individual- most kids in high school do not see the point in a lot of their learning. Try to remember that a lot of your learning is not learning the knowledge, it is learning the skills to get more of that knowledge. So learning something like maths will develop your brain to be much better at stuff like critical thinking, spatial awareness, and so on. If you are not going to be a mathematician, you are not going to need the EXACT skill to develop theorems. But through learning theorems, you are going to be developing parts of your brain that will be useful for, say, being an electrician. I have never heard of those UK schools, and I have lived in the UK all my life. In England, minimum school leaving age is 17, and in Scotland, it is 16. You would have to look up Wales and NI. I do not know how old you are, but if you have got 1-4 years left of high school, then that is 2-4 years of decades and decades of your life. If you can do what you want to do whenever, then cool. If there is a tiny possibility you may want to change careers in any year out of those decades, you could be kicking yourself for not just stepping up and finishing, especially as you seem to find it so easy.

Now I am actually doing it, I have realised it is just not for me. I think it is stupid getting kids to take tests and decide on their futures before they are even 18.

highschoolteachers,"One high school a friend resigned from had a filthy staff room and the principal would not supply enough milk in case teachers used it on their breakfast. A staff room with plentiful tea, coffee, milk etc and basics like salt, pepper and butter really does wonders for morale. Also, that school did not have sufficient women's toilets (or hygene disposal units) and they were not cleaned properly. you do not care about your staff if you do not look after their physical needs. Have to agree with others about support when handling difficult parents and also in recognising the work people do. Some teachers leave at 3:30 with their handbags as they use technology to plan lessons and mark work but never get acknowledged while others stay at work until six doing the same work. Some teachers have great classrooms, others always take the lowest sports team every year. Praise and acknowledge the work teachers do, as often they only hear the next thing they have to do, and the things they are not doing right. Also, share the learning opportunities. Often the same people get many opportunities to develop, while other teachers get none. If you want all students to succeed, all teachers have to be given a chance to grow, not just selected staff. This goes to social events like an end of term meal. Make sure everyone is welcome and ensure they have a good time, not just certain staff members. Do not get me started on the biggest morale killers of teaching- initiative overload and blatant overwork. Look at timetables and if you have a heavy week, skip staff PD, meetings etc. One school I know has a wellness programme for staff that includes weekly goals like 'leave work by 4' week and 'being your water bottle to work' week with silly prizes for staff (again, not the same ones every week as this kills morale). Another has Friday Flowers where one teacher gets given flowers for something they did and the next week they give some to another teacher however these were passed around the same teachers every week so 2/3 of staff never got them and it was a morale killer. However, there is also a tradition in my country of a wooden spoon award for a mighty (but funny) mistake e.g. Forgetting to go to a class, misspelling the same word on every report, driving a sports team to the wrong place etc. Keep it fair, be considerate and include everyone and morale is good.

highschoolteachers,"1. Yes, email principals. Many times I have been told that is the way to be noticed. Plus, it shows you are interested and not just randomly applying. In your email I would put something you like about the school but not like a - hey, I have been stalking the school type of thing. For example: I applied at the high school majority of my in laws attended and was able to speak highly of the district and school in an email based off of what they have told me and their education. Make sense? 2. Subbing or volunteering is a great way to check out a school. Look at the PTA involvement and programs. Also see if you can maybe find a way to see the teachers interact with each other. I have found that to be incredibly valuable. My school last year had very little teacher interaction. No talking or waving in the parking lot, no good morning, nothing. During an interview I was lucky enough to see a staff meeting being dismissed so I saw all of the staff laughing and interacting, talking in the parking lot etc. I love my job and coworkers. I could not say that before. My school does not even have a PTA but our teachers make up for that. Just a few examples. :) 3. If you are going to move, do it now. No offense but once you are sucked in, it is kind of hard. Plus, some states have different requirements and tests. This will save you from starting over. On the other hand, being a first year teacher, I would recommend staying where you know you could get a job. It is 50/50. You would have a job and experience to move out of state after a year or two, but then you might have to do the tests again.

You are walking into a classroom of up to 30 unknowns. Start out stricter than you are comfortable with. Remember, strict does not equate to mean. Set your expectations for behavior and quality of work high and hold the students to them. If you find after the year has started that the current class is mature enough to handle you loosening up a little, joking a little, having a little more independent work time - by all means do so. But remember, it is easier to loosen up on the reigns than trying to reign in a class that has gotten out of hand. Also, one survival technique: you do not have to grade every scrap of paper that comes across your desk. You are already going to be pressed for time in your personal life as well as your professional life. Pick and choose the assignments you grade, call the assignments you do not grade student practice. Now the weird one: find your teacher voice. It is different than your conversational voice. It is also different than anybody else's teacher voice. One thing I can tell you - it is not a shout or a yell. It carries conviction and confidence. It shows that you care, but also demands respect. Once you find it, use it on students AND their parents. You have chosen a hard career, but one that is worthy of your time and effort.

highschoolteachers,"I teach high school math. I agree with arguments on both sides too. At this point in my career, I am working these on a case by case basis. For example , today I was in a parent conference with a student and was asked if the student could turn in late work for credit . I said he can do it and I will happily look over it for him, but he will not receive credit for the assignments. However , if he does the assignments for an entire unit, showing me he has actually practiced the content, I will allow him to retake the quiz and/or test for that unit (which ultimately would have a better effect anyway). I figure with exams coming up, at least it would have him studying something. I do not advertise it .

highschoolteachers,"I am not a veteran, but I am a current student teacher enrolled in a year long immersion student teaching program. I work in a very economically depressed city, so some of the behavior I have had to deal with has been pretty extreme. To answer your questions: 1. The worst behaviors I have had to deal with have mainly been students who simply do not care about any consequence you throw at them. I know this is a broad Explanation, but the kids who care about grades and consequences are pretty easy to work with. The behavior that you will see from kids who simply do not care can be really difficult. If you are not in a high poverty area, I would not expect this to be as much of a problem, but I have seen some crazy stuff. We had one kid who tried to break one the door by smashing it with his body. Where I work there are a lot of gang affiliated middle schoolers so I have had to deal with kids who see violence and drugs on a daily basis. 2. Every day I feel a little bit more comfortable with my instructional abilities and classroom management. Both are areas that require development, and you should expect to be a little shaky at first. After 4 months of student teaching I feel comfortable in front of the class, and most of my fellow student teachers do as well. Do not worry if you feel awkward up there at first, it will come with time. 3. Making lesson plans is still a challenge for me, especially because I am getting my masters, and doing a lot of work for that after school. Use the Internet, it kind of feels like cheating but it really is not if the lessons are good. Oftentimes I take lesson plans from the Internet and tweak them to what I think will work better with my kids. Also, try to find a good veteran teacher of your subject in your school and ask them for advice and resources. 4. Google. If you are a history teacher I can recommend the ""resourcesforhistoryteachers"" page on wikispaces, or the Stanford history education group site. I can guarantee if you google ""______ lesson plan"" you will find something although a lot of online lesson plans are garbage so you will have to weed out the good ones. Also there is an app called class dojo that I use on a daily basis and has worked wonders. Each student from each class gets a little monster that has their name under it, and you can award them points for good work and behavior, or take away points for bad behavior. It is great because you can give rewards to the kids with the most points, and send home weekly reports for the parents of kids with negative points. It might be better in middle school than high school but you should at least check it out. 5. Being that the school I work at has no money, I have little experience with using technology. The few times that we have used the computer lab, I have had issues with keeping kids on task. I really cannot help too much with that, although class dojo can probably be an effective way to incentivize good behavior in general. 6. Get some sleep and relax every now and then. If you are getting your masters, or working another job (or both like me) then you are going to probably end up pretty stressed out. Make sure you are getting enough sleep and unwinding every now and then. You would be amazed the difference it makes for your abilities if you are well rested. Also, do not beat yourself up if you have a bad day. It is going to happen, but most of my best days come after bad days. Instead of getting down on yourself, think of what went wrong, and how it could have gone better. The next day, focus on those areas and try new things. I would also suggest you find the best teachers in your school and observe what they do. I have learned most of my best techniques and strategies from veterans in my school.

I got an A for maths and art and French. Int. 2's are not university-getting qualifications, highers are the important ones. They said they wanted 2 A's and 2 B's in Highers. Lol.

You do Intermediate 2's from 4th to 5th, and highers in 5th. You do other qualifications in 6th year but you need to send off your application before you know your results.

highschoolteachers,"I taught for high school biology/chemistry for three years and decided to make a career move. I am a software engineer now and thoroughly love my job. There is much more autonomy, much less politics and stress, and I really enjoy coding. It also pays much better which does not hurt either. Deciding to leave teaching was a tough decision for me to make at the time. I felt like I really started to figure some things out and actually begin to serve as a resource for my own peer teachers during my third year and I found I was enjoying the job more and more. But it was still a ton of stress and work and I did not feel like I could sustain it for an entire career as I am somewhat of an introvert and find being around huge groups of people all day to be exhausting for me, even though it can be fun and enjoyable at times. Looking back though, I do not regret making the move, and see teaching as the most stressful and difficult job I ever had, as rewarding as it can be. The catch is I had to go back to school and earn a Master's degree to make the move, so I had to spend two years not pulling a paycheck and now have that extra debt hanging over me, which many folks may not have the flexibility to do.

highschoolteachers,"I guess I can see where this is a difference between high school &amp; middle school, then. I have 150 students, mostly juniors/seniors, many of whom are in AP or college-level classes. Grading their essays moves much more into that subjective territory and requires a fair bit of nuance to help nudge them in the right direction. Even a few margin comments + a 3 sentence end comment ends up taking 10-20 minutes, depending on the assignment. High school English tests also tend to move pretty far away from the types of multiple choice questions you describe, too, especially when you get into literary analysis and arguing *how well* writers use techniques. Add to high school the additional requirements on English teachers -- writing letters of rec and giving feedback on college essays being the 2 biggest timesucks that do not affect middle school teachers too much. I guess what I am saying is to maybe be a little less strident in your judgment that ""if you are staying late you are doing it wrong.""

highschoolteachers,"I can try! I work primarily in elementary and prek so maybe it is way different when you are in high school (and should be?) From a behavioral psychology standpoint, all behaviors happen for one of 4 reasons. Attention. Escape/avoidance. Access to tangible items. Sensory. When you break down to a specific behavior (in this instance hitting) and look at what happened immediately before and after it, this gives a pretty accurate hypothesis for which of the 4 this falls under. If you react to it and it happens more often, its likely attention. If you have withheld an item they want and they hit it is access to tangible. If you send the to the principal every time and it happens more often it is likely escape or avoidance of your class. Family life, drugs, whatever are all factors that make it more likely to happen (setting events), but at their core each particular smaller behavior happens for one of those reasons. If it is attention, you ignore it. You do not give attention to the behavior after it happens and it makes it less likely to happen in the future because they learn they get nothing out of doing it. They reliably do not get the reinforcement for doing it and it will not happen in the future. Yes, this is not how the real world is and I get that. BUT if you ignore it in the school setting and the behavior decreases or is eliminated it is way more likely to not happen in the real world either. A school is a contrived situation where you can control what gets reinforced and what does not. If you can eliminate these behaviors at school (and try to get parents to do so at home) they will generalize this to the real world too because they have not had the behavior reinforced, but have had socially acceptable (and easier) replacement behaviors reinforced. Of course, you should ALWAYS teach a socially acceptable replacement behavior that gives the student access to the same reinforcement. In this case, if the hit was for attention you would teach the student to call out your name or raise their hand to get your attention. Or even say ""I am so mad and want you to pay more attention to me."" Anything that you would accept like this. If it was to escape, which seems like another very strong possibility (say he hated your class and you sent him to the principal once he hit you, thus escaping the class he dowsnt want to be in) you would make him stay in the class no.matter what. If he did.it to.avoid your.class (before your class even started) you would do the same. But you would teach them to say ""I need a break"" and give them access to one at a mpre appropriate time and help them figure out a way to get any work they miss done.

I likely would not ask a third grade student how to improve my class. I teach high school, and I 100% disagree with ""If you want to find out how to make a lesson better, ask other professionals"". With high school students, if you make them feel like they are a part of the learning process, and give them choices of how their class is arranged, they will respect you more.

You could do - TTFSS? Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sat, Sun, Monday. That is pretty good too- if they are sharp they will get this one.

Go to wikipedia and find the top movies of 2013/2014. Then google ""scene from (name of movie)"". Save the pic and make a slide show- team that guesses the most wins.

highschoolteachers,"I just got hired halfway through last semester after a teacher quit. I started teaching three high school math classes on one day's notice. I made it through the semester, but I was extremely busy. Here is what I learned: 1. If they are reasonable people, they will lower their expectations for you due to the circumstances. They understand it is difficult to start partway through the year. 2. Ask for as much resources as possible. Get everything that past teachers have. Hopefully they can provide you with a semester plan. This will really save time, and you can always adjust it to match your style. 3. Do not ask too many questions. You are fully educated in this field. There is no reason why you should have trouble getting the job done. 4. Go easy on the students. It is not ideal for them to get a new teacher partway through, so be understanding of this. Start off slow, get to know them (do some sort of activity on your first day that helps with this), make sure they respect you, and then slowly but surely demand more and more from them. 5. Do some diagnostic assessment with the students to gauge how they learn and how much they have learned. Ask them for suggestions on how to make your lessons better. This is also the best way to react to a student that is being disruptive or not doing their work. If they cannot think of a way for you to make the class better (and you cannot either), then the responsibility is on them to take greater initiative. 6. Get adequate sleep.

highschoolteachers,"Sorry about that. Started the reply on the iPad but it took too long. First thing you need to know about becoming a history teacher is that you will NOT necessarily be teaching your dream class right away. Not many first year teachers get an AP High School gig. It is usually earned after many years of practice. Many of the kids will not be as passionate about history as you (in fact, most of them will actually hate history). Second: Teaching is NOT like the movies. You will most likely be in a rough school for your first couple of years dealing with 70% behavior issues, 20% mandated activities (non-fiction reading skills), and only 10% content. I am just as passionate about history as you and was shocked at the very little amount of autonomy I was given to teach the topics I like the way I want to. You have connections so you definitely want to use them to your advantage. You might be able to skip the middle school years and go right to high school. As a new teacher, you will not be given the opportunity to teach the AP and Honors classes until you have done your time with the CP level classes. As for college, you will probably have to adjust your work hours a bit, as undergrad education classes (and all of your practicum and student teaching) are mostly taken during the day. This may differ depending on the size of the university. You will need to take around 30 credits of history courses and 30 education credits. Should not take more than 3 years. Find a program that has a good relationship with local schools so your student teaching placement is not a pain in the ass. You will not be able to work during student teaching so take that into consideration. I am in my first year and although I am grateful to be in a great school, I have really struggled. I always heard other people talking about how the first year was hell. I never believed them; always thought ""that is them! I will be different."" Well, I am not lol. I am struggling with differentiation, scaffolding, classroom management, lesson planning, etc. Would I trade it in for the jobs I had before teaching? Absolutely not! I am told that the more experience I get, the better I will become, and the more I will enjoy the job.

highschoolteachers,"Ready...? Once upon a time we tried to integrate schools based solely on race. We knew it was the right thing, but around 1975 it cooled down with a court case - Miliken v Bradley. Since that time schools have continued to become more and more segregated, by race and income. This in and of itself is not problematic. Now we give kids standardized tests. We have decades of performance data. Even if the test is shit, it is consistent taken in the aggregate and over time. We have evidence of the disparity of performance. Let us take this a step farther. CA tests students on their readiness for college. Again, same shitty test conditions.

highschoolteachers,"That is the question I am now posing to parents and teachers alike. Now that I am an administrator and I have moved a K-8 system to standards based grading it really exposes a lot of those grading elephants in the room. Teachers using grades as a carrot and stick become problematic when the real question is ""can the student do standard X."" I have had to have a number of conversations on how teachers can encourage behaviors without attaching grades to the behaviors. When you have teachers that give numerous extra credit opportunities (sometimes not even connected to content), it often either causes greater than 100% grades or is used as a crutch for a class that is too difficult. So in the new system I have had to move the phrase ""extra credit"" to ""extra chances."" At the end of the day, if the kid can do the work, what does it matter (if teaching the work is the goal)?

The rest of the class had GREAT questions, really coming up with amazing reasons why there might be problems with the laws and forcing everyone to analyze their opinions and support them with facts. I sat in a desk as a student, raising my hand when I had a question too, so the kids presenting could feel like they were really leading the class. There was some chaos, for sure, but I was super happy to see kids having some great debates. Tomorrow's our statewide writing test, which my sophomores have to pass to pass high school.

It is challenging and frightening and really fucking amazing.

I get to talk about important and real issues with my kids - my seniors and I are doing a Race in America unit and it is awesome and uplifting to hear them discuss their thoughts, feelings, political opinions, and visions for the future. I get to joke around with my kids and watch them mature (even in the 6 months I have had my 9th graders they have grown up so much!). I get to teach them how to write and speak and read and understand information about the world around them; how to communicate! I teach my students how to be a person, how to interact with each other, how to participate in our society.

For instance, there was today. I was teaching the students about the Bill of Rights and the students started asking me questions about some of the individual amendments. Then we got on the discussion of the death penalty being seen as ""cruel and unusual punishment"" by some people. This led to an unplanned debate where the students explained their positions back and forth and used their critical thinking skills. As I watched, I felt so proud seeing them form their own opinions and explain them thoroughly. And then after school, I was discussing with a student an upcoming event she is helping me with. She then said that when she graduates, I will be one of the few teachers she will come back and visit. That made me super happy. Now of course, I have had my fair share of difficulties.

Play a song and let them move. Stop the music and have them find a partner. Give them a task (answer a question, for example). I do this 4 times max.

I also spent many years teaching swimming and life-guarding, which really helped when I got into the classroom. Knowledge of a subject is important. But the ability to convey the knowledge does not come naturally to most. Think about your college classes, many were probably just professors writing on a chalk board or using PPTs. If you were lucky you had a good recitation where a TA helped you work while you were in groups or something similar. Teaching high school is a lot more like the good recitation than the lecture. You have to combine elements of both. But if you just get up and lecture everyday, you will not last long at all at most public schools.

highschoolteachers,"I feel you on the ""every single day cannot be amazing"" thing, but here is a couple ideas for you. I teach Spanish in high school. 1. When possible, recycle good activities that you have already done. Vocab games for chapter 1 can be adapted to chapter 2 with minimal work for you. It is more bang for your buck, and in my experience, the kids like it because they already know the rules and expectations for the activity. For example, when teaching new verb tenses, my classes will play ""Uno"" using cards with different verb forms. I have 3-4 different ""Uno"" games that we will play throughout the year as we learn new tenses. Making a new version is easy once you have a template. 2. Get ideas from [TeachersPayTeachers](http://www.teacherspayteachers.com). Sometimes I buy an activity, sometimes I will borrow the idea but make the materials myself, but usually I will look at the free activities and download or adapt those. 3. Maybe this is unsustainable for middle school, but one good speaking activity I do is ""Find somebody who..."" I use it as an icebreaker at the beginning of the year, I then recycle it throughout the year (see #1). Make a worksheet with 5-10 descriptions on it and have them ask their classmates the questions until they find someone who fits/says yes. For example, if it is a family chapter, questions would be ""Find somebody who has more than 3 siblings,"" ""Find somebody whose grandparents live nearby,"" ""Find somebody who does not have any siblings,"" etc. Students would circulate and ask each other, ""Tom, do you have more than 3 siblings?"" Tom says no, so the student asks Jerry. Jerry says ""Yes, I have 4,"" so the student writes ""Jerry has 4 siblings"" for that item and moves along to the next one. I have them write down their answers to prove that they did it, but the emphasis is on the speaking exchange. Monitor them with a clipboard and take off points for speaking English or just pointing and nodding at questions instead of speaking and make that a participation grade. My students really like this activity because they get to go talk to different people, and it is unstructured but goal oriented.

highschoolteachers,"I said none of the words that you put in my mouth at all. High school teachers should be able to show the minimum **high-school student** competency. Elementary teachers should be able to do everything elementary students are expected to do. This says nothing about the teachers' qualifications for teaching or ability to teach, especially in the HS subjects they teach. It is just basic fundamental competency. ES/MS/HS teachers should be able to perform at the level expected for the students they teach, then have SME knowledge in specific subjects if at the 7-12 level. Math teachers should be able to write, read critically, and understand social events. English teachers should know how to do basic math. These are the same things we require of students graduating from high school. HS teachers should at least be on general HS level.

highschoolteachers,"A friend of mine used a tally system on a laminated seating chart. She had one on a clip board for each class (high school history). She would give a student a mark for being in his/her seat on time with the materials and a marks at the end of the period for having the area clean before leaving. She would then randomly give 3 marks during the period to any students working. It was a quick system and the kids responded well to it. EDIT: She used a dry erase marker and counted points at the end of each day or when it was convenient (sometimes the end of the week). She would erase the marks after putting the points into her grade book. I work in MS, and I used the Organized Binder system. They have this Weekly Lifeline page which is a warm up that allows me to get the kids focused on the lesson AND give participation points. They get a question and give a response (on their log) within the first two minutes of class. At the end of class, they have to write a reflection on something they learned. On Fridays, I collect their logs as their ""ticket out."" They are worth 10 points a week, but 2 points a day. In my drama class, I grade participation on a random thing each day (usually having their script and/or writing in their journal). It is 5 points a day. Since it is a participatory and elective class, it ends up being worth 50% of their grade.",friend mine used tally system laminated seating chart one clip board class history would give student mark seat time material mark end period area clean leaving would randomly give mark period student working quick system kid responded well edit used dry erase marker counted point end day convenient sometimes end week would erase mark putting point grade book work i used organized binder system weekly lifeline page warm allows get kid focused lesson give participation point get question give response log within first two minute class end class write reflection something learned friday collect log ticket worth point week point day drama class grade participation random thing day usually script writing journal point day since participatory elective class end worth grade

highschoolteachers,"For high school, in each unit I provided a list of questions with page numbers corresponding to each day of the unit. The answers for all textbook questions are at the back of the textbook. These are recommended practice matching concepts covered in class. I gave in-class open book assignments (formative or summatively marked), quizzes &amp; mini quizzes (10 min max @ start of class or end of lesson to check for understanding, and unit exams. The current research supports the idea that assigned homework for grades is not meaningful assessment. Students do not do it, time wasted tracking and nagging, some students honestly do not need to do the extra practice to learn the concepts to an excellent level, we all know some copy answers from each other, the back of the book etc. I have students sign an agreement at the beginning of the course. This includes their responsibility to complete practice questions at home and to study for all assessments, to arrange with 1 or 2 other students to get the notes or handouts if they are sick or absent and participate during class to take notes, engage in activities, answer questions and compete practice when time of provided. My mini quizzes were often the exact same questions or a couple of the questions out of the textbook. So it was easy to tell to at least tried the questions. I would ask at the start of class if there were any questions on the recommended list that anyone had a problem with - usually no one did because the kids who cared did the questions, checked their answers and figured out what they did wrong OR did not bother to even try the practice. If I had time I would use a check list to keep track of who would bring up questions for clarification so I could comment that it was evident they were taking responsibility for their learning. I also knew which were the most challenging and started the lesson off reviewing one or two from the list when no one brought up specific questions. Every student needs to practice each concept to varying degrees. If not doing homework is earning you the grade you want (parents want) the do not do homework. Tests, quizzes etc are not optional. If you want to improve your understanding &amp; increase your grade it was their job to do the logical step and increase their effort and amt of practice. In the end it took WAYS less time marking a 1-3 question mini quiz outside of class, especially to indicate acceptable/adequate understanding, proficient or excellent understanding and developing understanding than checking and following up on homework. While students did mini quiz I was able to take attendance, get things organized. Students knew to automatically come in pick up a mini quiz and start in on it.

Those who can realize that there is not enough to do so they teach anyway. In NYC a lot of schools outsource their arts programs, which makes this kind of thing easier. Rather than having full-time staffers they bring in an outside company to do productions and a class here or there. It means more flexibility for the teachers and the school usually has it easier.

highschoolteachers,"Yes, I am American. I did not learn any Japanese before I moved here, I am now super beginner (I know a few words and phrases, can read the first alphabet). Let us see, I worked at a Junior High School, if you get a job (they call it ALT usually) at a JHS or SH you do not need to speak Japanese. Your work is ""part-time"" if you work at a public high-school, but may be full-time if you get a job at a private school (you probably have to speak Japanese or have more experience to get a job like that). I say ""part-time"" because it was really more like full-time. I was supposed to be at work at 8:30, I usually arrived around 8:10 because that is just when my local train was timed for. Usually in Japan a 1 hour commute is considered normal, from what I have heard, though if you are single you might have more freedom to move to a place closer to your job. My usual day after I got to work was 4 classes, lunch, then 2 classes. At Junior and Senior high schools there is 3 grades each, and ALTs work with all the students. So I might have a 1st grade class (YOU.S. 7th grade - 12 year olds) then a 3rd grade class (YOU.S. 9th grade - 14 year olds), then 2 2nd grade classes (YOU.S. 8th grade - 13 year olds). After the first 4 classes there was a lunch period and I at the school lunch. All the teachers and students ate the same school lunch and all the students in the prefecture (in all of Japan?!) eat the same thing. It was usually a bowl of rice, some kind of soup, what they called a salad (it was usually some kind of pickled vegetables, never a salad made with lettuce) and a meat. So after lunch there is usually 2 more classes, then after school clubs and activities. For me, class usually ended at 2:30 some days and 3:30 other days, but I was not allowed to leave until after 4:30. So after you are done with classes you have basically an hour of free time. I would visit various sports or clubs (I often played with the table-tennis team) or just read at my desk. Sometimes the English teacher(s) would ask me to grade something. It was really easy, like to read the english ""essays"" (around a paragraph long) and correct any spelling or grammar mistakes, or grade the test (just make sure the correct answer or letter is marked, or check the spelling on vocab tests). In the class work I would say it was also pretty easy, the main job for us is supposed to be making sure of proper pronunciation. There is a ""primary"" English teacher who is usually Japanese and can speak both Japanese and English, but the Japanese government about 20 years ago made a requirement that a native, or native-level, English speaker is present in any English classes. So there is a lot of jobs available for native speakers, we are there to make sure the students and teacher are pronouncing words properly, answer any questions they have about when to use certain words, etc. I rarely actually planned a lesson, and we do not really ""plan"" and entire lesson because there is already an English textbook each school uses, so you just have the students go along from that. The school year starts in April and they usually have ALTs start in May (at least at my school) then there is a 6 week summer break in the last 2 weeks of July and all of August. I work about 15 days a month and I think that is normal for this position at a public school. I got paid a bit less than $2000 YOU.S. per month. I took the train and my daily far cost around $15. You can drive to work here too, but most of the roads are toll roads so you have to pay either way. Usually the last month you would work is January/February because there is a lot of testing in the end of the year (March) and they do not want to pay you if they are not having classes most days. I am not sure what else to add, I could go into more detail but this is already kind of long already. Most of the positions I have seen are not looking for someone who is necessarily a teacher, just a native english speaker. Oh and I took pictures of my school lunch everyday, so I could put them on imgur if you are interested. Let me know if you have more questions, not sure if I answered everything you were curious about. Are you a native english speaker too? Are you interested in teaching in Japan?

highschoolteachers,"I have very mixed opinions. I think Lockhart has the wrong idea about math and music. I teach math and am a part-time musician, and in both cases I learned the language first. I learned to read music and I learned basic math. The only problem I had with either was the speed at which the classes progressed; I was interested in both and many of my classmates were not. But suppose you had a different upbringing. Suppose your elementary class spends an hour a week playing with xylophones doing whatever the students want. That sounds awesome! What happens if none of them ever learn to read music or play another instrument? Nothing. Now, what if every kid comes to middle school or high school and cannot add and subtract because they spent a lot of time discussing how to draw lines through rectangles? That is a problem. If you do not want to be a musician, you will be fine not knowing much about music. If you do not want to be a mathematician, you still need to be able use numbers. It should be clear that Lockhart does not expect us teachers to STOP teaching specific skills, but rather to incorporate explorations into the classroom. We should encourage students to think critically while also teaching them some basic skills. Now, which of you a**holes do not already try your best to do that? I try my best to give students questions that encourage them to think about something even if they cannot solve it. Most of the time those come back blank because the students do not want to do that kind of work. Lockhart's ideas are great for those students that may learn to love math and devote their lives to it, but we are not only trying to educate mathematicians. Most of my best students will become engineers and they will be pissed if they have to take algebra in college because I spent all of their time trying to convince them to be a mathematician. Just like many musicians, my students want to get to college with the basic skills they need to succeed. Most of those skills will not be memorized formulae, but some will be. Sometimes they will experiment and sometimes I will just tell them how to do something. I let them experiment to guess what the power rule is, but I do not make them try to figure out the best way to define a limit. That took humanity about 100 years. Finally (wow! you made it this far, thanks), I think Lockhart has built a strawman with his ""standard school mathematics curriculum"". Sure we had to memorize multiplications tables, but we also experimented with blocks to find volumes of cubes. Also &gt;Students are taught to view mathematics as a set of procedures, akin to religious rites, which are eternal and set in stone come on. He has some very good ideas, but he writes in black and white (of course literally, but I mean that figuratively too). I would prefer it if he wrote a book with some of his classroom activities that he uses instead of just complaining that everyone else does a bad job. Overall I support him and some of his thoughts, but I do not think everything is as bad as he makes it out to be, and I do not think doing things his way would necessarily fix things.

highschoolteachers,"Cinema is a subject I currently teach in a high school. Here are some of the resources I have collected. **[iStopMotion for iPad](http://boinx.com/istopmotion/ipad/)** In your post, you mention the kids made clay sculptures. These would be great to use with iStopMotion if you have iPads. I have used this with younger students, I think with some help from an adult even three year olds could use it. **[GoldieBlox and the Movie Machine](http://www.goldieblox.com/products/goldieblox_and_the_movie_machine)** Although this is designed as a toy marketed to young girls, I will be using it with my grade ten students this year. This is a great way for students to get an idea of how motion pictures work, by creating their own animations made up of twelve drawings. I will be introducing the project with this video by Walt Disney on [The Story of the Animated Drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnQSLxJmMg). **[Journeys in Film](http://journeysinfilm.org/films/)** These resources connect feature-length, English- and foreign-language narrative and documentary films to subjects like English, History, and Science. The activities included engage students in active learning in a variety of ways, from discussions to hands on activities. **[Teachers Guide Series](http://www.oscars.org/educational-programs/teachers-guide-series) by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences** This series of teachers guides explore the art and science of motion pictures. The guides include activities designed to capitalize on students' natural interest in current films to develop visual literacy skills.

highschoolteachers,"Yes, apologies! I would 100% recommend against teaching in FL if you want to work in an environment that is flexible, funded, or equitable towards its staff and students. I taught in three counties in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area middle and high school English. My experiences again and again in the public school system was that school staffs were largely negative, under trained, and general non-supportive. The federal government was also unforgiving being Republican run. Rick Scott cut over one billion dollars in his first year as Governor. Then there was inside the schools. I was raised in a Lutheran private school and found myself daydreaming through my education. There was no differentiation in instruction for various learning styles. It was very one size fits all. I found the same thing working extensively in the public high schools. The state-written curriculum was all worksheets that taught to the test, and severely underestimated its student audience with material that was irrelevant and dull. There was also a disregard for diversity. I found the curriculum provided did not reflect diversity in the novels chosen or the writings prompts presented and in general there was a conservative tilt among the faculties. Seattle is a whole other world. For one, the students are extremely intelligent and aware of themselves. This is largely because Seattle is an educated population. The city has a burgeoning economy because of its tech industry that draws lots of liberal wealth to the city. In my experience the students have a lot of equanimity for their peers (religion, race, orientation), are aware of local politics, involved in their communities, and in general are well read. Right now I am working in the independent school system in Seattle. Now to preface this, it costs $20 grand a year to send your kids to one of these schools (K-12). That being said, these schools are literally dream schools. The staff is passionate and in love with their job. Professional development is highly encouraged and paid for. The students are humble and eager to learn (not to mention ridiculously well-behaved). The curriculum is flexible and always adapting. Technology is largely integrated in the classroom. From what I have witnessed, the public schools here are also leagues above what I worked with in FL. Seattle is a healthy, quickly growing city. Outside of Seattle and Tacoma most of WA is small mountain town... I cannot speak for those schools. Teaching in Seattle has been surreal, easily any teacher's dream. I am working in schools where people love what they do, where kids love coming to school, and where tests are not taught to. In History the other day I was teaching my fourth graders about America's Japanese internment camps during WWII. I was like ""Dang, in FL everything was so 'ra-ra-America' I did not even know we had internment camps!""",yes apology would recommend teaching fly want work environment flexible funded equitable towards staff student taught three county tampa it petersburg area english experience public system staff largely negative trained general non supportive federal government also unforgiving republican run rick scott cut one billion dollar first year governor inside school raised lutheran private found daydreaming education differentiation instruction various learning style one size fit found thing working extensively public school state written curriculum worksheet taught test severely underestimated student audience material irrelevant dull also disregard diversity found curriculum provided reflect diversity novel chosen writing prompt presented general conservative tilt among faculty seattle whole world one student extremely intelligent aware largely seattle educated population city burgeoning economy tech industry draw lot liberal wealth city experience student lot equanimity peer religion race orientation aware local politics involved community general well read right working independent system seattle preface cost grand year send kid one school i said school literally dream school staff passionate love job professional development highly encouraged paid student humble eager learn mention ridiculously well behaved curriculum flexible always adapting technology largely integrated classroom witnessed public school also league worked fly seattle healthy quickly growing city outside seattle tacoma wa small mountain town cannot speak school teaching seattle surreal easily teacher dream working school people love kid love coming test taught history day teaching fourth grader america japanese internment camp wwii like dang fly everything ra ra america even know internment camp
highschoolteachers,"What makes me frustrated is that this kind of stuff still trips *me* up, let alone young students. I had to learn for my self what calculus really was, and what the point of it was. Nothing in high school or college ever bothered to explain it to me. Also, I recently went back to school for a grad degree in applied math with 10 years since college calculus, which was going to be an uphill battle to begin with, but I was incredibly frustrated by the terminology and formalism. Take the mean value theorem, for example. To me, it is just about the simplest, most intuitive idea in the world. I could explain it to a child: ""Draw a straight line, realize you cannot draw another line connecting two points on that line without matching the 'steepness' of the original line at some point on your way,"" and you are most of the way there. But I read the whole page in our Advanced Calculus book not knowing WTF it was talking about until I finally realized it was just a hackneyed way of explaining the mean value theorem.",make frustrated kind stuff still trip let alone young student learn self calculus really point nothing college ever bothered explain also recently went back grad degree applied math year since college calculus going uphill battle begin incredibly frustrated terminology formalism take mean value theorem example simplest intuitive idea world could explain child draw straight line realize cannot draw another line connecting two point line without matching sleepless original line point way way read whole page advanced calculus book knowing wif talking finally realized hackneyed way explaining mean value theorem

highschoolteachers,"I currently work in a school (high school ELA teacher here) that went from being one of the most positive environments I have ever been able to work in, to a toxic, back-stabbing zero-tolerance bullshit zone in a matter of 6 months (new superintendent and principal). This new environment has been bubbling since day 1 this year and just this past week hit a new low. There have been a slew of new hires, so that too has contributed to the new culture of the school as well. The jovial nature of the building where everyone seemed to get along well, has been substituted with back-stabbing, uber sensitive, and extreme political correctness. We now have a culture of tattle-taling. The worst part about everything is that the newly hired principal (a teacher who made the jump to admin) came across as the best possible hire, that would understand the plight of being an educator, has done a 180 and seems to have forgotten in 6 months. It really sucks! I thought I would be in this school for the long haul and now I am looking at new schools for next year, or simply get out of education altogether, since this is a reality in many places, at least the districts/schools in my area. We had the best reputation, it was the type of place teachers came to work until retirement, very little turnover. I considered myself so lucky. I love the students, I coach as well, and even so I feel like I need to get out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

highschoolteachers,"We have AVID at our school, and I am getting a class of it next year. AVID is a curriculum that, as Rabbit said, is oriented to students who will be the first in their family to go to college. It is not de facto honors, though they push for the students to take honors courses, but there is a big focus on organization, WICOR strategies, note-taking, and the like. It is also a kind of familial atmosphere, since that group of students will, by and large, stay together in that class for all 4 years of high school. What you will see, even if you do not teach an AVID course, is that they will have binders they have to keep up with and Cornell style is mandated in notes. It is a solid program, in my experience, and I enjoy it when I have AVID kids in my classes.",avid getting class next year avid curriculum rabbit said oriented student first family go college de facto honor though push student take honor course big focus organization minor strategy note taking like also kind familial atmosphere since group student large stay together class year see even teach avid course binder keep cornell style mandated note solid program experience enjoy avid kid class
highschoolteachers,"I teach in a standards-based district. I was hesitant at first, but now I love it. Here is my setup: - I give some homework/practice (high school math). Students get a stamp/sticker on a chart if they have the work complete. - Maybe 1 homework every two weeks I will collect for an assessment grade, and I collect it the day after we go over it in class so students have a chance to ask questions/make corrections. - We do traditional quizzes/tests. The school also has a policy that students can retake any assessment to show growth. In my class, in order to do a retake, they must have all those homework stamps filled in before they can do a retake. - If they do a retake, suck, and want to try AGAIN, then they have to do some extra work to show that they have progressed; they cannot just try and try and try. Pros: overall less grading. It allows (somewhat) for students to work at their own comfort level and self-regulate because they can choose not to do homework if they feel like they understand it. Their grade reflects their current level of understanding - an early F does not have to haunt you all year. Cons: Students do not do homework/practice when they need to, and there is little I can do to motivate them. The attitude that ""I will just retake it"" is prevalent. It does not really prepare them for life after high school because there are not hard deadlines and consequences for not meeting them.",teach standard based district hesitant first love setup give homework practice math student get stamp sticker chart work complete maybe homework every two week collect assessment grade collect day go class student chance ask question make correction traditional quiz test also policy student retake assessment show growth class order retake must homework stamp filled retake retake suck want try extra work show progressed cannot try try try pro overall le grading allows somewhat student work comfort level self regulate choose homework feel like understand grade reflects current level understanding early i haunt year con student homework practice need little motivate attitude retake prevalent really prepare life hard deadline consequence meeting
highschoolteachers,"I teach 8th grade in a K-8 school which has an unwritten no-homework policy. We can technically give homework, but it is not supposed to be used in grading (we are a standards based school).

In grade 6, the first year of junior high here, the teachers realized how bored I was and the next school year I was bumped to grade 8. It was hell. I had no problem with the curriculum - still top of the class with a little more challenge. But I was a pariah. There was a petition from the students to stop me from skipping grade 7. The older pupils hated that the youngest kid was better than them and I was bullied for 2 years until I moved to high school. You know how vicious 13 year-olds can be. I so wish I had been bumped forward in primary school. There just is not bullying of that kind amongst 6-year-olds. I am sure they would not have realised what happened You do not have to have your kid bumped at all, of course.

highschoolteachers,"Why did you become a teacher? I have wanted to be a teacher since I was five years old. My ""playroom"" as a child was actually designed to be a classroom. Oddly enough, a boy in my ""class"" with the same exact name as my brother kept getting detentions. Ironic, eh? Ultimately when I decided this was the path for me (about 4 years after high school), I knew it was the right path because I wanted to work a job where my energy was spent genuinely influencing other people. What have been the high points of being a teacher? I started my career working in a title 1 school, which is where I have been for the past 3 years. These kids need teachers who care. When students come to me just to talk about their lives, I know I matter to them. I am someone they can count on when they cannot count on others. That is more important to me than teaching them pre-algebra. Although, I will say, when a kid has been struggling with a concept and he or she finally gets it. That is cool, too. But, teaching is so much more than academics. ...The low points? For the same reasons as my high points, my low points exist. Teaching public urban education means some kids and families legitimately do not care. What so ever. I had a parent tell an administrator before, ""Do whatever you want at school, I do not care. Do not call me."" When you see how little education is valued in so many lives, it can surely take a toll on you. What advice would you give to new teachers? Do not take anything personally. Kids do and say the weirdest stuff. It has nothing, usually, to do with you. What should new teachers focus on most? The first year is all about survival. The second year, you will work really hard because you will realize all the stuff you should have done. You will start to make a difference your third year. Basically, keep going. It gets better. Focus on getting through the day. Constantly reflect. Ask yourself what went well and what did not. Adjust accordingly. What is your teaching philosophy? I personally subscribe to a philosophy of Arete. There is always something at which you can be better. Keep going. I try to instill that in my students. Everyone can be successful, but there is a balance between home, school, and student. All students are capable with the correct supports and determination.",become teacher wanted teacher since five year old playroom child actually designed classroom oddly enough boy class exact name brother kept getting detention ironic eh ultimately decided path year knew right path wanted work job energy spent genuinely influencing people point teacher started career working title past year kid need teacher care student come talk life know matter someone count cannot count others important teaching pre algebra although say kid struggling concept finally get cool teaching much academic low point reason point low point exist teaching public urban education mean kid family legitimately care ever parent tell administrator whatever want care call see little education valued many life surely take toll advice would give new teacher take anything personally kid say weirdest stuff nothing usually new teacher focus first year survival second year work really hard realize stuff done start make difference third year basically keep going get better focus getting day constantly reflect ask went well adjust accordingly teaching philosophy personally subscribe philosophy arewe always something better keep going try instill student everyone successful balance home student student capable correct support determination
highschoolteachers,"I was a college drop-out who became a teacher by accident - a series of events that took me from theater to museum presentation to an MAT in teaching with technology to a media specialist to an ITS gig to a full-time classroom teacher. Never planned to be a teacher in any way. SO blessed. High points are numerous, but include working my way towards full-time teaching of my own curriculum (media literacy and communications theory), teacher leadership and governance at local and state level - I really am good at teaching teaching itself - and 22 years of student successes from every type of kid, from driven prep school geniuses to about-to-drop-out inner city ninth graders. Senior class advisorship was an amazing ride. Living with my students in the apartment of a prep school dorm was a true joy, and everyone should try it for at least a year. Low points have been numerous, too. Last year was one of the worst years of my life due to an inept but cruel evaluator and a lack of support but plenty of blame for a class from hell. Advice for new teachers could fill a book, and does. But the biggest thing to focus on for newbies these days, I think, is developing a habit of deliberate backwards design at all levels - it will be evident in clear objectives and methods, so serve evaluation criteria, and is so satisfying when it works. Also: never be afraid to try a strategy for classroom management; you will learn as you go along, but always try strategies with full and deliberate commitment, or suffer the consequences. My teaching philosophy: 1. It is the minds that matter, not the material. When people ask you what you teach, think ""I teach students."" 2. Teaching students to embrace and welcome the discomfort of not understanding something at first is the prerequisite for all learning. Teach it first, and reteach it often. 3. If it is not fun for you, it is not fun for the students. And if we are not having fun, we are doing it wrong. 4. Sing all day. Out loud. I greet my inner city high school kids with ""It is a beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" most days. 5. Always keep your door open.
